New Jersey Man Sentenced to Federal Prison for Fraudulently Obtaining Bank Loans Guaranteed by the Small Business Administration,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/new-jersey-man-sentenced-federal-prison-fraudulently-obtaining,2025-10-16,2025,"Baltimore, Maryland – U.S. District Judge Deborah K. Chasanow sentenced Mehul Ramesh Khatiwala, 43, aka “Mike Khatiwala,” of Voorhees, New Jersey, to seven years in federal prison, followed by five years of supervised release, in connection with his role supervising a multi-million-dollar bank fraud conspiracy.  Khatiwala and his co-conspirators schemed to fraudulently obtain more than $35 million in Small Business Administration (SBA) loans from financial institutions that they used in a hotel flipping scheme involving the purchase and sale of hotels.  Judge Chasanow also ordered Khatiwala to forfeit $6,000,000, pay restitution of $6,010,655.72, and pay a $100,000 fine.
This is Khatiwala’s second federal conviction and sentencing for bank fraud charges.  In April 2019, Khatiwala pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud and three counts of bank fraud involving criminal conduct dating back to about 2011 through about 2014. In April 2021, Judge Chasanow sentenced Khatiwala to multiple years of incarceration, ordered forfeiture and restitution, and a term of supervised release in connection with his criminal conduct from 2011 to 2014.
Kelly O. Hayes, U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland, announced the sentence with Special Agent in Charge Robert Manchak, Federal Housing Finance Agency Office of Inspector General (FHFA-OIG), and Special Agent in Charge Jeffrey D. Pittano, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC-OIG) – Mid-Atlantic Region.
According to the factual stipulations in his guilty plea, Khatiwala was the owner and managing member of Delaware Hotel Group LLC (DHG), and an operator of GMK Consulting LLC (GMK) and KPG Hotel Mgmt. LLC (KPG). These LLCs were hotel management and loan brokerage companies located in Mount Laurel, New Jersey. Co-defendant Rajendra G. Parikh, 64, of Monroe, New Jersey, was also an owner of KPG.  Co-defendant Jennifer Watkins, 48, of Marlton, New Jersey, served as a project coordinator for DHG and managing member of Forza Consulting LLC (Forza), a hotel consulting and loan brokerage company located in Marlton, New Jersey.  Co-defendant Rebecca Marie Cohn, 38, aka Rebecca Marie Stanton, was a settlement and title processor for Residential Title & Escrow Company, a real estate title company located in Owings Mills, Maryland, that offered escrow and loan-settlement services.
From August 2018 through February 2020, Khatiwala, Parikh, and Watkins conspired to obtain loan proceeds to buy and sell hotels in connection with a hotel-flipping scheme. “Flipping” is a real estate investment strategy that involves purchasing property to hold for a short period before selling it to make a quick profit.  During the SBA-loan application process, the co-conspirators made and caused others to make material misrepresentations and omissions to financial institutions regarding the sellers’ identity, familial relationships between parties, and the nature and amount of the equity injected by the borrowers.  The defendants sought loans through the SBA’s Section 7(a) Program, which guaranteed and insured approximately 75-85 percent of these loans, and required that the small business owner/borrower invest a certain amount of their own money into the business to qualify for the loan.
Khatiwala, Parikh, and Watkins admitted that they created shell companies using co-conspirators as straw owners of the entities.  These straw owners had no actual ownership interest in the entities as Khatiwala and Parikh were the true owners.  The straw owners signed purchase contracts, operating agreements, and related documents to buy hotel properties in the name of the shell companies.
The co-conspirators, supervised in part by Khatiwala, then created a second company to purchase the hotels from the shell companies at substantially higher prices.  After the co-conspirators formed the companies to control both sides of the flip transaction, they solicited banks for small-business loans to finance the buying company’s purchase of the hotel from the straw companies.  The co-conspirators helped the buying companies qualify for the loans by falsely representing investors’ equity injections to the banks, among other materially false statements, misrepresentations, and omissions.  The financial institutions extending the loans relied on the false statements and misrepresentations.
In July 2025, Judge Chasanow sentenced co-defendant Jennifer Watkins, 48, of Marlton, New Jersey, to 36 months in federal prison, followed by three years of supervised release, in connection with her role in the bank fraud conspiracy.  Co-defendant Rajendra G. Parikh is awaiting a sentencing date.
U.S. Attorney Hayes commended the FHFA-OIG, FDIC-OIG, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for their work in the investigation.  Ms. Hayes also thanked Assistant U.S. Attorneys Harry M. Gruber and Ari D. Evans, who are prosecuting the federal case, and recognized Paralegal Specialist Joanna B.N. Huber, who provided legal support for the case.

Startup CEO Charlie Javice Sentenced To 85 Months In Prison For $175 Million Fraud,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/startup-ceo-charlie-javice-sentenced-85-months-prison-175,2025-09-29,2025,"Attorney for the United States, Acting Under Authority Conferred by 28 U.S.C. § 515, Amanda Houle announced that CHARLIE JAVICE was sentenced today to 85 months in prison for falsely and dramatically inflating the number of customers of her company, Frank, to fraudulently induce J.P. Morgan Chase (“JPMC”) to acquire Frank for $175 million.  JAVICE and her co-defendant, OLIVIER AMAR, were convicted of conspiracy, wire fraud, bank fraud, and securities fraud following a six-week jury trial in March 2025. Today’s sentence was imposed by U.S. District Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein.
“Javice perpetrated a $175 million fraud—repeatedly lying about the success of her startup company and even hiring a data scientist to create fake data to back up her lies.  For that, Javice has been sentenced to 85 months’ imprisonment and ordered to pay over $300,000,000,” said Attorney for the United States Amanda Houle.  “Today’s sentence sends a clear message that brazen frauds will be met with serious penalties.  Our Office will continue to work tirelessly to hold accountable those who seek to profit through fraudulent schemes and lies.”
As set forth in public filings and the trial record:
In or about 2017, JAVICE founded Frank, a for-profit company that offered an online platform designed to simplify the process of filling out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (“FAFSA”).  FAFSA is a federal government form, available free of charge, that students use to apply for financial aid for college or graduate school.  JAVICE was Frank’s CEO.  AMAR was Frank’s Chief Growth Officer.
In or about 2021, JAVICE began to pursue the sale of Frank to a larger financial institution. Two major banks, one of which was JPMC, expressed interest and began acquisition processes with Frank.  JAVICE represented repeatedly to those banks that Frank had 4.25 million customers or “users.”  JAVICE explicitly defined “users”—to both banks—as individuals who had signed up for an account with Frank and for whom Frank therefore had at least four identified categories of data ( i.e. , first name, last name, email address, and phone number).  In fact, Frank had approximately 300,000 users.
When JPMC sought to verify the number of Frank’s users and the amount of data collected about them—information that was critical to JPMC’s decision to move forward with the acquisition process—JAVICE and AMAR fabricated a data set.  To do this, JAVICE and AMAR first asked Frank’s director of engineering to create an artificially generated (so-called “synthetic”) data set. The director of engineering raised concerns about the legality of the request, to which JAVICE responded, in substance and in part, “We don’t want to end up in orange jumpsuits.”  The director of engineering declined the request.
JAVICE then approached an outside data scientist and hired him to create the synthetic data set. After the data set was created, JAVICE provided that synthetic data set to an agreed-upon third-party vendor in an effort to confirm to JPMC that the data set had over 4.25 million rows.  JAVICE then caused the third-party vendor to convey to JPMC that the data set had over 4.25 million rows, consistent with JAVICE’s misrepresentations that Frank had 4.25 million users.
In reliance on JAVICE’s fraudulent representations about Frank’s users, JPMC agreed to purchase Frank for $175 million.  As part of the deal, JPMC hired JAVICE and other Frank employees.  JAVICE received over $21 million for selling her equity stake in Frank and, per the terms of the deal, was to be paid another $20 million as a retention bonus.
Unbeknownst to JPMC, at or about the same time that JAVICE was creating the fabricated data set, JAVICE and AMAR sought to purchase, on the open market, real data for over 4.25 million college students to cover up their misrepresentations.  JAVICE and AMAR succeeded in purchasing a data set of 4.5 million students for $105,000, but it did not contain all the data fields that JAVICE had represented to JPMC were maintained by Frank.  JAVICE then purchased an additional set of data on the open market to augment the data set of 4.5 million users.  After JPMC acquired Frank, JPMC employees asked JAVICE and AMAR to provide data relating to Frank’s users so that JPMC could begin a marketing campaign to those users.  In response, JAVICE provided what was supposedly Frank’s user data.  In fact, JAVICE fraudulently provided the data she and AMAR had purchased on the open market, at a small fraction of the price that JPMC paid to acquire Frank and its purported users.
*                      *                      *
In addition to the prison term, JAVICE, 31, of Miami Beach, Florida, was sentenced to three years of supervised release. The district court also imposed a forfeiture judgment of $22,360,977.48 and ordered restitution in the amount of $287,501,078.00 that is joint and several with AMAR.
Ms. Houle praised the outstanding investigative work of the Special Agents from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s Office of Inspector General.
The case is being handled by the Office’s Complex Frauds and Cybercrime Unit.  Assistant U.S. Attorneys Nicholas W. Chiuchiolo, Micah F. Fergenson, and Georgia V. Kostopoulos are in charge of the prosecution.

As detailed in the information filed August 21, 2025, the defendant served as a licensed residential real estate agent and the co-founder and principal agent for The Barach Group, LLC, a Philadelphia-based real estate team, and formed a second company, TBG Real Estate, LLC, also based in the city. In addition to offering traditional real estate agent services, Barach used his companies to solicit and raise money for non-existent real estate financing opportunities.
Between July 2017 and April 2021, Barach raised over $3 million from lenders through a series of material misrepresentations, including by falsely stating the raised funds would be used to provide bridge loans to builders and contractors looking to purchase and flip distressed real estate properties or to complete renovation projects. At the time of these solicitations, no such projects existed, Barach’s entities did not provide real estate financing, and Barach knew that the lenders’ funds would be used for his own purposes and debts.
None of the money raised by Barach from his victims was used for the stated purpose. Instead, Barach typically withdrew the funds in cash, made assorted personal expenditures, transferred funds to his personal bank accounts, and moved large sums to various accounts that he held with casinos and sportsbook operations. Although Barach paid back some of his earlier lenders with a portion of the funding secured from later lenders, over $1.4 million of the fraudulently obtained loan proceeds remain unpaid.
The defendant is scheduled to be sentenced on February 2, 2026, and faces a maximum possible term of 30 years’ imprisonment.
This case was investigated by the FDIC Office of Inspector General, IRS Criminal Investigation, and the FBI, with assistance from the U.S. Secret Service, and is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys Terri Marinari and Samuel Dalke.

Former Bank of O’Fallon executive sentenced to prison for swindling $2 million in check kiting fraud scheme,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/former-bank-ofallon-executive-sentenced-prison-swindling-2,2025-09-18,2025,"EAST ST. LOUIS, Ill. – A district judge sentenced the former second-in-command of the Bank of O’Fallon to 63 months’ imprisonment after he admitted to federal charges for engaging in a fraud scheme to obtain more than $2 million.
Andrew P. Blassie, 70, of St. Louis, pleaded guilty to one count of bank fraud and one count of interstate transportation of security or funds obtained by fraud. In addition to imprisonment, he was ordered to pay $2,461,887.67 in restitution.
“Blassie’s prison sentence underscores the severity of his crimes to betray his clients, employer, family, and community,” said U.S. Attorney Steven D. Weinhoeft. “The outstanding work by the investigators and the Bank of O’Fallon’s vital cooperation to dismantle this scheme delivered justice and helped to protect the integrity of our financial system.”
According to the indictment, Blassie served as the Executive Vice President for the Bank of O’Fallon and defrauded the bank out of $1,972,887.67 in a check kite scheme from September 2023 through September 2024 during his employment.
Blassie admitted to falsely inflating the balance of his personal checking account at the Bank of O’Fallon by depositing checks he knew to be backed by non-sufficient funds. He deposited checks with non-sufficient funds from four personal accounts at three other banks and one credit union into the Bank of O’Fallon account.
“The U.S. Secret Service is committed to pursuing criminal actors who seek to rip off law-abiding citizens and undermine our nation’s financial system in the process. This was an outrageous scheme that hurt innocent victims,” said acting Resident Agent in Charge David Bolin, of the U.S. Secret Service’s Springfield Resident Office. “I am proud of our agency’s work in this case. Thanks to the U.S. Attorney’s Office of the Southern District of Illinois as well as our federal and local law enforcement partners who helped to bring justice for the victims, including the O’Fallon Police Department.”
Blassie paid nearly $2.7 million for personal expenses from the falsely inflated account thus using funds belonging to the Bank of O’Fallon. As the former Executive Vice President, Blassie used his position to conceal his fraud from the Bank of O’Fallon by scrubbing his name and account number from suspected kiting reports.
“Today’s sentencing brings justice to the defendant, who violated his position of trust as Executive Vice President at the Bank of O’Fallon. He defrauded the bank of approximately $2 million through a check kiting scheme that he used to enrich himself,” said Special Agent in Charge Vincent R. Zehme, of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC OIG), Chicago Region. “This case exhibits the FDIC OIG’s steadfast commitment to working with our law enforcement partners to hold bank insiders, and other perpetrators of fraud, accountable for their role in such schemes, especially those that threaten the safety and soundness of our Nation’s financial institutions.”
From August 2022 through September 2024, Blassie also persuaded a couple from Lebanon, Illinois, to give him $489,000 of their retirement savings. In return for this investment, Blassie gave the couple two promissory notes. He agreed to pay the couple interest on the notes and used money he obtained through his check kite scheme to pay some of that interest.
As security for his promissory notes, Blassie pledged 128 of his and his wife’s shares of the holding company which owns the Bank of O’Fallon.
“Today’s sentencing holds accountable and brings to justice a former bank executive who abused his position to defraud Bank of O’Fallon and its customers,” said Don Daley, Acting Assistant Special Agent in Charge, Western Region, Office of Inspector General for the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. “We are proud to have worked with our law enforcement partners to achieve this result. We will continue to vigorously pursue those who undermine the safety and soundness of our banking institutions.”
According to the indictment, Blassie later sold most of these shares and did not use those funds to repay the Lebanon couple. This left the couple with no means of recourse when Blassie later defaulted on the promissory notes.
“Bank officials who abuse their positions of public trust for personal gain pose an unacceptable threat to the integrity the Federal Home Loan Bank system,” said Korey Brinkman, Special Agent in Charge of the Federal Housing Finance Agency Office of Inspector General’s Central Region.  “Today’s sentencing demonstrates our ongoing commitment to investigating thoroughly allegations of fraud involving bank officials and supporting the prosecution of those charged with these offenses.  We are proud to work with our investigative partners and the U.S. Attorney’s Office to ensure insider fraudsters are held accountable under the law.”
Officials with the Bank of O’Fallon have fully cooperated with law enforcement during the investigation.
The O’Fallon Police Department, U.S. Secret Service, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General, the Office of Inspector General for the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and the Federal Housing Finance Agency, Office of Inspector General made contributions to the investigation.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Zoe Gross prosecuted the case.

Construction Company CEO Arrested for Amassing Real Estate Empire Through $4 Million in Fraudulently Obtained Covid-19 Relief Loans,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/construction-company-ceo-arrested-amassing-real-estate-empire,2025-09-05,2025,"A Visalia construction company CEO was arrested today on a federal criminal complaint alleging that he fraudulently obtained more than $4 million in taxpayer-funded COVID-19 relief funds and federally guaranteed small business loans, U.S. Attorney Eric Grant announced.
According to court documents, between April and June 2020, Joey Wayne Mackey, 45, of Visalia, submitted fraudulent Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan applications for three of his companies: Forcum-Mackey Construction Inc., a general contractor based in Ivanhoe; JWM Inc., a purported construction consulting company for which Mackey is the sole proprietor based in Mackey’s Visalia home; and Mack Aviation LLC, a provider of refueling and hangar‑rental services for charter jets at Visalia Municipal Airport.
All three of these applications contained fraudulent numbers of employees and monthly payroll cost calculations, which caused a bank, serving as a lending partner funding the COVID-19 relief through guaranteed small business loans, to disburse $4,082,550 in funds it otherwise would not have given. Over the following months, Mackey laundered the PPP loan funds through fraudulent payroll payments to family members (including his minor children), while Mackey controlled the bank accounts of those family members. In October 2020, Mackey then pulled the funds out of the family member accounts to buy revenue-generating real estate acquisitions, such as office parks and luxury apartment complexes from which he enriched himself further through rent payments from tenants. Mackey continued making real estate investments and luxury goods purchases traceable to PPP funds through at least 2023.
This case is the product of an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General, and the Small Business Administration Office of Inspector General. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Calvin Lee and Kevin Khasigian are prosecuting the case.
If convicted, Mackey faces a maximum statutory penalty of 30 years in prison and a $1 million fine. Any sentence, however, would be determined at the discretion of the court after consideration of any applicable statutory factors and the federal Sentencing Guidelines, which take into account a number of variables. The charges are only allegations; the defendant is presumed innocent until and unless proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.

Galeotti of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. “The defendant’s egregious scheme relied on layers of deception to steal taxpayer money to buy himself luxury vehicles, residential properties, and jewelry. The Criminal Division remains dedicated to holding fraudsters who steal from the public fisc to account for their greed.”
“The defendant in this case fraudulently obtained $15.9 million from federal funding programs intended to provide government relief to businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic and instead diverted vital relief funds for his own personal benefit,” said Special Agent in Charge Tyler Hatcher of the IRS Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI) Los Angeles Field Office. “IRS-CI is proud to partner with our federal law enforcement organizations to investigate and ensure relief funds are spent in accordance with their original intended purposes.""
“Exploiting pandemic relief meant for struggling Americans is not only morally reprehensible, it’s a betrayal of public trust,” said Assistant Director Jose A. Perez of the FBI Criminal Investigative Division. “This defendant orchestrated a multimillion-dollar fraud scheme, weaponizing federal COVID-19 assistance programs for his personal gain. The FBI will always work to make sure those who steal from programs designed to help others are held accountable.”
“The defendant in this case submitted dozens of fraudulent loan applications to obtain millions of dollars from government programs designed to assist struggling businesses during the pandemic,” said Special Agent in Charge Patricia Tarasca of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC OIG), New York Region. “Today's guilty plea brings him to justice. The FDIC OIG remains committed to working with our law enforcement partners to hold accountable those who stole from COVID-19 relief programs in order to enrich themselves, and threatened the stability of our Nation's financial system.”
“Providing false information to gain access to SBA programs intended for disaster victims is unacceptable,” said Acting Special Agent in Charge Jonathan Huang of the Small Business Association Office of Inspector General’s (SBA-OIG) Western Region. “OIG is focused on rooting out bad actors in these vital SBA programs. I want to thank the Department of Justice, and our law enforcement partners for their dedication and commitment to seeing justice served.”
According to court documents, from April 2020 to April 2022, Emanuel Tucker, 45, of Canyon Lake, California, and other co-conspirators, submitted several dozen fraudulent PPP and EIDL loan applications on behalf of various companies that he owned and controlled. These applications contained material misrepresentations about the companies, including the number of employees, average monthly payroll, gross revenue, cost of goods, and supporting documents. The defendant used the fraudulently obtained funds to purchase a variety of luxury items, such as a Cadillac Escalade, a Bently Continental, and a Ferrari F8 Tributo, multiple million-dollar houses, and various jewelry, including a $63,000 diamond ring and a $400,000 diamond necklace.
Tucker pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud and bank fraud. Tucker faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison, and sentencing is scheduled for Dec. 4. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.
The IRS-CI, FBI, SBA-OIG, FDIC OIG, Federal Reserve Board Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Office of Inspector General, Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, and Department of Energy Office of Inspector General are investigating the case.

Man Sentenced for Over $11M COVID-19 Relief Fraud and Money Laundering Scheme,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/man-sentenced-over-11m-covid-19-relief-fraud-and-money,2025-08-21,2025,"A Nevada man was sentenced today to over 15 years in prison and five years of supervised release for fraudulently obtaining more than $11 million in Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (SBA) under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act and then laundering the funds through real estate transactions, gambling activity, and luxury purchases. The defendant was also ordered to pay restitution in the amount of $11,793,064.15, forfeiture in the amount of $11,231,186.52, and to forfeit two vehicles and five properties.
“This defendant stole more than $11 million in taxpayer funds that he used to finance luxury purchases and gambling,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Matthew R. Galeotti of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. “Prosecuting schemes like this is critical to protecting the contributions of hard-working Americans, preserving confidence in government relief programs, and ensuring that aid reaches those who truly need it. This sentence demonstrates the Criminal Division’s continuing commitment to protecting the public’s money from thieves and fraudsters.”
“The consequences of the defendant’s PPP loan fraud scheme have caught up with him and now he will be incarcerated for exploiting more than $11.2 million from a taxpayer-funded program,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Sigal Chattah for the District of Nevada. “Thanks to the diligent work of our law enforcement partners, the defendant is being held accountable for defrauding the government.”
“This lengthy sentence shows how seriously the American government takes PPP loan fraud,” said Special Agent in Charge Carissa Messick of IRS Criminal Investigation’s (IRS-CI) Phoenix Field Office. “This loan program was created to support small businesses and their employees during a once in a lifetime pandemic. When Mr. Dezfooli fraudulently obtained these loans, he not only stole from the Small Business Administration, but also from American taxpayers to the tune of $11.2 million. This sentencing is a testament to IRS-CI’s dedication to protecting American taxpayers and ensuring the integrity of our tax system.”
“Today’s sentencing holds accountable and brings to justice a fraudster who stole millions of taxpayer dollars intended to help small business owners,” said Special Agent in Charge Jon Ellwanger of the Office of Inspector General for the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Western Region. “We are proud to have worked with our federal law enforcement partners and the U.S. Attorney’s Office to achieve this result.”
“Mr. Dezfooli falsified loan applications to fraudulently obtain PPP loan proceeds that he used to enrich himself to the detriment of legitimate business struggling during the pandemic,” said Special Agent in Charge Ryan Korner of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC-OIG). “The defendant’s actions not only defrauded the PPP loan program but also disadvantaged business owners who were actually entitled to the benefits. FDIC OIG is committed to working alongside our law enforcement partners to protect the Nation’s Financial System and hold accountable those individuals, like Mr. Dezfooli, who steal benefits designated to help those in need.”
According to evidence presented at trial, Meelad Dezfooli, of Henderson, Nevada, submitted three fraudulent applications on behalf of entities he controlled, obtaining more than $11 million. Dezfooli supported these applications with false documents, including fabricated tax records and a utility bill, and grossly inflated the number of employees and payroll expenses of each entity.
After receiving the PPP funds, Dezfooli laundered the money by purchasing approximately 25 properties in Nevada, often using the alias “James Dez” or a fictitious entity called “Holdings Trust.” Even after he was indicted, Dezfooli continued laundering money, including selling property purchased with the illegally obtained PPP funds. He also used criminal proceeds to fund his personal investment account, buy luxury cars, and gamble extensively throughout Las Vegas. As part of this investigation, five homes were seized by law enforcement.
On Sept. 4, 2024, a jury found Dezfooli guilty of three counts of bank fraud, three counts of money laundering, and four counts of conducting transactions using criminally derived property. One of those violations related to a transaction that Dezfooli conducted after he had already been charged.
The IRS-CI, FRB-OIG, FDIC-OIG, and SBA-OIG investigated the case.
Trial Attorneys D. Zachary Adams and Taylor G. Stout of the Criminal Division’s Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section (MLARS) and Assistant U.S. Attorney Daniel R. Schiess for the District of Nevada prosecuted the case. Legal Assistant Alexa Stiles and Paralegal Holly Butler of MLARS provided substantial assistance throughout the investigation and trial.

Former Salinas Construction Company Controller Charged With Stealing More Than $8 Million Dollars From Employer,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/former-salinas-construction-company-controller-charged-stealing,2025-08-15,2025,"SAN JOSE – Monique Marie Dodson, the former controller of a Salinas construction company, was charged by information yesterday with six counts of wire fraud and one count of money laundering in connection with the alleged theft of more than $8 million from her employer.
According to the information, Dodson, 42, of Monterey County, was the controller of Company A, a civil contracting construction company headquartered in Salinas.  Beginning around October 2021 until November 2023, Dodson allegedly conducted approximately 136 unauthorized wire transfers from Company A’s business account to her personal bank accounts that she falsely characterized as payments for materials for the company.
The information alleges that Dodson used a variety of means to conceal the unauthorized transfers to avoid detection and facilitate future transfers, including by intercepting and destroying paper bank statements sent by Company A’s bank documenting the unauthorized wire transfers.  Dodson also allegedly downloaded Company A’s bank statements, modified the electronic bank statements by removing her name from wire transfer descriptions, and saved the altered bank statements in Company A’s records.  The information further alleges that Dodson concealed the unauthorized wire transfers by falsely listing them in Company A’s expense accounts in the accounting journal.
Dodson is alleged to have conducted unauthorized wires totaling approximately $8,579,647.48.
United States Attorney Craig H. Missakian, FBI Special Agent in Charge Sanjay Virmani, IRS Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI) Oakland Field Office Special Agent in Charge Linda Nguyen, and Special Agent in Charge Ryan Korner of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC-OIG) made the announcement.
Dodson is scheduled to appear in federal district court in San Jose on Aug. 19, 2025, for an initial appearance and arraignment before U.S. Magistrate Judge Nathanael Cousins.
An information merely alleges that crimes have been committed, and the defendant is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.  If convicted, the defendant faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison and a fine of $250,000 for each count of wire fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1343 and 10 years in prison and a fine of $250,000 for the count of money laundering in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1957.  Any sentence following conviction would be imposed by the court after consideration of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and the federal statute governing the imposition of a sentence, 18 U.S.C. § 3553.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Neal C. Hong is prosecuting the case with the assistance of Sahib Kaur.  The prosecution is the result of an investigation by the FBI, IRS-CI, and FDIC-OIG.

According to the information, Dodson, 42, of Monterey County, was the controller of Company A, a civil contracting construction company headquartered in Salinas.  Beginning around October 2021 until November 2023, Dodson allegedly conducted approximately 136 unauthorized wire transfers from Company A’s business account to her personal bank accounts that she falsely characterized as payments for materials for the company.
The information alleges that Dodson used a variety of means to conceal the unauthorized transfers to avoid detection and facilitate future transfers, including by intercepting and destroying paper bank statements sent by Company A’s bank documenting the unauthorized wire transfers.  Dodson also allegedly downloaded Company A’s bank statements, modified the electronic bank statements by removing her name from wire transfer descriptions, and saved the altered bank statements in Company A’s records.  The information further alleges that Dodson concealed the unauthorized wire transfers by falsely listing them in Company A’s expense accounts in the accounting journal.
Dodson is alleged to have conducted unauthorized wires totaling approximately $8,579,647.48.

Missakian, FBI Special Agent in Charge Sanjay Virmani, IRS Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI) Oakland Field Office Special Agent in Charge Linda Nguyen, and Special Agent in Charge Ryan Korner of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC-OIG) made the announcement.
Dodson is scheduled to appear in federal district court in San Jose on Aug. 19, 2025, for an initial appearance and arraignment before U.S. Magistrate Judge Nathanael Cousins.
An information merely alleges that crimes have been committed, and the defendant is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.  If convicted, the defendant faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison and a fine of $250,000 for each count of wire fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1343 and 10 years in prison and a fine of $250,000 for the count of money laundering in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1957.  Any sentence following conviction would be imposed by the court after consideration of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and the federal statute governing the imposition of a sentence, 18 U.S.C. § 3553.

U.S. District Court Judge Liles C. Burke sentenced Kellie L. Johnson, 54, of Cullman, Alabama, to 60 months in prison followed by 60 months supervised release. In May, Johnson pleaded guilty to bank embezzlement.
According to the plea agreement, Johnson was employed with First Community Bank for approximately 25 years. Between July 2013 and June 2023, Johnson embezzled money from First Community Bank’s Federal Reserve account to pay personal expenses, primarily credit card bills.  To conceal her scheme, Johnson falsified transactions to reconcile the balance of the Federal Reserve account in the bank’s general ledger and deleted her ACH transactions. Johnson also altered account statements sent by the Federal Reserve that she was required to provide to the bank president, auditors, and others. The scheme ended when the bank president received a call from the Federal Reserve notifying him that the bank’s ACH account was overdrawn. When the bank president asked Johnson to provide the latest account statement, she provided a fraudulent statement showing a positive balance in the account. Over the decade that she stole money from the bank, Johnson conducted approximately 273 fraudulent ACH transactions totaling over $2.3 million.  Additionally, Johnson deprived the bank of $138,185.40 in interest income to the Federal Reserve account.

Two Mexican Nationals Charged for Bribing State-Owned Energy Officials,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/two-mexican-nationals-charged-bribing-state-owned-energy,2025-08-11,2025,"Defendants Residing in Texas Allegedly Bribed PEMEX to Obtain Lucrative Contracts
An indictment was unsealed today in the Southern District of Texas charging two Mexican businessmen for their roles in an alleged bribery scheme to retain and obtain business related to Petróleos Mexicanos (PEMEX), the state-owned oil company of Mexico, and PEMEX Exploración y Producción (PEP), PEMEX’s wholly owned exploration and production subsidiary.
“The defendants — foreign nationals residing in the U.S. — are alleged to have bribed Mexican officials in order to rig the bidding process to secure millions of dollars of lucrative contracts and other advantages,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Matthew R. Galeotti of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. “This indictment should send a clear message that the Criminal Division will not tolerate those who enrich corrupt officials for personal gain and to the detriment of the fair market.”
“Bribery harms fair competition, erodes public trust, and will not be tolerated,” said Assistant Director Jose A. Perez of the FBI Criminal Investigation Division. “Today’s indictment underscores the commitment of the FBI, and our law enforcement partners, to fairness for communities in Texas and beyond.”
According to court documents, Ramon Alexandro Rovirosa Martinez, 46, of The Woodlands, Texas, a Mexican citizen and U.S. lawful permanent resident, and Mario Alberto Avila Lizarraga, 61, of Spring, Texas, a Mexican citizen and U.S. lawful permanent resident, together with others, allegedly conspired to pay and offered to pay at least $150,000 in bribes to officials at PEMEX and PEP in order to obtain and retain business from PEMEX and PEP for companies associated with Rovirosa.
Between at least 2019 and continuing into at least 2021, Rovirosa, Avila, and their co-conspirators allegedly offered to pay and paid bribes in the form of luxury goods, including from Louis Vuitton and Hublot, cash payments, and other valuable items, to at least three PEMEX and PEP officials in exchange for those officials taking certain actions to help companies associated with Rovirosa obtain and retain business with PEMEX and PEP. Those improper advantages helped companies associated with Rovirosa obtain contracts with PEMEX and PEP worth at least $2.5 million.
Rovirosa and Avila are each charged with one count of conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and three substantive violations of the FCPA. If convicted, each defendant faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison for each count. A federal judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors. Following his arrest, Rovirosa was arraigned today. Avila is a fugitive and remains at large.
The FBI and HSI are investigating the case, with assistance from the Office of the Inspector General for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The Justice Department’s Office of International Affairs provided critical assistance in this case.

Sacramento Woman Sentenced to 4 Years in Prison for Benefit Fraud Scheme During Pandemic,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/sacramento-woman-sentenced-4-years-prison-benefit-fraud-scheme,2025-08-07,2025,"Tabitha Leigh Markle, 53, of Sacramento, was sentenced today to four years and two months in prison for mail fraud and aggravated identity theft in a scheme to defraud the unemployment insurance benefit program during the COVID-19 pandemic, Acting U.S. Attorney Kimberly A. Sanchez announced.
“Today’s sentencing highlights the U.S. Attorney’s Office’s continuing efforts to actively prosecute fraud against the unemployment insurance program that served as a lifeline for millions during the pandemic,” said U.S. Attorney Sanchez. “We are committed to ensuring unemployment benefits go to the unemployed who need the assistance, not to thieves who believe they are above the law.”
“Tabitha Markle unlawfully obtained over $2.5 million in COVID-19 pandemic-related unemployment insurance benefits by using the personal identifying information of other people, including several inmates in California state prisons, to file fraudulent claims. She falsified employment records to make it appear that the claimants were eligible for benefits when, in fact, they were not. Many of these individuals were unwitting participants in her scheme. The illegally obtained unemployment insurance funds, which Markle used for personal gain, were intended to support American workers facing economic hardship during an unprecedented public health crisis,” said Quentin Heiden, Special Agent-in-Charge, Western Region, U.S. Department of Labor, Office of Inspector General.
According to court documents, between April 2020 and January 2021, Markle defrauded the California Employment Development Department (EDD) and the United States out of unemployment insurance benefits. Markle collected personally identifiable information (PII) including names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers and other information, and submitted fraudulent applications for unemployment insurance (UI) benefits to EDD. Markle and her associates caused the UI debit cards to be mailed to addresses she listed in the fraudulent applications. They used the cards that were issued in the names of the supposed beneficiaries to withdraw cash from ATMs throughout California. Markle and her associates often appeared in ATM surveillance photos taking out large amounts of cash from the cards. Markle and her criminal associates obtained approximately $2,599,038 from the fraud.
Markle also used the means of identification of various victims, including one victim, who was a resident of Oakland. Without the victim’s knowledge or permission, Markle filed a false unemployment insurance application with California EDD using the victim’s true name and other identifying information, but using a false email address, phone number and mailing address. Markle’s associates withdrew thousands of dollars of unemployment insurance benefits from the card issued to the victim.
This case was the product of an investigation by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General, California EDD – Investigation Division, and the United States Department of Labor Office of Inspector General. Assistant U.S. Attorney Dhruv Sharma prosecuted the case.
This effort is part of a California COVID-19 Fraud Enforcement Strike Force operation, one of five interagency COVID-19 fraud strike force teams established by the U.S. Department of Justice. The California Strike Force combines law enforcement and prosecutorial resources in the Eastern and Central Districts of California and focuses on large-scale, multistate pandemic relief fraud perpetrated by criminal organizations and transnational actors. The strike forces use prosecutor-led and data analyst-driven teams to identify and bring to justice those who stole pandemic relief funds.

According to his court documents, Mackey chatted online with whom he believed to be an approximately 13-year-old girl and enticed her to send him sexually explicit photos. Mackey sent messages on Discord that were sexual in nature and allegedly planned to meet in person at a hotel near her home. Mackey’s Discord activity also allegedly included messages with an adult woman in which Mackey and the woman discuss their desires to sexually abuse minors.
It is also alleged that Mackey exploited a second victim through hands-on sexual abuse.
If convicted as charged, Mackey could face up to 50 years in prison.
Kyle Rist, 38, of Cincinnati, was also indicted by a federal grand jury on April 30. He is charged with coercion and enticement, 16 counts of sexually exploiting minors, receiving child pornography and possessing child pornography.
According to his charging documents, in September 2023, the grandparents of a teenaged victim alerted law enforcement in Oregon that their granddaughter had been sending and receiving sexually explicit videos of herself and of Rist, who is also known as Jeremy Hadley, through Facebook.
A publicly-filed affidavit details that Rist referred to himself as daddy to the victim and also told the victim they were in a relationship. It is alleged that Rist – pretending to be another man by the name of Jeremy Hadley – had ongoing online discussions with the same teenage victim.
It is alleged that between August and November 2024, Rist sexually exploited a second 7-year-old child in person by producing visual depictions of the victim engaging in and assisting another person in sexually explicit conduct.
If convicted as charged, Rist could face up to life in prison.

New York tax preparer sentenced to two years in prison for submitting fraudulent pandemic relief applications,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/new-york-tax-preparer-sentenced-two-years-prison-submitting,2025-05-09,2025,"RICHMOND, Va. – A New York man was sentenced today to two years in prison for making false statements on loan applications he submitted on behalf of his clients through a pandemic relief program.
According to court documents, Baltej Singh Brar, 42, of South Richmond Hill, New York, owned and operated Aspire Tax & Accounting Services Inc., a tax preparation, accounting, and consulting firm where Brar was an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) registered tax preparer. In 2021, Brar began filing loan applications on behalf of other individuals through the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), a COVID-19 relief program intended to provide loans backed by the Small Business Administration (SBA) to certain businesses, nonprofit organizations, and others to help them remain afloat during the pandemic.
Brar advertised, including on TikTok, that he would file PPP loan applications on behalf of clients in exchange for a flat up-front fee paired with 10% of the loan value after the loan was approved. Brar instructed prospective PPP applicants to provide him with their Social Security number, a copy of their driver’s license, email address, prior bank statements, 2019 tax return, and a void check to be used as supporting documentation on applications.
Most of Brar’s clients were sole proprietors, including taxi drivers, truck drivers, and construction workers. Where clients’ prior year incomes fell below the threshold to receive the maximum PPP loan amount of $20,833, Brar falsely inflated the income amounts in the PPP applications to trigger the maximum loan amount. Brar generated and submitted false and fabricated IRS forms as supporting documentation. Brar certified on each application that the information provided in the applications and supporting documents and forms was “true and accurate in all material respects.”
Many of Brar’s clients were eligible to receive PPP loans, though not in the inflated amounts of the PPP loan applications that Brar prepared. Others were not entitled to receive PPP loans at all. Across the hundreds of PPP loan applications that Brar falsified, Brar caused the SBA at least $550,000 in actual losses.

Former Algona Meatpacking Plant Worker Convicted in Pandemic Benefits Fraud Conspiracy,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/former-algona-meatpacking-plant-worker-convicted-pandemic,2025-05-09,2025,"Co-Schemers Stole Over $2.4 Million
A former Algona, Iowa, meatpacking plant worker who obtained fraudulent Paycheck Protection Program loans and recruited others into the scheme was convicted by a jury on May 8, 2025, after a four-day trial in federal court in Sioux City.
Yovany Ciero, age 48, from Mason City, Iowa, formerly of Cuba, Colombia, and Venezuela, was convicted of three counts of wire fraud, 23 counts of money laundering, one count of engaging in a monetary transaction in property derived from a specified unlawful activity, and one count of money laundering conspiracy.  The verdict was returned following about three and a half hours of jury deliberations.
The evidence at trial showed that Ciero is a former Sergeant in the Cuban military who crossed the Mexican border nearly twenty years ago after his request for a visa to enter the United States was denied.  In 2020, Ciero was working at an Algona meatpacking plant when the COVID-19 pandemic began.  Beginning in July 2020, Ciero, and over one hundred other immigrants from Cuba, obtained fraudulent Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans on the false and fraudulent pretenses that they were self-employed businesspeople who earned approximately $100,000 in gross income in 2019 when they actually worked at the meatpacking plant or elsewhere in 2019.
Ciero was one of six “bundlers” in the fraudulent PPP loan scheme.  Ciero’s role was to recruit individuals into the scheme, obtain their personal identifying information for the fraudulent loan applications, and then pass that information to others who submitted the fraudulent loan applications to lenders who were participating in the PPP.  The evidence established that over $4 million in fraudulent loan PPP applications were submitted, and the government lost over $2.4 million as a result.
Once the individuals received their fraudulent PPP loan funds, typically $20,000 each, Ciero served as a “funnel” in a money laundering conspiracy.  Ciero collected fees that the organizers of the scheme charged the applicants, typically $3,000 per $20,000 fraudulent loan.
Ciero also obtained two fraudulent PPP loans for himself and his paramour.  Ciero used most of this PPP loan money to purchase a semi-truck.  Ciero is the sixth former Iowa meatpacking plant worker convicted in the PPP scheme.
Sentencing before United States District Court Judge Leonard T. Strand will be set after a presentence report is prepared.  Ciero remains free on bond pending sentencing.  Ciero faces a possible maximum sentence of life imprisonment, over $10,000,000 in fines, and three years of supervised release following any imprisonment.
The case is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys Timothy L. Vavricek and Daniel A. Chatham and was investigated by the Small Business Administration - Office of Inspector General, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation - Office of Inspector General, Homeland Security Investigations, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Storm Lake Police Department.

Real Estate Developer Sentenced to More Than Six Years in Prison for Embezzling Millions From the Failed Washington Federal Bank in Chicago,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/real-estate-developer-sentenced-more-six-years-prison-embezzling,2025-04-30,2025,"CHICAGO — A federal judge in Chicago has sentenced a real estate developer to more than six years in prison for participating in a conspiracy that embezzled millions of dollars from the failed Washington Federal Bank for Savings in Chicago.
Washington Federal, which was based in Chicago’s Bridgeport neighborhood, was shut down in 2017 after the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency determined that the bank was insolvent and had at least $66 million in nonperforming loans. For more than a decade, developer MIROSLAW KREJZA was part of a conspiracy that embezzled millions of dollars in bank funds.  The embezzled funds were disguised as purported real estate development loan disbursements to Krejza and others.  The conspirators were not required to repay these purported loans, and they never did.
A federal jury in 2023 convicted Krejza, 67, of Chicago, of conspiring to commit embezzlement and falsify bank records, and aiding and abetting embezzlement by bank employees.  On Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Virginia M. Kendall sentenced Krejza to six years and eight months in prison and ordered him to pay more than $2 million in restitution.
The sentence was announced by Andrew S. Boutros, United States Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois; Vincent R. Zehme, Special Agent-in-Charge of the Chicago Region of the FDIC’s Office of Inspector General; Douglas S. DePodesta, Special Agent-in-Charge of the Chicago Field Office of the FBI; Machelle L. Jindra, Special Agent-in-Charge of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's Office of Inspector General in Chicago; Ramsey E. Covington, Acting Special Agent-in-Charge of IRS Criminal Investigation in Chicago; Korey Brinkman, Special Agent-in-Charge of the Central Region of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, Office of Inspector General; Andrea Peacock, Special Agent-in-Charge of the Department of the Treasury, Office of Inspector General; Deborah Witzburg, City of Chicago Inspector General; and Kathryn B. Richards, Chicago Housing Authority Inspector General.  Valuable assistance was provided by the U.S. Trustee Program.  The government was represented by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Michelle Petersen, Kristin Pinkston, and Jeffrey Snell, and Special Assistant U.S. Attorney Brian Netols.
The federal investigation into the collapse of Washington Federal led to criminal charges against 16 defendants, including the bank’s Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer, and other high-ranking employees, for conspiring to embezzle at least $31 million in bank funds.   Krejza and three others were convicted after jury trials, while ten defendants pleaded guilty and two entered into deferred prosecution agreements.
Much of the embezzled money was transferred to Chicago attorney ROBERT M. KOWALSKI, real estate developer MAREK MATCZUK, and other individuals outside the bank without all of the required documentation and often without any documentation whatsoever.  A jury convicted Robert Kowalski on bankruptcy fraud, bank embezzlement, and tax charges, while Matczuk was convicted of conspiring to commit embezzlement and falsify bank records, as well as aiding and abetting embezzlement by bank employees.  Judge Kendall last year sentenced Robert Kowalski to 25 years in federal prison and Matczuk to nearly 13 years .
Robert Kowalski’s sister, JAN R. KOWALSKI, also an attorney, pleaded guilty and was sentenced to more than three years in prison for fraudulently enabling her brother to conceal more than $357,000 from creditors and the trustee in his bankruptcy case.

The fraud was detected after it occurred, leading to a federal jury conviction in 2023. The investigation, which included multiple federal agencies, revealed the involvement of high-ranking bank employees and resulted in several convictions, with Krejza ordered to pay $1 million in restitution.

Washington Federal, which was based in Chicago’s Bridgeport neighborhood, was shut down in 2017 after the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency determined that the bank was insolvent and had at least $66 million in nonperforming loans. For more than a decade, developer MIROSLAW KREJZA was part of a conspiracy that embezzled millions of dollars in bank funds.  The embezzled funds were disguised as purported real estate development loan disbursements to Krejza and others.  The conspirators were not required to repay these purported loans, and they never did.
A federal jury in 2023 convicted Krejza, 67, of Chicago, of conspiring to commit embezzlement and falsify bank records, and aiding and abetting embezzlement by bank employees.  On Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Virginia M. Kendall sentenced Krejza to six years and eight months in prison and ordered him to pay more than $2 million in restitution.
The sentence was announced by Andrew S. Boutros, United States Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois; Vincent R. Zehme, Special Agent-in-Charge of the Chicago Region of the FDIC’s Office of Inspector General; Douglas S. DePodesta, Special Agent-in-Charge of the Chicago Field Office of the FBI; Machelle L. Jindra, Special Agent-in-Charge of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's Office of Inspector General in Chicago; Ramsey E. Covington, Acting Special Agent-in-Charge of IRS Criminal Investigation in Chicago; Korey Brinkman, Special Agent-in-Charge of the Central Region of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, Office of Inspector General; Andrea Peacock, Special Agent-in-Charge of the Department of the Treasury, Office of Inspector General; Deborah Witzburg, City of Chicago Inspector General; and Kathryn B. Richards, Chicago Housing Authority Inspector General.  Valuable assistance was provided by the U.S. Trustee Program.  The government was represented by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Michelle Petersen, Kristin Pinkston, and Jeffrey Snell, and Special Assistant U.S. Attorney Brian Netols.
The federal investigation into the collapse of Washington Federal led to criminal charges against 16 defendants, including the bank’s Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer, and other high-ranking employees, for conspiring to embezzle at least $31 million in bank funds.   Krejza and three others were convicted after jury trials, while ten defendants pleaded guilty and two entered into deferred prosecution agreements.
Much of the embezzled money was transferred to Chicago attorney ROBERT M. KOWALSKI, real estate developer MAREK MATCZUK, and other individuals outside the bank without all of the required documentation and often without any documentation whatsoever.  A jury convicted Robert Kowalski on bankruptcy fraud, bank embezzlement, and tax charges, while Matczuk was convicted of conspiring to commit embezzlement and falsify bank records, as well as aiding and abetting embezzlement by bank employees.  Judge Kendall last year sentenced Robert Kowalski to 25 years in federal prison and Matczuk to nearly 13 years .
Robert Kowalski’s sister, JAN R. KOWALSKI, also an attorney, pleaded guilty and was sentenced to more than three years in prison for fraudulently enabling her brother to conceal more than $357,000 from creditors and the trustee in his bankruptcy case.
Three former members of Washington Federal’s Board of Directors pleaded guilty to conspiring to falsify bank records to deceive the OCC.  WILLIAM M. MAHON was sentenced to 18 months in prison; GEORGE F. KOZDEMBA was sentenced to a year in prison; and JANICE M. WESTON was sentenced to three months in prison.

Former Monmouth County Resident Sentenced to 16 Years in Prison for Role in Fraudulently Obtaining Over $3.7 Million in Cares Act Loans,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/former-monmouth-county-resident-sentenced-16-years-prison-role,2025-04-29,2025,"NEWARK, N.J. – A former resident of Monmouth County was sentenced to prison for his role in a scheme to fraudulently obtain Payroll Protection Program (PPP) and Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) funds, U.S. Attorney Alina Habba announced.
Kevin Aguilar, age 54, previously of Farmingdale, New Jersey, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Michael A. Shipp in Trenton federal court following Aguilar’s guilty plea to one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud; seven counts of bank fraud; one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud; three counts of wire fraud; one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering; one count of money laundering; and one count of aggravated identity theft. Aguilar was sentenced to 192 months in prison.
According to documents filed in this case and statements made in court:
From April 2020 to April 2021, Aguilar conspired with others to submit seven fraudulent PPP loan applications and three fraudulent EIDL applications on behalf of four businesses. Based on the fraudulent applications, Aguilar received a total of approximately $3.3 million in PPP loan funds and approximately $450,000 in EIDL funds. After receiving the PPP and EIDL funds, Aguilar caused those funds to be transferred to other businesses that he created to give the false appearance that the PPP and EIDL funds were being used for legitimate purposes. Aguilar then used the PPP and EIDL funds to purchase residential properties in Sherman, Texas, a new truck for approximately $100,000, and to pay for other personal expenses.
In addition to the 192-month prison term, Judge Shipp sentenced Aguilar to 5 years of supervised release and ordered him to pay $3,772,567 in restitution, as well as a forfeiture money judgment of $3,772,567.  Judge Shipp also ordered the forfeiture of approximately $1,511,221.62 that law enforcement seized from twelve bank accounts, as well as the three real properties in Sherman, Texas.

Two Defendants Charged In Investment Fraud Scheme With Over One Hundred Victims,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/two-defendants-charged-investment-fraud-scheme-over-one-hundred,2025-08-05,2025,"United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Jay Clayton; Special Agent in Charge of the New York Field Office of Homeland Security Investigations (“HSI”), Ricky J. Patel; Special Agent in Charge of the New York Regional Office of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s Office of the Inspector General (“FDIC-OIG”), Patricia Tarasca; and Acting Inspector in Charge of the New York Division of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service (“USPIS”), Edward Gallashaw, announced today the unsealing of an Indictment charging LOURDES ROSALES BANEGAS and RAMON CONCEPCION with stealing more than one million dollars from over one hundred victims through an investment fraud scheme known as “LNJ Funds.”  BANEGAS is also charged with sending proceeds from the scheme to bank accounts in Colombia.  The defendants were arrested and will be presented today before U.S. Magistrate Judge Robert W. Lehrburger.
“As alleged, Lourdes Rosales Banegas and Ramon Concepcion defrauded over one hundred victims through false promises about high and safe returns on their investments,” said U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton.  “But, Banegas and Concepcion selfishly spent their victims’ money on themselves.  Our office is committed to bringing those who prey on Main Street investors to justice.”
“As alleged, the defendants fleeced over a hundred innocent victims out of millions of dollars through their sham claims of a ‘risk-free’ money-making opportunity,” said HSI Special Agent in Charge Ricky J. Patel.  “Their alleged Ponzi scheme crumbled today, as did any façade of legitimacy behind their purported investment firm, LNJ Funds.  Every day, HSI New York stands alongside our law enforcement partners in utilizing every tool at our disposal to ensure New Yorkers as well as those around the world, and their livelihoods, are protected from criminal opportunists’ intent on filling their pockets by any means necessary.""
“The defendants allegedly made false promises as part of an investment scam involving more than 100 victims and enriched themselves while doing so,” said FDIC-OIG Special Agent in Charge Patricia Tarasca.  “Despite assurances that their victims could eventually recover their invested money, this did not prove to be the case.  We are pleased to join our law enforcement partners in bringing the perpetrators of such deceit to justice.”
“The U.S. Postal Inspection Service will continue to investigate investment schemes such as this and hold those who seek to defraud the American public accountable,” said USPIS Acting Inspector in Charge Edward Gallashaw.  “Before investing, individuals should research all claims and promises of high returns made by investment companies.  Too often, victims are enticed by bold promises and overlook warning signs that something may be off.”
According to allegations in the Indictment: [1]
BANEGAS and CONCEPCION marketed and operated a supposed investment business they called “LNJ Funds.”  BANEGAS and CONCEPCION told their victims that investments in LNJ Funds provided a guaranteed 20% rate of return every sixty days and that there was no risk of losing money in the investment.  BANEGAS and CONCEPCION claimed that LNJ Funds could offer risk-free investments because it invested money in student loans backed by the federal government.  BANEGAS and CONCEPCION also told their investors that they could withdraw their money from LNJ Funds after a waiting period of approximately 60 to 90 days.
Contrary to BANEGAS and CONCEPCION’s promises, LNJ Funds did not invest the money that its prospective investors provided.  Instead, BANEGAS and CONCEPCION spent money from their victim-investors on airfare, hotels, retail stores, and personal expenses.  BANEGAS also sent money to several bank accounts in Colombia, including an account in her name, as well as other accounts under her control.  Additionally, at times money from some LNJ Funds investors was paid to other LNJ Funds investors to perpetuate the myth that LNJ Funds was a legitimate business rather than a scam.
While BANEGAS and CONCEPCION told LNJ Funds investors that they could obtain a return of their invested money after a waiting period, BANEGAS and CONCEPCION did not maintain enough money to repay their investors.  Instead, BANEGAS and CONCEPCION stole and misused the investor money.  Moreover, instead of repaying their investors as promised, BANEGAS, CONCEPCION, and a co-conspirator insulted, ignored, and lied to victims who attempted to withdraw their money from LNJ Funds.
*                *                *
BANEGAS, 43, and CONCEPCION, 43, both of Queens, New York, are each charged with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. BANEGAS is also charged with three counts of engaging in monetary transactions in property derived from specified unlawful activity, each of which carries a maximum of 10 years in prison.
The maximum potential sentences in this case are prescribed by Congress and provided here for informational purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendants will be determined by a judge.
Mr. Clayton praised the outstanding work of HSI, FDIC-OIG, and USPIS.

 -0.00190968]","Lourdes Rosales Banegas and Ramon Concepcion were indicted for orchestrating a $1 million investment fraud scheme known as ""LNJ Funds,"" which defrauded approximately 100 victims through false promises of high, risk-free returns on investments. The scheme was detected after it occurred, leading to their arrest by law enforcement agencies including Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's Office of Inspector General (FDIC-OIG). The detection was facilitated by the investigation into the fraudulent activities and the subsequent indictment unsealed by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York. Key outcomes include the charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, with Banegas facing a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, while Concepcion faces similar charges. The defendants allegedly misused investor funds for personal expenses and perpetuated the scheme by paying earlier investors with new investors' money, ultimately leading to significant financial losses for the victims.","```json

Patel; Special Agent in Charge of the New York Regional Office of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s Office of the Inspector General (“FDIC-OIG”), Patricia Tarasca; and Acting Inspector in Charge of the New York Division of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service (“USPIS”), Edward Gallashaw, announced today the unsealing of an Indictment charging LOURDES ROSALES BANEGAS and RAMON CONCEPCION with stealing more than one million dollars from over one hundred victims through an investment fraud scheme known as “LNJ Funds.”  BANEGAS is also charged with sending proceeds from the scheme to bank accounts in Colombia.  The defendants were arrested and will be presented today before U.S. Magistrate Judge Robert W. Lehrburger.
“As alleged, Lourdes Rosales Banegas and Ramon Concepcion defrauded over one hundred victims through false promises about high and safe returns on their investments,” said U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton.  “But, Banegas and Concepcion selfishly spent their victims’ money on themselves.  Our office is committed to bringing those who prey on Main Street investors to justice.”
“As alleged, the defendants fleeced over a hundred innocent victims out of millions of dollars through their sham claims of a ‘risk-free’ money-making opportunity,” said HSI Special Agent in Charge Ricky J. Patel.  “Their alleged Ponzi scheme crumbled today, as did any façade of legitimacy behind their purported investment firm, LNJ Funds.  Every day, HSI New York stands alongside our law enforcement partners in utilizing every tool at our disposal to ensure New Yorkers as well as those around the world, and their livelihoods, are protected from criminal opportunists’ intent on filling their pockets by any means necessary.""
“The defendants allegedly made false promises as part of an investment scam involving more than 100 victims and enriched themselves while doing so,” said FDIC-OIG Special Agent in Charge Patricia Tarasca.  “Despite assurances that their victims could eventually recover their invested money, this did not prove to be the case.  We are pleased to join our law enforcement partners in bringing the perpetrators of such deceit to justice.”
“The U.S. Postal Inspection Service will continue to investigate investment schemes such as this and hold those who seek to defraud the American public accountable,” said USPIS Acting Inspector in Charge Edward Gallashaw.  “Before investing, individuals should research all claims and promises of high returns made by investment companies.  Too often, victims are enticed by bold promises and overlook warning signs that something may be off.”
According to allegations in the Indictment: [1]
BANEGAS and CONCEPCION marketed and operated a supposed investment business they called “LNJ Funds.”  BANEGAS and CONCEPCION told their victims that investments in LNJ Funds provided a guaranteed 20% rate of return every sixty days and that there was no risk of losing money in the investment.  BANEGAS and CONCEPCION claimed that LNJ Funds could offer risk-free investments because it invested money in student loans backed by the federal government.  BANEGAS and CONCEPCION also told their investors that they could withdraw their money from LNJ Funds after a waiting period of approximately 60 to 90 days.
Contrary to BANEGAS and CONCEPCION’s promises, LNJ Funds did not invest the money that its prospective investors provided.  Instead, BANEGAS and CONCEPCION spent money from their victim-investors on airfare, hotels, retail stores, and personal expenses.  BANEGAS also sent money to several bank accounts in Colombia, including an account in her name, as well as other accounts under her control.  Additionally, at times money from some LNJ Funds investors was paid to other LNJ Funds investors to perpetuate the myth that LNJ Funds was a legitimate business rather than a scam.
While BANEGAS and CONCEPCION told LNJ Funds investors that they could obtain a return of their invested money after a waiting period, BANEGAS and CONCEPCION did not maintain enough money to repay their investors.  Instead, BANEGAS and CONCEPCION stole and misused the investor money.  Moreover, instead of repaying their investors as promised, BANEGAS, CONCEPCION, and a co-conspirator insulted, ignored, and lied to victims who attempted to withdraw their money from LNJ Funds.
*                *                *
BANEGAS, 43, and CONCEPCION, 43, both of Queens, New York, are each charged with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. BANEGAS is also charged with three counts of engaging in monetary transactions in property derived from specified unlawful activity, each of which carries a maximum of 10 years in prison.
The maximum potential sentences in this case are prescribed by Congress and provided here for informational purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendants will be determined by a judge.
Mr. Clayton praised the outstanding work of HSI, FDIC-OIG, and USPIS.

New Jersey Woman Sentenced in Connection With Scheme to Fraudulently Obtain Loans From Small Business Administration,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/new-jersey-woman-sentenced-connection-scheme-fraudulently-obtain,2025-07-25,2025,"Baltimore , Maryland – U.S. District Judge Deborah K. Chasanow sentenced Jennifer Watkins, 48, of Marlton, New Jersey, to 36 months in federal prison, followed by three years of supervised release, in connection with her role as a co-conspirator in a multi-million-dollar bank fraud conspiracy. Watkins and her co-conspirators schemed to fraudulently obtain more than $35 million in Small Business Administration (SBA) loans from financial institutions that they used to purchase hotels. Judge Chasanow also ordered Watkins to pay restitution of $6,010,655.72.
Kelly O. Hayes, U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland, announced the sentence with Special Agent in Charge Robert Manchak, Federal Housing Finance Agency Office of Inspector General (FHFA-OIG), and Special Agent in Charge Jeffrey D. Pittano, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC-OIG) – Mid-Atlantic Region.
According to the factual stipulations in the guilty pleas of Watkins, and co-conspirators Mehul Ramesh Khatiwala, aka “Mike Khatiwala,” 43, of Voorhees, New Jersey, and Rajendra G. Parikh, 64, of Monroe, New Jersey, Khatiwala was the owner and managing member of Delaware Hotel Group LLC (DHG), and an operator of GMK Consulting LLC (GMK) and KPG Hotel Mgmt. LLC (KPG). These LLCs were hotel management and loan broker companies located in Mount Laurel, New Jersey.  Watkins served as a project coordinator for DHG and managing member of Forza Consulting LLC (Forza), a hotel consulting and loan broker company located in Marlton, New Jersey.  Parikh was an owner of KPG.  Co-defendant Rebecca Marie Cohn a/k/a Rebecca Marie Stanton, 38, was a settlement and title processor for Residential Title & Escrow Company, a real estate title company located in Owings Mills, Maryland, that offered escrow and loan-settlement services.
The guilty pleas outline how from August 2018 through February 2020, Khatiwala, Parikh, and Watkins conspired to obtain loan proceeds to buy and sell hotels in connection with a hotel flipping scheme. “Flipping” is a real estate investment strategy that involves purchasing property to hold for a short period before selling it to make a quick profit.  During the SBA-loan application process, the co-conspirators made and caused others to make material misrepresentations and omissions to financial institutions regarding the sellers’ identity, familial relationships between parties, and the nature and amount of the equity injected by the borrowers.  The defendants sought loans through the SBA’s Section 7(a) Program, which guaranteed and insured approximately 75-85 percent of these loans, and required that the small business owner/borrower invest a certain amount of their own money into the business to qualify for the loan.
In their guilty pleas, Khatiwala and Parikh admitted that they acted as managers or supervisors in connection with the scheme.  Additionally, Khatiwala, Parikh, and Watkins admitted that they created shell companies using co-conspirators as straw owners of the entities.  These straw owners had no actual ownership interest in the entities as Khatiwala and Parikh were the true owners.  The straw owners signed purchase contracts, operating agreements, and related documents to buy hotel properties in the name of the shell companies.
Co-conspirators then created a second company to purchase the hotels from the shell companies at substantially higher prices.  After the co-conspirators formed the companies to control both sides of the flip transaction, they solicited banks for small-business loans to finance the buying company’s purchase of the hotel from the straw companies.  The co-conspirators helped the buying companies qualify for the loans by falsely representing investors’ equity injections to the banks, among other materially false statements, misrepresentations, and omissions.  The financial institutions extending the loans relied on the false statements and misrepresentations.
U.S. Attorney Hayes commended the FHFA-OIG and FDIC-OIG for their work in the investigation.  Ms. Hayes also thanked Assistant U.S. Attorneys Harry M. Gruber, Evelyn L. Cusson, and Ari D. Evans, who are prosecuting the federal case, and recognized Paralegal Specialist Joanna B.N. Huber, who provided legal support for the case.

Merryday has sentenced Edward Jenkinson (47, Trinity) to 11 months in federal prison for theft, embezzlement, or misapplication of funds by a bank officer. As part of his sentence, the court also entered an order of forfeiture in the amount of $122,000, the proceeds of the charged criminal conduct. Jenkinson pleaded guilty on April 8, 2025.
According to court documents, Jenkinson was employed as a bank officer at a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insured institution. As a bank officer, Jenkinson was responsible for managing a financial center located in Tampa. One of Jenkinson’s duties was to oversee the Automated Teller Machine (ATM) and teller cash drawers at the financial center.
Between March and November 2024, Jenkinson embezzled FDIC-insured funds. As part of his embezzlement scheme, Jenkinson redeemed certificates of deposit without customers’ knowledge or consent. He then prepared deposit tickets and deposited the redeemed funds in customer checking accounts. Subsequently, Jenkinson embezzled the funds from the victim customers’ accounts and drafted cashiers’ checks payable to himself, which he deposited into his own bank accounts. Jenkinson depleted most of the embezzled funds through cash withdrawals. Jenkinson also embezzled $52,000 from the ATM at the financial center he managed and spent the funds on gambling, paying off debts, and retail purchases.
This case was investigated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation – Office of Inspector General and the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office. It was prosecuted by Special Assistant United States Attorney Chris Poor.

Former bank insider pleads guilty to stealing money from customer accounts,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/former-bank-insider-pleads-guilty-stealing-money-customer,2025-07-22,2025,"RICHMOND, Va. – A South Chesterfield woman pled guilty today to embezzling funds from and making false statements to her former employer, Truist Financial Corporation.
According to court documents, Ahshah Dior Martin, 35, repeatedly stole customer banking information to enrich herself.
In 2023, Martin began improperly using her access to Truist computer systems to gather Truist account holders’ banking information. Then, she initiated fraudulent debits and withdrawals from these accounts for her own benefit. For instance, Martin repeatedly initiated payments from customer bank accounts to a child support payment processor, through which Martin paid herself. In all, Martin used her access to sensitive customer financial information to steal $195,000 from at least 70 separate Truist customer accounts.
Martin stole from the Truist accounts of individuals and entities, including multiple churches, a children’s museum, an eye tissue bank non-profit organization, manufacturing and construction companies, a small business making customized holsters, and the North Carolina Wing of the Civil Air Patrol. Martin spent stolen funds on cosmetic products, clothing, travel expenses, dining, and at a hookah bar.
On April 15, 2024, Martin was terminated by Truist. Despite repeated attempts to retrieve her Truist laptop, Martin retained access to her work computer. To conceal her wrongdoing and prevent the return of her Truist laptop, Martin faked her own death. On April 17, 2024, in response to an email from Truist asking for the computer, Martin responded, “Sorry to inform you, she has passed away.”
Martin is scheduled to be sentenced on Nov. 20 and faces up to 30 years in prison. Actual sentences for federal crimes are typically less than the maximum penalties. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.
Erik S. Siebert, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, and Jeffrey D. Pittano, Special Agent in Charge of the Mid-Atlantic Region for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC-OIG), made the announcement after U.S. District Judge Roderick C. Young accepted the plea.

According to court documents, Ahshah Dior Martin, 35, repeatedly stole customer banking information to enrich herself.
In 2023, Martin began improperly using her access to Truist computer systems to gather Truist account holders’ banking information. Then, she initiated fraudulent debits and withdrawals from these accounts for her own benefit. For instance, Martin repeatedly initiated payments from customer bank accounts to a child support payment processor, through which Martin paid herself. In all, Martin used her access to sensitive customer financial information to steal $195,000 from at least 70 separate Truist customer accounts.
Martin stole from the Truist accounts of individuals and entities, including multiple churches, a children’s museum, an eye tissue bank non-profit organization, manufacturing and construction companies, a small business making customized holsters, and the North Carolina Wing of the Civil Air Patrol. Martin spent stolen funds on cosmetic products, clothing, travel expenses, dining, and at a hookah bar.
On April 15, 2024, Martin was terminated by Truist. Despite repeated attempts to retrieve her Truist laptop, Martin retained access to her work computer. To conceal her wrongdoing and prevent the return of her Truist laptop, Martin faked her own death. On April 17, 2024, in response to an email from Truist asking for the computer, Martin responded, “Sorry to inform you, she has passed away.”
Martin is scheduled to be sentenced on Nov. 20 and faces up to 30 years in prison. Actual sentences for federal crimes are typically less than the maximum penalties. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.
Erik S. Siebert, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, and Jeffrey D. Pittano, Special Agent in Charge of the Mid-Atlantic Region for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC-OIG), made the announcement after U.S. District Judge Roderick C.

Missouri City resident admits to profiting $1.65 million from fraudulent pandemic loan applications,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/missouri-city-resident-admits-profiting-165-million-fraudulent,2025-07-21,2025,"HOUSTON – A 42-year-old man has pleaded guilty to a wire fraud conspiracy involving the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) and Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) program, announced U.S. Attorney Nicholas J. Ganjei.
Shawn Nicholas Young applied for PPP and EIDL loans on behalf of his own businesses as well as businesses belonging to others. The Small Business Administration (SBA) administered the loan programs he targeted, which were intended to help existing small businesses survive the COVID-19 pandemic.
To qualify for funding, Young misrepresented key information about the businesses. He supported the false statements with fake tax returns and backdated documents.
Over the conspiracy, Young submitted more than 100 fraudulent applications, requesting more than $9.5 million in funds earmarked for pandemic relief. He received kickbacks from co-conspirators who were approved for loans.
Young profited $1.65 million from the conspiracy. He used the proceeds for personal expenses, such as paying off his mortgage and buying a car. As part of his plea, Young will pay full restitution to the victims of his crimes and forfeit his house and car.
U.S. District Judge Kenneth M. Hoyt will sentence Young Oct. 27. At that time, Young faces up to 20 years in federal prison and a possible $250,000 maximum fine.
He was permitted to remain on bond pending that hearing.

Marston to 65 months in prison, three years of supervised release, and a $3,100 special assessment for stealing the personal information of multiple U.S. servicemembers and using it to inflict emotional distress, and related offenses.
The defendant was charged by indictment in January 2024, pleading guilty in July of last year to one count of conspiracy to commit identity theft, seven counts of misuse of a Social Security number, one count of aggravated identity theft, 21 counts of false statements, and one count of cyberstalking.
As detailed in court filings and admitted to by the defendant, from February 2018 to March 2021, Mayhue, who served in the United States Army with his victims, stole and used their personally identifiable information to harass and stalk them over past grievances he had with them in the military.
Mayhue and unknown co-conspirators impersonated the victims and conducted numerous unauthorized transactions with banks, credit unions, the Federal Trade Commission, and other entities, including terminating their military and disability benefits, rerouting direct deposit payments, changing account information such as email addresses, physical addresses and phone numbers, and reporting their debit cards as stolen. In addition, Mayhue cyberstalked one victim, claiming he was surveilling her and subjecting her to sexual threats.
“Investigating individuals who hold positions of trust and misuse Department of Defense (DoD) information is a priority for the DoD Office of Inspector General’s Defense Criminal Investigative Service (DCIS),” stated Acting Special Agent in Charge Christopher Silvestro, DCIS Northeast Field Office. “Today’s sentencing demonstrates our commitment to work with our law enforcement partners and the Department of Justice to protect our nation’s service members.”
“Today’s sentencing holds Mr. Mayhue accountable for his role in an account takeover scheme that targeted members of the U.S. Army by using their personally identifiable information to impersonate them and conduct unauthorized transactions with various entities,” said Special Agent in Charge Jason Scalzo of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC OIG), Electronic Crimes Unit. “The FDIC OIG will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to investigate such schemes that harm consumers and threaten to undermine the safety and soundness of our nation’s banking system.”

"Texas Company Guilty of Aiding and Abetting Fraudulent Transactions Related to False Ethanol Sales, Pays Over $15,000,000 in Fines, Restitution",https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/texas-company-guilty-aiding-and-abetting-fraudulent-transactions,2025-07-11,2025,"NEW ORLEANS –Acting United States Attorney Michael M. Simpson announced today the June 10, 2025, guilty plea and sentencing of Plano, Texas-based MUREX MANAGEMENT, INC. (“ MMI ”), for aiding and abetting transactions that defrauded financial institutions, including failed New Orleans-based First NBC Bank.  U.S. District Judge Carl J. Barbier sentenced MMI to pay $15,745,846.10 in fines and restitution, a sum that MMI paid on the day of sentencing as part of its plea agreement in this case.
According to court documents, MMI was the management company and affiliate of Murex LLC, a privately-owned ethanol marketing and logistics company.  Another company, named as “Company A” in court records, was the U.S.-based subsidiary of a separate, foreign publicly traded company that operated ethanol production plants.
Beginning in 2013, Company A and its parent companies, began to experience financial stress.  In order to ameliorate cash flow issues and to manufacture additional financing for its debts, Company A initiated a strategy called “buy/sells” and approached MMI to assist in this strategy.  Company A’s plan called for Company A and MMI , through its affiliate, to create fictitious invoices purporting to be sales of ethanol between the two companies, which could then be sold as accounts receivable to unwitting buyers via a New Orleans-based online marketplace.  This strategy would provide cash flow for Company A and a profit to MMI . Although these invoices purported to show the bona fide sale of ethanol between MMI and Company A, in fact, no ethanol was exchanged between the companies through these transactions.  The unwitting buyers of these fraudulent accounts receivable included FDIC-insured financial institutions like First NBC Bank.
In plea documents, MMI admitted that, between October 28, 2013, and September 18, 2015, Company A and MMI conducted approximately $1.2 billion in fraudulent “buy/sell” transactions, with MMI making a profit of approximately $6,073,049.  Company A eventually defaulted on paying financial institutions for the accounts receivable that had been posted for auction by MMI .  The defaulted auctions caused a loss of approximately $73,073,683.05 to First NBC Bank, and a loss of approximately $8,330,427.02 to a North Carolina-based bank.
As part of MMI’s plea agreement, it agreed to a fine of $6,073,049.24.  Furthermore, MMI agreed as part of its plea to pay $4,263,145.30 in restitution to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as Receiver for First NBC Bank, as well as $5,409,651.56 to the successor of the North Carolina-based bank that also purchased the false accounts receivables. MMI was also ordered to pay a $400.00 mandatory special assessment fee.
“The conclusion of this case sends a clear message”, said Acting U.S. Attorney Michael M. Simpson.  “Entities that engage in fraudulent schemes to manipulate and damage the security of our nation's banking system will be held accountable.  Along with our federal, state and local investigative partners, our office will continue to investigate and prosecute financial corruption-wherever it may be uncovered in the Eastern District of Louisiana”.
“The FDIC OIG is pleased to join our law enforcement partners in announcing today’s guilty plea, and we remain committed to investigating and holding accountable corporate offenders who defraud our insured financial institutions and cause harm to our nation’s banking industry,” said Robert De Los Santos, Acting Special Agent in Charge, Dallas Region, Office of Inspector General for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
“The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Criminal Investigation Division is proud to have played a key role in this collaborative effort, which resulted in more than $15 million in restitution and penalties,” said Special Agent in Charge Kimberly Bahney of EPA’s Southwest Branch.  “Working alongside the FDIC OIG and our law enforcement partners, we remain committed to holding accountable those who defraud the government and undermine the integrity of the renewable fuels program.”
Acting U.S. Attorney Simpson praised the work of the FDIC Office of Inspector General, Dallas Field Office, and the Environmental Protection Agency, Criminal Investigation Division, Houston Resident Office, that investigated this matter.  Assistant United States Attorneys Matthew R. Payne of the Financial Crimes Unit and Nicholas D. Moses, Healthcare Fraud Coordinator, handled this prosecution.

Simpson announced today the June 10, 2025, guilty plea and sentencing of Plano, Texas-based MUREX MANAGEMENT, INC. (“ MMI ”), for aiding and abetting transactions that defrauded financial institutions, including failed New Orleans-based First NBC Bank.  U.S. District Judge Carl J. Barbier sentenced MMI to pay $15,745,846.10 in fines and restitution, a sum that MMI paid on the day of sentencing as part of its plea agreement in this case.
According to court documents, MMI was the management company and affiliate of Murex LLC, a privately-owned ethanol marketing and logistics company.  Another company, named as “Company A” in court records, was the U.S.-based subsidiary of a separate, foreign publicly traded company that operated ethanol production plants.
Beginning in 2013, Company A and its parent companies, began to experience financial stress.  In order to ameliorate cash flow issues and to manufacture additional financing for its debts, Company A initiated a strategy called “buy/sells” and approached MMI to assist in this strategy.  Company A’s plan called for Company A and MMI , through its affiliate, to create fictitious invoices purporting to be sales of ethanol between the two companies, which could then be sold as accounts receivable to unwitting buyers via a New Orleans-based online marketplace.  This strategy would provide cash flow for Company A and a profit to MMI . Although these invoices purported to show the bona fide sale of ethanol between MMI and Company A, in fact, no ethanol was exchanged between the companies through these transactions.  The unwitting buyers of these fraudulent accounts receivable included FDIC-insured financial institutions like First NBC Bank.
In plea documents, MMI admitted that, between October 28, 2013, and September 18, 2015, Company A and MMI conducted approximately $1.2 billion in fraudulent “buy/sell” transactions, with MMI making a profit of approximately $6,073,049.  Company A eventually defaulted on paying financial institutions for the accounts receivable that had been posted for auction by MMI .  The defaulted auctions caused a loss of approximately $73,073,683.05 to First NBC Bank, and a loss of approximately $8,330,427.02 to a North Carolina-based bank.
As part of MMI’s plea agreement, it agreed to a fine of $6,073,049.24.  Furthermore, MMI agreed as part of its plea to pay $4,263,145.30 in restitution to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as Receiver for First NBC Bank, as well as $5,409,651.56 to the successor of the North Carolina-based bank that also purchased the false accounts receivables. MMI was also ordered to pay a $400.00 mandatory special assessment fee.
“The conclusion of this case sends a clear message”, said Acting U.S. Attorney Michael M. Simpson.  “Entities that engage in fraudulent schemes to manipulate and damage the security of our nation's banking system will be held accountable.  Along with our federal, state and local investigative partners, our office will continue to investigate and prosecute financial corruption-wherever it may be uncovered in the Eastern District of Louisiana”.
“The FDIC OIG is pleased to join our law enforcement partners in announcing today’s guilty plea, and we remain committed to investigating and holding accountable corporate offenders who defraud our insured financial institutions and cause harm to our nation’s banking industry,” said Robert De Los Santos, Acting Special Agent in Charge, Dallas Region, Office of Inspector General for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
“The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Criminal Investigation Division is proud to have played a key role in this collaborative effort, which resulted in more than $15 million in restitution and penalties,” said Special Agent in Charge Kimberly Bahney of EPA’s Southwest Branch.  “Working alongside the FDIC OIG and our law enforcement partners, we remain committed to holding accountable those who defraud the government and undermine the integrity of the renewable fuels program.”
Acting U.S. Attorney Simpson praised the work of the FDIC Office of Inspector General, Dallas Field Office, and the Environmental Protection Agency, Criminal Investigation Division, Houston Resident Office, that investigated this matter.  Assistant United States Attorneys Matthew R. Payne of the Financial Crimes Unit and Nicholas D. Moses, Healthcare Fraud Coordinator, handled this prosecution.

Ponte Vedra Beach Man Pleads Guilty In Fraud Scheme Involving COVID-19 Personal Protective Equipment,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/ponte-vedra-beach-man-pleads-guilty-fraud-scheme-involving-covid,2025-07-10,2025,"Jacksonville, Florida – United States Attorney Gregory W. Kehoe announces that James Elliott Davis, II (36, Ponte Vedra Beach) has pleaded guilty to bank fraud, wire fraud, money laundering, and theft of mail. Davis faces up to 30 years in federal prison on the bank fraud count, up to 20 years in prison on the wire fraud count, up to 10 years in prison on the money laundering count, up to 5 years in prison on the theft of mail count and payment of restitution to the victims he defrauded. Davis has agreed to forfeit between $6.7 and $8.8 million, which are traceable to proceeds of the crimes he committed. No sentencing date has been set.
According to court documents, from March 2018 through 2022, Davis ran a purported medical supply company named Medisale Inc. Using false representations, Davis enticed individuals and business entities to invest large sums of money in Medisale. He falsely represented to victim-investors that Medisale was making significant profits on the sale of COVID-19 Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). He claimed to have contact with CEOs at various hospitals and that Medisale had contracts with hospitals to sell large volumes of N95 masks and other PPE. In convincing victim-investors to give him money, Davis showed fraudulent bank statements with large balances, claiming the money was from the sale of PPE.
In reality, Medisale had no such contracts and had no true revenue from the sale of PPE. Instead, Davis kited checks and conducted fraudulent ACH/wire transfers between multiple financial institutions in order to artificially inflate the apparent balances on his bank accounts. Utilizing victim-investor funds, Davis paid off previous debts, paid other investors purported profits from the sale of PPE, and paid personal expenses. This included Davis using victim-investor money to purchase a membership at a luxury club in Ponte Vedra Beach and spending more than $27,000 on custom clothing.
This case was investigated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation - Office of Inspector General, Florida Department of Law Enforcement, and the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation. It is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Kevin C. Frein. The asset forfeiture is being handled by Assistant United States Attorney Jennifer M. Harrington.

Suarez was initially indicted in September 2023 but resided in Panama City, Panama at the time. In January 2025, Suarez was arrested in Panama and brought to South Florida to face the charges.
According to court documents, in March 2022 Suarez explained to a confidential informant that he had access to the bank of account of an elderly victim, who was 82 years old at the time.  To carry out the fraud conspiracy, Suarez created and mailed fraudulent checks from Panama to South Florida with directions to cash the checks and return 50% of the fraud proceeds to Suarez by wiring the money to Suarez’s Miami-based company, Online Electronics.  The fraudulent checks contained forged signatures designed to resemble that of the victim’s signature on his/her signature card for that same bank account.
In total, Suarez and his co-conspirators stole approximately $803,000 from the elderly victim’s bank account during a four-month period.
Sentencing is set for September 29, 2025, in Miami before United States District Court Judge Kathleen M. Williams.  Suarez pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud and mail fraud (Count 1) and one count of aggravated identity theft (Count 4). Suarez faces up to 30 years in prison on Count 1, and an additional mandatory two years in prison, to run consecutive to any term of imprisonment imposed on Count 1.

WASHINGTON – Crissy Monique Baker, 45, a federal employee from Fairfax, Virginia, pleaded guilty today in U.S. District Court to making false, fictitious, or fraudulent claims in connection with claiming to work more hours for the government than she actually did.
The plea was announced by U.S. Attorney Jeanine Ferris Pirro, Acting Inspector General Stephen Ravas of AmeriCorps Office of Inspector General, FBI Assistant Director in Chief Steven J. Jensen of the Washington Field Office, and Acting Special Agent in Charge Michael Smith with the Department of U.S. Housing and Urban Development, Office of Inspector General.
Between October 2021 and May 2025, Baker worked as a management and program analyst for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. According to court documents, from October 2021 through July 2024, Baker held multiple full-time government contractor positions to perform human resources services for other federal agencies but did not seek approval from HUD to engage in this outside employment. Through this years-long scheme, Baker billed the government more than 24 hours in a single day between her employment with the federal government and contractors. The estimated loss to the government was $225,866.
Between September 2021 through April 2023, Contractor-A employed Baker to perform full-time work as a human resources assistant for AmeriCorps. From May 16, 2022, until Dec. 2, 2022, Contractor-B employed Baker to work full-time as a human resources specialist for the National Institutes of Health.
Because of her scheme, Baker willfully caused the contractors to submit false claims to the U.S. Government for hours that she did not actually work. In addition, Baker submitted timesheets to HUD certifying that she worked hours for the government agency that she never actually did. For example, in June 2022, Baker certified through timesheets to HUD, Contractor-A, and Contractor-B, that she worked 26 hours per day on 13 workdays out of a total of 21 workdays that month.
Since Baker teleworked in all three positions, she was able to conceal her employment with HUD and the two contractors from each other.
U.S. District Court Judge Sparkle L. Sooknanan scheduled sentencing for Sept. 30, 2025.
This case was investigated by the Offices of the Inspector General for the following agencies:  AmeriCorps; Housing and Urban Development; the Department of Energy; the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation; the Department of Homeland Security; the General Services Administration; the Department of Health and Human Services; and the Department of Treasury (Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration), the Department of Defense (Defense Criminal Investigate Service), and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, along with the FBI Washington Field Office.

Nicaraguan National Extradited from Spain for International Extortion and Wire Fraud Scheme,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/nicaraguan-national-extradited-spain-international-extortion-and,2025-06-17,2025,"MIAMI – Ernesto Ortega Padgett, a Nicaraguan national who was previously residing in Miami, FL and was deported from the United States in January 2020, made his initial appearance in a federal court in Miami on June 16. Ortega, a fugitive wanted in the United States, Spain, and Panama, was extradited from Madrid, Spain, to Miami to face federal charges related to an international wire fraud, extortion, and money laundering conspiracy that resulted in more than $29 million in losses to victims located across the United States.
Ortega, 41, is charged in a 27-count indictment returned by a federal grand jury on Feb. 2, 2023. The charges include:
Conspiracy to Commit Wire Fraud,
Wire Fraud,
Conspiracy to Commit Hobbs Act Extortion,
Conspiracy to Commit Money Laundering,
Making a Communication in Interstate Commerce Containing a Threat to Injure,
Engaging in Transactions Involving Criminally Derived Property, and
Conspiracy to Transport Stolen Property
According to the indictment, Ortega’s criminal scheme began in 2020 and targeted businesses across the United States. Ortega and his co-conspirators posed as bank representatives and used a combination of technology and social engineering to deceive victims into providing sensitive account information. Ortega and his co-conspirators then used that information to access victims’ bank accounts and initiate unauthorized wire transfers.
Ortega relied on an international network of money launderers to receive the stolen funds, withdraw them in cash, and forward the proceeds to accounts directly under Ortega’s control, often in the form of cryptocurrency. During commission of the scheme, Ortega and his co-conspirators used extortion, threatened force, and fear of injury to compel some money launderers to take part in the scheme.
Ortega conducted the scheme spanning multiple countries and continents, which resulted in losses exceeding $29 million.
Ortega had also been charged in Spain for related criminal conduct before fleeing that jurisdiction, as well as having pending charges in Panama. He remained a fugitive for nearly a year, with active warrants in all three countries. In December 2023, law enforcement received intelligence that Ortega would be traveling to Paris, France, for Christmas. Law enforcement subsequently intercepted Ortega, who was apprehended at the Charles de Gaulle International Airport in Paris. Ortega was then extradited back to Madrid pursuant to a European Union fugitive warrant, where he remained until extradited to the United States on June 13, pursuant to an indictment issued by the Southern District of Florida.
If convicted, Ortega faces up to 20 years in prison on the conspiracy to commit wire fraud charge, up to 20 years in prison on the wire fraud charge, up to 20 years in prison on the Hobbs Act charge, up to 20 years in prison on the conspiracy to commit money laundering charge, up to 20 years in prison on the making a communication in interstate commerce containing a threat to injure charge, up to 10 years in prison for the engaging in transactions involving criminally derived property charge, and up to five years in prison for the conspiracy to transport stolen property. Each count also carries the possibility of a fine and supervised release upon completion of any prison sentence. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.
U.S. Attorney Hayden P. O’Byrne for the Southern District of Florida; Special Agent in Charge Jason Scalzo of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC-OIG) Electronic Crimes Unit; and Special Agent in Charge Rafael Barros of the US Secret Service (USSS), Miami Field Office, made the announcement.
FDIC-OIG and the U.S. Secret Service are investigating the case. The Justice Department’s Office of International Affairs provided significant assistance in securing Ortega’s arrest and extradition.  The United States also thanks the Government of Spain, French authorities, the USSS Madrid Resident Office, and the USSS Paris Field Office for their valuable assistance.

Former Orange County Supervisor Sentenced to 5 Years in Prison for Bribery Scheme Involving More Than $10 Million in COVID Funds,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/former-orange-county-supervisor-sentenced-5-years-prison-bribery,2025-06-09,2025,"SANTA ANA, California – A former politician who served on the Orange County Board of Supervisors was sentenced today to 60 months in federal prison for accepting more than $550,000 in bribes for directing and voting in favor of more than $10 million in COVID-19 pandemic relief funds to a charity affiliated with one of his daughters.
Andrew Hoang Do, 62, of Santa Ana, was sentenced by United States District Judge James V. Selna, who scheduled a restitution hearing for August 11.
Do pleaded guilty in October 2024 to one count of conspiracy to commit bribery concerning programs receiving federal funds.
“Elected officials have a sworn duty to put their constituents’ interests ahead of their own,” said United States Attorney Bill Essayli. “Public money intended to assist aging and ailing pandemic victims instead filled the coffers of Do, his family, and insiders. I commend our prosecutors and law enforcement partners for their work on this important case and for helping to remove a corrupt politician from his seat of power.”
“As a county supervisor, Andrew Do transformed the County of Orange into an ATM available to his insiders, his loved ones, and himself, withdrawing millions of dollars to buy houses, lavish dinners, and expensive wine while the elderly, the sick, and the vulnerable who depended on Andrew Do were left to fend for themselves,” said Orange County District Attorney Todd Spitzer. “We, along with our federal partners, are continuing to peel back the layers of conspiracy to hold every thief accountable and return those stolen monies to the communities to which they belonged.”
“Mr. Do abused his powerful position as a county supervisor to profit personally at the expense of individuals in need, as well as the residents of Orange County, who deserve honest leadership,” said Akil Davis, the Assistant Director in Charge of the FBI's Los Angeles Field Office. “The FBI will continue to pursue corrupt public officials whose actions erode trust in government.”
From February 2015 until his resignation in October 2024, Do was one of five supervisors on the Orange County Board of Supervisors, which is responsible for the county’s $9 billion annual budget. As supervisor for the First District, Do represented the cities of Cypress, Fountain Valley, Garden Grove, Huntington Beach, La Palma, Los Alamitos, Midway City, Rossmoor, Seal Beach, and Westminster.
Beginning in 2020, in exchange for more than $550,000 in bribes, Do voted in favor of and directed millions of dollars in COVID-related funds to the Viet America Society (VAS), a charity affiliated with his daughter. Do directed and worked together with other county employees to approve contracts with – and payments to – VAS. Do further admitted he acted corruptly and abused his position of trust as a county supervisor.
Shortly after receiving the COVID-related public funds from the county government – funds that were intended to provide meals to the elderly and disabled – VAS from April 2021 to February 2024 paid a business identified in court documents as “Company #1” $100,000 or more per month, which totaled approximately $3,804,000. In September 2021, VAS increased its payments to Company #1 from $100,000 to $108,000 per month. Company #1 then began paying Rhiannon Do – Do’s daughter – $8,000 per month, totaling by February 2024 approximately $224,000.
In addition to the $8,000 monthly payments that Company #1 had made to Do’s daughter, in July 2023, Company #1 also transferred a total of $381,500 from the funds it had received from VAS to an escrow company. In July 2023, Do’s daughter used the escrow account funds to purchase a home, in her name, in Tustin for $1,035,000. As part of that transaction, a mortgage for more than $600,000 was obtained by a loan application that contained false information and with fabricated documents. Do’s daughter has admitted in court documents that her conduct was criminal and violated federal and state law.
The $381,500 from Company #1 that his daughter used to purchase the Tustin house in 2023 was a disguised bribe to Do. An additional $100,000 in payments sent to his other daughter, including three $25,000 checks from Company #2 – an air conditioning company that had been paid by VAS – also were bribes to Do.
Some of the bribe funds that had been funneled to his daughters were spent for his direct benefit. For example, during 2022, a total of $14,849 of funds that had been funneled to Do’s daughters was used to make property tax payments for properties in Orange County owned by Do and his wife. Approximately $15,000 was used to pay for one of Do’s credit card bills.
Do knew that VAS was not providing all the meals for which the county had paid VAS. Instead, much of the funds were used for the benefit of insiders, including to buy real estate in the name of both Do’s daughter and Company #1, bribe payments to both of Do’s daughters, payments to other conspirators, payments to other companies affiliated with VAS’s listed officers, and through hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash withdrawals.
Do forfeited assets connected to the bribery scheme, including the Tustin property his daughter purchased in 2023. As part of his daughter’s related diversion agreement, she forfeited the Tustin property. The plea agreement requires Do to pay full restitution, including the bribe money he and his daughters received. In August 2024, the government seized more than $2.4 million from VAS’s and Company #1’s bank accounts.
Do resigned from the Orange County Board of Supervisors as part of a related agreement with the Orange County District Attorney’s Office (OCDA). He also agreed to forfeit any pension credit for the time where he participated in the bribery conspiracy.
The FBI; the Orange County District Attorney’s Office Bureau of Investigation; the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Office of the Inspector General; IRS Criminal Investigation; and the United States Department of Education Office of the Inspector General investigated this matter.
This matter is being jointly prosecuted by the United States Attorney’s Office and OCDA. The prosecution is being led by Assistant United States Attorneys Nandor F.R. Kiss, Rosalind Wang, and Tara Vavere of the United States Attorney’s Office and Senior Deputy District Attorney Avery T. Harrison and Deputy District Attorney Anthony J. Schlehner of the OCDA.
Any member of the public who has information related to this or any other public corruption matter in Orange County is encouraged to send information to the FBI’s email tip line at https://tips.fbi.gov and/or to contact the FBI’s Los Angeles Field Office at (310) 477-6565.

```",True,bribery,Insider Fraud,Government Benefits Fraud,Law Enforcement Investigation,"Santa Ana, California","$550,000",550000.0,"SANTA ANA, California – A former politician who served on the Orange County Board of Supervisors was sentenced today to 60 months in federal prison for accepting more than $550,000 in bribes for directing and voting in favor of more than $10 million in COVID-19 pandemic relief funds to a charity affiliated with one of his daughters.
Andrew Hoang Do, 62, of Santa Ana, was sentenced by United States District Judge James V. Selna, who scheduled a restitution hearing for August 11.
Do pleaded guilty in October 2024 to one count of conspiracy to commit bribery concerning programs receiving federal funds.
“Elected officials have a sworn duty to put their constituents’ interests ahead of their own,” said United States Attorney Bill Essayli. “Public money intended to assist aging and ailing pandemic victims instead filled the coffers of Do, his family, and insiders. I commend our prosecutors and law enforcement partners for their work on this important case and for helping to remove a corrupt politician from his seat of power.”
“As a county supervisor, Andrew Do transformed the County of Orange into an ATM available to his insiders, his loved ones, and himself, withdrawing millions of dollars to buy houses, lavish dinners, and expensive wine while the elderly, the sick, and the vulnerable who depended on Andrew Do were left to fend for themselves,” said Orange County District Attorney Todd Spitzer. “We, along with our federal partners, are continuing to peel back the layers of conspiracy to hold every thief accountable and return those stolen monies to the communities to which they belonged.”
“Mr. Do abused his powerful position as a county supervisor to profit personally at the expense of individuals in need, as well as the residents of Orange County, who deserve honest leadership,” said Akil Davis, the Assistant Director in Charge of the FBI's Los Angeles Field Office. “The FBI will continue to pursue corrupt public officials whose actions erode trust in government.”
From February 2015 until his resignation in October 2024, Do was one of five supervisors on the Orange County Board of Supervisors, which is responsible for the county’s $9 billion annual budget. As supervisor for the First District, Do represented the cities of Cypress, Fountain Valley, Garden Grove, Huntington Beach, La Palma, Los Alamitos, Midway City, Rossmoor, Seal Beach, and Westminster.
Beginning in 2020, in exchange for more than $550,000 in bribes, Do voted in favor of and directed millions of dollars in COVID-related funds to the Viet America Society (VAS), a charity affiliated with his daughter. Do directed and worked together with other county employees to approve contracts with – and payments to – VAS. Do further admitted he acted corruptly and abused his position of trust as a county supervisor.
Shortly after receiving the COVID-related public funds from the county government – funds that were intended to provide meals to the elderly and disabled – VAS from April 2021 to February 2024 paid a business identified in court documents as “Company #1” $100,000 or more per month, which totaled approximately $3,804,000. In September 2021, VAS increased its payments to Company #1 from $100,000 to $108,000 per month. Company #1 then began paying Rhiannon Do – Do’s daughter – $8,000 per month, totaling by February 2024 approximately $224,000.
In addition to the $8,000 monthly payments that Company #1 had made to Do’s daughter, in July 2023, Company #1 also transferred a total of $381,500 from the funds it had received from VAS to an escrow company. In July 2023, Do’s daughter used the escrow account funds to purchase a home, in her name, in Tustin for $1,035,000. As part of that transaction, a mortgage for more than $600,000 was obtained by a loan application that contained false information and with fabricated documents. Do’s daughter has admitted in court documents that her conduct was criminal and violated federal and state law.
The $381,500 from Company #1 that his daughter used to purchase the Tustin house in 2023 was a disguised bribe to Do. An additional $100,000 in payments sent to his other daughter, including three $25,000 checks from Company #2 – an air conditioning company that had been paid by VAS – also were bribes to Do.
Some of the bribe funds that had been funneled to his daughters were spent for his direct benefit. For example, during 2022, a total of $14,849 of funds that had been funneled to Do’s daughters was used to make property tax payments for properties in Orange County owned by Do and his wife. Approximately $15,000 was used to pay for one of Do’s credit card bills.
Do knew that VAS was not providing all the meals for which the county had paid VAS. Instead, much of the funds were used for the benefit of insiders, including to buy real estate in the name of both Do’s daughter and Company #1, bribe payments to both of Do’s daughters, payments to other conspirators, payments to other companies affiliated with VAS’s listed officers, and through hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash withdrawals.
Do forfeited assets connected to the bribery scheme, including the Tustin property his daughter purchased in 2023. As part of his daughter’s related diversion agreement, she forfeited the Tustin property. The plea agreement requires Do to pay full restitution, including the bribe money he and his daughters received. In August 2024, the government seized more than $2.4 million from VAS’s and Company #1’s bank accounts.
Do resigned from the Orange County Board of Supervisors as part of a related agreement with the Orange County District Attorney’s Office (OCDA). He also agreed to forfeit any pension credit for the time where he participated in the bribery conspiracy.
The FBI; the Orange County District Attorney’s Office Bureau of Investigation; the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Office of the Inspector General; IRS Criminal Investigation; and the United States Department of Education Office of the Inspector General investigated this matter.
This matter is being jointly prosecuted by the United States Attorney’s Office and OCDA. The prosecution is being led by Assistant United States Attorneys Nandor F.R. Kiss, Rosalind Wang, and Tara Vavere of the United States Attorney’s Office and Senior Deputy District Attorney Avery T. Harrison and Deputy District Attorney Anthony J. Schlehner of the OCDA.

Founder of O.C.-Based Non-Profit Charged in 15-Count Indictment Alleging He Bribed County Supervisor in $12 Million Scheme,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/founder-oc-based-non-profit-charged-15-count-indictment-alleging,2025-06-06,2025,"SANTA ANA, California – The founder of a now-shuttered non-profit organization has been indicted on federal charges alleging he bribed then-Orange County Supervisor Andrew Hoang Do to obtain approximately $12 million in COVID-19 pandemic-related funds, pocketed the bulk of that money, then laundered it to avoid detection by law enforcement, the Justice Department announced today.
Peter Anh Pham, 65, of Garden Grove, is charged with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, one count of conspiracy to commit honest services wire fraud, six counts of wire fraud, six counts of concealment money laundering, and one count of bribery.
Also charged in the indictment is Thanh Huong Nguyen, 61, of Santa Ana, who is charged with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, one count of wire fraud, and one count of concealment money laundering.
Pham is considered to be a fugitive from justice. Nguyen’s initial appearance and arraignment are expected to occur on Monday in U.S. District Court in Santa Ana.
“These two defendants are charged with conspiring with a corrupt politician to pad their pockets while the nation suffered under the weight of COVID-19,” said United States Attorney Bill Essayli. “My office and our law enforcement partners will continue our efforts to prosecute individuals who cashed in on government aid intended to help those impacted by the largest public health emergency in a century.”
“This conspiracy was a house of cards built on lies, betrayal, and insatiable greed,” said Orange County District Attorney Todd Spitzer. “Today’s indictments are another critical step in ensuring accountability – and consequences – for those who conspired to use the County of Orange’s COVID-19 funds as their personal ATMs – and to return those stolen funds to their rightful owners – the community for which these funds were originally intended.”
According to the indictment that was returned on Wednesday and unsealed today, Pham was a friend and associate of Do, 62, of Santa Ana, who served on the Orange County Board of Supervisors from 2015 until his resignation in October 2024. In that role, Do was one of five supervisors on the Board, which is responsible for the county’s $9 billion annual budget.
Do pleaded guilty in October 2024 to one count of conspiracy to commit bribery concerning programs receiving federal funds and is scheduled to be sentenced on June 9, when he will face a sentence of up to five years in federal prison.
From June 2020 to October 2024, Do used his official position as a county supervisor to vote for millions of dollars in county funds to be allocated in his district, subject to disbursement at his sole discretion. Do then steered county contracts and grants to Pham and Nguyen, the indictment alleges.
For example, in June 2020, Do voted to approve an agenda item that, in part, allocated $5 million in federal COVID-19 pandemic-relief funding to a county nutrition program. As part of this agenda item, Do authorized himself a budget of $1 million to develop that nutrition program in his district, which he could distribute without further approval from the rest of the Board. Eight days after Do voted to approve the agenda item, Pham founded the Huntington Beach-based non-profit organization Viet America Society (VAS).
Pham, through VAS, and Nguyen, through a Garden Grove-based group called Hand-to-Hand Relief Organization Inc. (H2H), entered into contracts and beneficiary agreements with the county. In many of these contracts, VAS and H2H falsely represented that they would reimburse the county for any funds not spent for the contract’s intended purpose. In each of the beneficiary agreements, VAS and H2H falsely certified that all funds would be used solely for the grant’s intended purpose.
In exchange for Pham’s bribes in the form of payments to his two daughters, Do used his official position as a county supervisor to advocate for VAS and H2H so county employees would approve contracts and beneficiary agreements between the county and these organizations. Do and his staff – including his chief of staff – edited the terms of those contracts and agreements to make them more favorable to Pham and Nguyen. Through the influence of Do and his staff, the county wired funds to Pham and Nguyen.
After receiving county funds, Pham and Nguyen transferred most of the money to other entities they controlled. They then spent large portions of the funds to pay personal expenses such as rent and bills, to pay off debts owed by their other businesses, and to make personal investments such as purchasing commercial and residential real estate. Pham and Nguyen also used county funds to bribe Do through payments to his daughters.
Pham also used county money to pay the eventual wife of Do’s chief of staff, under the guise that she was providing consulting services to VAS. Do’s chief of staff then used his position in Orange County’s government to help VAS and H2H obtain county contracts, edited the contracts’ terms to make them more favorable to VAS and H2H, and helped those organizations fulfill reporting requirements and get paid.
When required to submit invoices to the county to account for how the money was being spent, Pham and Nguyen submitted false documents, claiming to have used all the funds – all solely for legitimate purposes and according to the contracts’ terms.
To disguise the funds’ source, Pham and an associate caused checks from county funds to be written to a Westminster-based company called D Air Conditioning Co. LLC. This company then issued checks from its corporate bank account to Pham, Pham’s associate, and one of Do’s daughters.
In total, Pham and Nguyen unlawfully acquired approximately $12 million in county funds through this conspiracy.
An indictment contains allegations that a defendant has committed a crime.  Every defendant is presumed innocent until and unless proved guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
If convicted of the charges, Pham and Nguyen would face a statutory maximum sentence of 20 years in federal prison for the conspiracy count, each wire fraud count, and each money laundering count. Pham also would face up to 10 years in federal prison for the bribery count.
The FBI, the Orange County District Attorney’s Office Bureau of Investigation, and IRS Criminal Investigation are investigating this matter.
Assistant United States Attorneys Nandor F.R. Kiss and Rosalind Wang of the Orange County Office, Assistant United States Attorney Tara Vavere of the Asset Forfeiture and Recovery Section, and Senior Deputy District Attorney Avery T.

Par Funding Principal and Former CFO Sentenced to 66 Months in Prison for Racketeering Conspiracy,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/par-funding-principal-and-former-cfo-sentenced-66-months-prison,2025-06-02,2025,"PHILADELPHIA – United States Attorney David Metcalf announced that Joseph Cole Barleta, 41, of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, was sentenced today by United States District Court Judge Mark A. Kearney to 66 months’ imprisonment, three years’ supervised release, $302,700,484.60 in restitution, and forfeiture of $8,063,303.83, for racketeering conspiracy (RICO), in connection with his role in the operation of a fraudulent investment vehicle known as Complete Business Solutions Group Inc. d/b/a Par Funding (“Par Funding”).
Barleta was charged by second superseding indictment in February of 2024 and pleaded guilty to the RICO charge in October.
As detailed in court filings and admitted to by the defendant, Barleta and co-defendants Joseph LaForte, James LaForte, and others, were part of an association-in-fact RICO enterprise that conspired to commit a number of predicate crimes, including crimes related to the fleecing of Par Funding’s many investors.
Barleta’s role in the conspiracy related to helping financially engineer the securities and wire fraud components of the enterprise at the direction of Joseph LaForte. In particular, Barleta manipulated financial statements, fudged numbers, and cooked the internal books of Par Funding in order to deceive investors into thinking that Par Funding was profitable and successful, when the business was actually losing significant amounts year after year.
In January 2025, the Court found the Par Funding fraud scheme caused an actual fraud loss of approximately $404,000,000, which it reduced to $288,395,088 after factoring in credit for collateral that federal authorities seized from Par Funding when the investigation became public in July 2020, upon the SEC placing Par Funding in receivership.
Joe LaForte and James LaForte pleaded guilty last year to racketeering conspiracy, securities fraud, and related crimes. In March, Joe LaForte was sentenced to 15½ years in prison and James LaForte to 11½ years in prison.
“Barleta played a key role in the massive fraud scheme that was Par Funding,” said U.S. Attorney Metcalf. “He participated in an extensive and destructive conspiracy that inflicted substantial harm on the community. My office will continue to prosecute perpetrators of these complex financial crimes and vindicate the victims who lose their hard-earned money to them.”
“This sentencing holds Joseph Barleta accountable for his criminal actions, including securities and wire fraud,” said Wayne A. Jacobs, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI’s Philadelphia Division. “The FBI, together with our partners, remains unwavering in our commitment to identify, investigate, and disrupt complex financial crimes, ensuring that those who perpetrate them are brought to justice.”
“Mr. Barleta was brought to justice today for his role in the operation of a fraudulent investment vehicle that deceived Par Funding’s numerous investors and caused them significant financial losses,” said Patricia Tarasca, Special Agent in Charge of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC OIG), New York Region. “The FDIC OIG will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to investigate and hold accountable those who participate in fraudulent schemes such as these, that harm investors and threaten the safety and soundness of our Nation’s financial system.”
This case was investigated by the FBI, FDIC OIG, IRS Criminal Investigation, and the Pennsylvania State Police and is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys Matthew Newcomer, Samuel Dalke, and Eric Gill. The SEC in Florida investigated and litigated the civil securities fraud charges, which formed the basis of a portion of the criminal prosecution.

As detailed in court filings and admitted to by the defendant, Barleta and co-defendants Joseph LaForte, James LaForte, and others, were part of an association-in-fact RICO enterprise that conspired to commit a number of predicate crimes, including crimes related to the fleecing of Par Funding’s many investors.
Barleta’s role in the conspiracy related to helping financially engineer the securities and wire fraud components of the enterprise at the direction of Joseph LaForte. In particular, Barleta manipulated financial statements, fudged numbers, and cooked the internal books of Par Funding in order to deceive investors into thinking that Par Funding was profitable and successful, when the business was actually losing significant amounts year after year.
In January 2025, the Court found the Par Funding fraud scheme caused an actual fraud loss of approximately $404,000,000, which it reduced to $288,395,088 after factoring in credit for collateral that federal authorities seized from Par Funding when the investigation became public in July 2020, upon the SEC placing Par Funding in receivership.
Joe LaForte and James LaForte pleaded guilty last year to racketeering conspiracy, securities fraud, and related crimes. In March, Joe LaForte was sentenced to 15½ years in prison and James LaForte to 11½ years in prison.
“Barleta played a key role in the massive fraud scheme that was Par Funding,” said U.S. Attorney Metcalf. “He participated in an extensive and destructive conspiracy that inflicted substantial harm on the community. My office will continue to prosecute perpetrators of these complex financial crimes and vindicate the victims who lose their hard-earned money to them.”
“This sentencing holds Joseph Barleta accountable for his criminal actions, including securities and wire fraud,” said Wayne A. Jacobs, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI’s Philadelphia Division. “The FBI, together with our partners, remains unwavering in our commitment to identify, investigate, and disrupt complex financial crimes, ensuring that those who perpetrate them are brought to justice.”
“Mr. Barleta was brought to justice today for his role in the operation of a fraudulent investment vehicle that deceived Par Funding’s numerous investors and caused them significant financial losses,” said Patricia Tarasca, Special Agent in Charge of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC OIG), New York Region. “The FDIC OIG will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to investigate and hold accountable those who participate in fraudulent schemes such as these, that harm investors and threaten the safety and soundness of our Nation’s financial system.”
This case was investigated by the FBI, FDIC OIG, IRS Criminal Investigation, and the Pennsylvania State Police and is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys Matthew Newcomer, Samuel Dalke, and Eric Gill. The SEC in Florida investigated and litigated the civil securities fraud charges, which formed the basis of a portion of the criminal prosecution.

Former Exec at O.C. Company and Illegal Alien Arrested on Federal Complaint Alleging He Embezzled $7 Million from His Employer,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/former-exec-oc-company-and-illegal-alien-arrested-federal,2025-05-22,2025,"SANTA ANA, California – A former executive at a Newport Beach company that specializes in the purchase of classic cars – who also happens to be an illegal alien from Mexico – was arrested today on a federal complaint alleging he embezzled approximately $7 million from his employer.
Alexander G. Ramos, 62, of Newport Beach, is charged with wire fraud, a felony that carries a statutory maximum sentence of 20 years in federal prison.
A federal magistrate judge ordered Ramos jailed without bond and scheduled an arraignment for June 30.
According to an affidavit filed with the complaint, Ramos was employed at the victim company since 2017 until his termination in September 2024 in the company’s Risk Management Department. Through his positions, he knew his employer’s loans and held relationships with title agents or other partners nationwide. He also oversaw requests by the company’s Title and Risk Department to its Accounting Department for payment to title agents, sometimes submitting the requests himself.
Ramos allegedly caused checks to be issued from the victim company to certain parties, including a Las Vegas DMV services business. The checks were supposed to cover expenses for tax, titling, and licensing associated with car purchases.
However, Ramos purposely caused his employer to send too much money to the outside entities. He then directed those entities on how to dispose of the extra money, including by sending the funds to bank accounts that he controlled.
A law enforcement review of financial records revealed that approximately $7 million in checks and wires were deposited into Ramos-controlled bank accounts from the outside entities in the car industry. The origin of some of the funds deposited into Ramos’s bank accounts showed the checks and wires were made out to the victim company and were intended as refunds to that company’s clients who had overpaid for vehicle registration fees.
Instead of being returned directly to the Ramos’s employer, Ramos allegedly moved the funds to other accounts he controlled for his personal use, including buying a home in Irvine. The illegal transfers date back to at least January 2020, according to the complaint.
Ramos is an illegal alien from Mexico who was removed from the United States in 2017 but later returned.

Former Bank of O’Fallon executive pleads guilty to swindling $2 million in check kiting fraud scheme,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/former-bank-ofallon-executive-pleads-guilty-swindling-2-million,2025-05-20,2025,"EAST ST. LOUIS, Ill. – The former second-in-command of the Bank of O’Fallon appeared in federal court Monday to admit to charges for engaging in a fraud scheme to obtain more than $2 million.
Andrew P. Blassie, 69, of St. Louis, pleaded guilty to one count of bank fraud and one count of interstate transportation of security or funds obtained by fraud.
“This conviction, secured shortly after Blassie’s April 8 indictment, reflects the investigators’ outstanding work and the Bank of O’Fallon’s vital cooperation to dismantle the scheme. This result delivers swift justice for O’Fallon’s residents and protects the integrity of our financial system,” said U.S. Attorney Steven D. Weinhoeft. “He must face a serious consequence for betraying his clients, employer, family, and community.”
According to the indictment, Blassie served as the Executive Vice President for the Bank of O’Fallon and defrauded the bank out of $1,972,887.67 in a check kite scheme from September 2023 through September 2024 during his employment.
Blassie admitted to falsely inflating the balance of his personal checking account at the Bank of O’Fallon by depositing checks he knew to be backed by non-sufficient funds. He deposited checks with non-sufficient funds from four personal accounts at three other banks and one credit union into the Bank of O’Fallon account.
“The level of corruption the defendant in this case achieved was beyond shameful. Rather than serve the Bank of O’Fallon and its customers, the defendant chose to serve himself – to more than $2 million. His guilty plea today should send a message to others who would seek to rip off their unsuspecting customers that they will be caught, and they will be held accountable,” Resident Agent in Charge Michael Kurzeja, of the U.S. Secret Service Springfield Office said. “I thank all of our Federal, state and local partners who helped in the successful prosecution of this former bank executive.”
Blassie paid nearly $2.7 million for personal expenses from the falsely inflated account thus using funds belonging to the Bank of O’Fallon. As the former Executive Vice President, Blassie used his position to conceal his fraud from the Bank of O’Fallon by scrubbing his name and account number from the suspected kiting reports.
“This former bank executive abused his position of trust and the trust of the community for personal enrichment,” said Special Agent in Charge Vincent R. Zehme, of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC OIG), Chicago Region. “The FDIC OIG is pleased to join our law enforcement partners in announcing today’s guilty plea, and we remain committed to investigating and holding bank insiders who commit fraud accountable, as we seek to preserve the integrity of our Nation’s banking system and to protect depositors and financial consumers.”
From August 2022 through September 2024, Blassie also persuaded a couple from Lebanon, Illinois, to give him $489,000 of their retirement savings. In return for this investment, Blassie gave the couple two promissory notes. He agreed to pay the couple interest on the notes and used money he obtained through his check kite scheme to pay some of that interest.
As security for his promissory notes, Blassie pledged 128 of his and his wife’s shares of the holding company which owns the Bank of O’Fallon.
“Andrew Blassie abused his position of trust as a bank executive by committing fraud for his own personal gain and has now been brought to justice for his actions,” said Jon Ellwanger, Special Agent in Charge, Western Region, Office of Inspector General for the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. “We are proud to have worked with our law enforcement partners to achieve this plea agreement.”
According to the indictment, Blassie later sold most of these shares and did not use those funds to repay the Lebanon couple. This left the couple with no means of recourse when Blassie later defaulted on the promissory notes.
“The Federal Housing Finance Agency, Office of Inspector General (FHFA-OIG) is committed to investigating allegations of fraud involving bank officials who abuse their position of public trust and financial institutions, particularly the Federal Home Loan Banks,” said Korey Brinkman, Special Agent in Charge of the FHFA-OIG’s Central Region. “We are proud to have partnered with the U.S. Secret Service, FDIC OIG, FRB OIG, and the O’Fallon (IL) Police Department on this case.”
Officials with the Bank of O’Fallon have fully cooperated with law enforcement during the investigation. Blassie’s sentencing is scheduled for 10:30 a.m. on Sept. 18 at the federal courthouse in East St. Louis.

He engaged in a check kiting scheme, inflating his personal checking account balance by depositing checks that were backed by insufficient funds. The fraud was detected after it occurred, with the investigation aided by the cooperation of Bank of O'Fallon and various law enforcement agencies, including the Secret Service and the FDIC Office of Inspector General. As a result of his guilty plea, Blassie faces serious consequences, including sentencing scheduled for September 30, and has already repaid funds to victims, including a couple from Lebanon, Illinois, whom he defrauded of $489,000.

```",True,bank fraud and check kiting scheme,Internal Banking Misconduct Fraud,Loan Fraud,Law Enforcement Investigation,"O'Fallon, IL","$1,972,887",1972887.0,"EAST ST. LOUIS, Ill. – The former second-in-command of the Bank of O’Fallon appeared in federal court Monday to admit to charges for engaging in a fraud scheme to obtain more than $2 million.
Andrew P. Blassie, 69, of St. Louis, pleaded guilty to one count of bank fraud and one count of interstate transportation of security or funds obtained by fraud.
“This conviction, secured shortly after Blassie’s April 8 indictment, reflects the investigators’ outstanding work and the Bank of O’Fallon’s vital cooperation to dismantle the scheme. This result delivers swift justice for O’Fallon’s residents and protects the integrity of our financial system,” said U.S. Attorney Steven D. Weinhoeft. “He must face a serious consequence for betraying his clients, employer, family, and community.”
According to the indictment, Blassie served as the Executive Vice President for the Bank of O’Fallon and defrauded the bank out of $1,972,887.67 in a check kite scheme from September 2023 through September 2024 during his employment.
Blassie admitted to falsely inflating the balance of his personal checking account at the Bank of O’Fallon by depositing checks he knew to be backed by non-sufficient funds. He deposited checks with non-sufficient funds from four personal accounts at three other banks and one credit union into the Bank of O’Fallon account.
“The level of corruption the defendant in this case achieved was beyond shameful. Rather than serve the Bank of O’Fallon and its customers, the defendant chose to serve himself – to more than $2 million. His guilty plea today should send a message to others who would seek to rip off their unsuspecting customers that they will be caught, and they will be held accountable,” Resident Agent in Charge Michael Kurzeja, of the U.S. Secret Service Springfield Office said. “I thank all of our Federal, state and local partners who helped in the successful prosecution of this former bank executive.”
Blassie paid nearly $2.7 million for personal expenses from the falsely inflated account thus using funds belonging to the Bank of O’Fallon. As the former Executive Vice President, Blassie used his position to conceal his fraud from the Bank of O’Fallon by scrubbing his name and account number from the suspected kiting reports.
“This former bank executive abused his position of trust and the trust of the community for personal enrichment,” said Special Agent in Charge Vincent R. Zehme, of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC OIG), Chicago Region. “The FDIC OIG is pleased to join our law enforcement partners in announcing today’s guilty plea, and we remain committed to investigating and holding bank insiders who commit fraud accountable, as we seek to preserve the integrity of our Nation’s banking system and to protect depositors and financial consumers.”
From August 2022 through September 2024, Blassie also persuaded a couple from Lebanon, Illinois, to give him $489,000 of their retirement savings. In return for this investment, Blassie gave the couple two promissory notes. He agreed to pay the couple interest on the notes and used money he obtained through his check kite scheme to pay some of that interest.
As security for his promissory notes, Blassie pledged 128 of his and his wife’s shares of the holding company which owns the Bank of O’Fallon.
“Andrew Blassie abused his position of trust as a bank executive by committing fraud for his own personal gain and has now been brought to justice for his actions,” said Jon Ellwanger, Special Agent in Charge, Western Region, Office of Inspector General for the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. “We are proud to have worked with our law enforcement partners to achieve this plea agreement.”
According to the indictment, Blassie later sold most of these shares and did not use those funds to repay the Lebanon couple. This left the couple with no means of recourse when Blassie later defaulted on the promissory notes.
“The Federal Housing Finance Agency, Office of Inspector General (FHFA-OIG) is committed to investigating allegations of fraud involving bank officials who abuse their position of public trust and financial institutions, particularly the Federal Home Loan Banks,” said Korey Brinkman, Special Agent in Charge of the FHFA-OIG’s Central Region. “We are proud to have partnered with the U.S. Secret Service, FDIC OIG, FRB OIG, and the O’Fallon (IL) Police Department on this case.”
Officials with the Bank of O’Fallon have fully cooperated with law enforcement during the investigation. Blassie’s sentencing is scheduled for 10:30 a.m. on Sept. 18 at the federal courthouse in East St. Louis.
The O’Fallon Police Department, U.S. Secret Service, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General, the Office of Inspector General for the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and the Federal Housing Finance Agency, Office of Inspector General made contributions to the investigation.

Santa Barbara County Investment Advisor Sentenced to Over 10 Years in Prison for Stealing Nearly $2.3 Million From Elderly Clients,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/santa-barbara-county-investment-advisor-sentenced-over-10-years,2025-05-19,2025,"LOS ANGELES – A Santa Barbara County investment advisor was sentenced today to 121 months in federal prison for stealing approximately $2.25 million from elderly clients of her investment advisory business, including clients that were receiving end-of-life care.
Julie Anne Darrah, 52, of Santa Maria, was sentenced by United States District Judge Otis D. Wright II, who will schedule a restitution hearing at a later date.
Darrah pleaded guilty on March 4 to one count of wire fraud.
During the scheme, Darrah stole approximately $2.25 million from her firm’s clients. She did so by obtaining control of her victims’ assets, and then – without the victims’ knowledge or consent – she liquidated their security holdings and transferred the proceeds to accounts she controlled. As part of this, she convinced victims to sign documents making her the trustee of their trusts or a signatory on their bank accounts or giving her power of attorney over their brokerage accounts and allowing her – as their investment advisor – to transfer funds from their accounts to other bank accounts, including to her own accounts.
Darrah took advantage of trust victims placed in her – often convincing them she would take care of them in their older years like a daughter, and she used this trust to convince them to sign the documents that she then used to steal money from them. In this way, Darrah stole money from victims from approximately November 2016 to July 2023. She used stolen funds to buy properties for herself, pay other personal expenses, buy luxury vehicles, and operate other business ventures. Some victims were left in desperate circumstances, without the money to pay for end-of-life care, when the fraud was discovered.
Darrah also convinced a company identified in the plea agreement as “Business Victim 1,” a Minnesota-based investment advisor firm, to acquire VFM based on false and misleading statements and the concealment of material facts, including not telling that firm about her theft of individual client funds. After the fraud was discovered, Business Victim 1 incurred approximately $5.4 million in losses.
In October 2023, the SEC filed a civil complaint against Darrah in connection with this scheme. In December 2024, United States District Judge Dale S. Fischer found Darrah liable to pay $2,416,511, including interest.
The FBI and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General investigated this matter.
Assistant United States Attorney Kerry L. Quinn of the Major Frauds Section prosecuted this case.

Maryland Settlement Processor Pleads Guilty to Submitting False Settlement Statements to Financial Institutions,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/maryland-settlement-processor-pleads-guilty-submitting-false,2025-04-14,2025,"Baltimore, Maryland – Rebecca Marie Cohn, aka Rebecca Marie Stanton, 38, of Fallston, Maryland, pled guilty in federal court to knowingly and willfully making false statements to financial institutions in connection with real-estate settlements.
Kelly O. Hayes, U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland, announced the guilty plea with Special Agent in Charge Robert Manchak, Federal Housing Finance Agency Office of Inspector General (FHFA-OIG), and Special Agent in Charge Jeffrey D. Pittano, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC-OIG), Mid-Atlantic Region.
From 2013 through 2019, Cohn worked as a settlement and title processor for Residential Title & Escrow Company, a real estate title company located in Owings Mills, Maryland.  As part of her job handling real estate property settlements, Cohn created, reviewed, and submitted HUD-1 Settlement Statements to financial institutions.  Cohn was also responsible for documenting incoming funds and disbursements in connection with real-estate closings, along with providing financial institutions with documentation of equity injections utilized in real-estate transactions.
At Residential, Cohn engaged in settlement work in connection with co-defendants Mehul Ramesh Khatiwala, aka “Mike Khatiwala,” 43, of Voorhees, New Jersey, Rajendra G. Parikh, 64, of Monroe, New Jersey, Jennifer H. Watkins, 48, of Marlton, New Jersey, and entities associated with them.  Khatiwala, Parikh, and Watkins recently pled guilty to a conspiracy to obtain loan proceeds to buy and sell hotels in connection with a hotel-flipping scheme.
“Flipping” is a real-estate investment strategy that involves purchasing property to hold for a short period before selling it to make a quick profit.  Khatiwala, Parikh, and Watkins created limited liability companies with no significant business activity (“shell entities” or “selling entities”) to purchase hotel properties.  They then created a second company to purchase the hotels from the shell companies at substantially higher prices.  Cohn performed settlement work for the second part of the flip transaction.
Khatiwala, Parikh, and Watkins sought loans for those transactions through the SBA’s Section 7(a) Program, which guaranteed and insured approximately 75-85 percent of these loans, and required that the small business owner/borrower invest a certain amount of their own money into the business to qualify for the loan.
From June 2019 until August 2019, Cohn worked with Khatiwala, Watkins, and Parikh, handling settlement transactions that she knew the information represented on the HUD-1 Settlement Statements was materially false. Cohn also made false statements to financial institutions by sending them information about buyers’ equity injections in the form of checks, bank records, and other documents.
Through these false statements Cohn claimed to show that various equity injections occurred, knowing that those funds had already been represented as used for a previous real-estate hotel settlement.  Cohn knew that the financial institutions relied on the false statements to decide to extend the loans to the borrowing entities.
On July 23, 2019, Cohn knowingly submitted a materially false HUD-1 Settlement Statement in connection with an SBA guaranteed loan to North State Bank. The statement substantially overrepresented the deposit or earnest money that the borrowing entity actually utilized in the transaction.
Additionally, in the statement she provided for the loan settlement, she falsely claimed that the settlement took place on July 23, 2019. But the settlement could not have taken place on that date because the selling entity did not own the hotel until July 24, 2019.  Cohn knew that the selling entity did not own the hotel on July 23, 2019, as she used the loan proceeds provided by North State Bank to help the selling entity purchase the hotel.
Cohn is facing a maximum sentence of 30 years in federal prison for making false statements to a financial institution.  Actual sentences for federal crimes are typically less than the maximum penalties.  A federal district court judge determines sentencing after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.
U.S. Attorney Hayes commended the FHFA-OIG and FDIC-OIG for their work in the investigation.  Ms. Hayes also thanked Assistant U.S. Attorneys Harry M. Gruber, Evelyn L. Cusson, and Ari D.

```",True,making false statement to a financial institution,Loan Fraud,Account Manipulation Fraud,Audit,"Owings Mill, Maryland",Unknown,,"Baltimore, Maryland – Rebecca Marie Cohn, aka Rebecca Marie Stanton, 38, of Fallston, Maryland, pled guilty in federal court to knowingly and willfully making false statements to financial institutions in connection with real-estate settlements.
Kelly O. Hayes, U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland, announced the guilty plea with Special Agent in Charge Robert Manchak, Federal Housing Finance Agency Office of Inspector General (FHFA-OIG), and Special Agent in Charge Jeffrey D. Pittano, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC-OIG), Mid-Atlantic Region.
From 2013 through 2019, Cohn worked as a settlement and title processor for Residential Title & Escrow Company, a real estate title company located in Owings Mills, Maryland.  As part of her job handling real estate property settlements, Cohn created, reviewed, and submitted HUD-1 Settlement Statements to financial institutions.  Cohn was also responsible for documenting incoming funds and disbursements in connection with real-estate closings, along with providing financial institutions with documentation of equity injections utilized in real-estate transactions.
At Residential, Cohn engaged in settlement work in connection with co-defendants Mehul Ramesh Khatiwala, aka “Mike Khatiwala,” 43, of Voorhees, New Jersey, Rajendra G. Parikh, 64, of Monroe, New Jersey, Jennifer H. Watkins, 48, of Marlton, New Jersey, and entities associated with them.  Khatiwala, Parikh, and Watkins recently pled guilty to a conspiracy to obtain loan proceeds to buy and sell hotels in connection with a hotel-flipping scheme.
“Flipping” is a real-estate investment strategy that involves purchasing property to hold for a short period before selling it to make a quick profit.  Khatiwala, Parikh, and Watkins created limited liability companies with no significant business activity (“shell entities” or “selling entities”) to purchase hotel properties.  They then created a second company to purchase the hotels from the shell companies at substantially higher prices.  Cohn performed settlement work for the second part of the flip transaction.
Khatiwala, Parikh, and Watkins sought loans for those transactions through the SBA’s Section 7(a) Program, which guaranteed and insured approximately 75-85 percent of these loans, and required that the small business owner/borrower invest a certain amount of their own money into the business to qualify for the loan.
From June 2019 until August 2019, Cohn worked with Khatiwala, Watkins, and Parikh, handling settlement transactions that she knew the information represented on the HUD-1 Settlement Statements was materially false. Cohn also made false statements to financial institutions by sending them information about buyers’ equity injections in the form of checks, bank records, and other documents.
Through these false statements Cohn claimed to show that various equity injections occurred, knowing that those funds had already been represented as used for a previous real-estate hotel settlement.  Cohn knew that the financial institutions relied on the false statements to decide to extend the loans to the borrowing entities.
On July 23, 2019, Cohn knowingly submitted a materially false HUD-1 Settlement Statement in connection with an SBA guaranteed loan to North State Bank. The statement substantially overrepresented the deposit or earnest money that the borrowing entity actually utilized in the transaction.
Additionally, in the statement she provided for the loan settlement, she falsely claimed that the settlement took place on July 23, 2019. But the settlement could not have taken place on that date because the selling entity did not own the hotel until July 24, 2019.  Cohn knew that the selling entity did not own the hotel on July 23, 2019, as she used the loan proceeds provided by North State Bank to help the selling entity purchase the hotel.
Cohn is facing a maximum sentence of 30 years in federal prison for making false statements to a financial institution.  Actual sentences for federal crimes are typically less than the maximum penalties.  A federal district court judge determines sentencing after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.
U.S. Attorney Hayes commended the FHFA-OIG and FDIC-OIG for their work in the investigation.  Ms. Hayes also thanked Assistant U.S. Attorneys Harry M. Gruber, Evelyn L. Cusson, and Ari D. Evans, who are prosecuting the federal case, and recognized Paralegal Specialists Joanna B.N. Huber and Zharde Todman.

Jenkinson has also agreed to forfeit to the United States $122,004.04, the proceeds of his criminal activity. A sentencing date has not yet been set.
According to the plea agreement and court proceedings, Jenkinson was employed as a bank officer at Bank 1, an FDIC insured institution that was a member bank of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta.

He then prepared deposit tickets and deposited the redeemed funds in customer checking accounts. Subsequently, Jenkinson embezzled the funds from the victim customers’ accounts and drafted cashiers’ checks payable to himself, which he deposited into his own bank accounts. Jenkinson depleted most of the embezzled funds through cash withdrawals.  He also embezzled $52,000 from the ATM machine at the Bank 1 financial center he managed in Tampa, as well as $2,500 from a bank teller drawer. Jenkinson spent the embezzled funds on gambling, paying off debt, and retail purchases.
This case was investigated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation – Office of Inspector General and the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office. It is being prosecuted by Special Assistant United States Attorney Chris Poor.

Former Bank of O’Fallon executive indicted for $2 million fraud scheme,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/former-bank-ofallon-executive-indicted-2-million-fraud-scheme,2025-04-09,2025,"EAST ST. LOUIS, Ill. – A federal grand jury in southern Illinois charged the former second-in-command of the Bank of O’Fallon for engaging in a fraud scheme to obtain more than $2 million.
Andrew P. Blassie, 69, of St. Louis, is facing one count of bank fraud and one count of interstate transportation of security or funds obtained by fraud.
“Senior bank officials must act as fiduciaries, not felons—they must serve the bank, not swindle it,” said U.S. Attorney Steven D. Weinhoeft. “The federal justice system leads the fight against corruption in all its forms, and the allegations in this case—a $2 million check kiting scheme and a $500,000 investor rip-off—are glaring examples of the type of financial betrayal that will not be tolerated. We commend the Bank of O’Fallon for their cooperation with the investigation, which has been vital to ensuring both that justice is served, and that the integrity of the financial system is preserved.”
According to the indictment, Blassie served as the Executive Vice President for the Bank of O’Fallon and is charged with defrauding the bank out of $1,972,887.67 in a check kite scheme from September 2023 through September 2024 during his employment.
Blassie is accused of falsely inflating the balance of his personal checking account at the Bank of O’Fallon by depositing checks he knew to be backed by non-sufficient funds. He allegedly deposited checks with non-sufficient funds from four personal accounts at three other banks and one credit union into the Bank of O’Fallon account.
“Bank fraud is a serious crime that has real victims. It’s worsened when someone in a position of trust violates that authority, as the defendant is alleged to have done in this case to a staggering degree,” Resident Agent in Charge Michael Kurzeja, of the U.S. Secret Service Springfield Resident Office said. “The U.S. Secret Service takes very seriously its duty to protect the nation’s financial infrastructure. I’m proud of our agents’ work to dismantle the scheme in this case. I am thankful for the work of our Federal, state, and local partners who helped in this case.”
The indictment alleges Blassie paid nearly $2.7 million for personal expenses from the falsely inflated account thus using funds belonging to the Bank of O’Fallon. As the former Executive Vice President, Blassie is accused of using his position to conceal his fraud from the Bank of O’Fallon by scrubbing his name and account number from the suspected kiting reports.
“This indictment charges a former bank executive for allegedly engaging in a check kiting scheme that fraudulently obtained funds from the Bank of O’Fallon,” said Special Agent in Charge Vincent R. Zehme, of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC OIG), Chicago Region. “The FDIC OIG remains committed to working with our law enforcement partners to investigate allegations of fraud by bank insiders, as we seek to preserve the integrity of our Nation’s banking system and to protect depositors and financial consumers.”
From August 2022 through September 2024, Blassie is also accused of persuading a couple from Lebanon, Illinois, to give him $429,000 of their retirement savings. In return for this investment, Blassie gave the couple two promissory notes. He agreed to pay the couple interest on the notes and used money he obtained through his check kite scheme to pay some of that interest. As security for his promissory notes, Blassie pledged 128 of his and his wife’s shares of the holding company which owns the Bank of O’Fallon.
“This indictment sends a clear message that bank executives who engage in fraud that impacts the safety and soundness of financial institutions will be held accountable for their actions,” said Jon Ellwanger, Special Agent in Charge, Western Region, Office of Inspector General for the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
According to the indictment, Blassie later sold most of these shares and did not use those funds to repay the Lebanon couple. This left the couple with no means of recourse when Blassie later defaulted on the promissory notes.
“The Federal Housing Finance Agency, Office of Inspector General (FHFA-OIG) is committed to investigating allegations of fraud involving financial institutions, particularly the Federal Home Loan Banks,” said Korey Brinkman, Special Agent in Charge of the FHFA-OIG’s Central Region. “We are proud to have partnered with the U.S. Secret Service, FDIC OIG, FRB OIG, and the O’Fallon (IL) Police Department on this case.”
Officials with the Bank of O’Fallon have fully cooperated with law enforcement during the investigation.
An indictment is merely a formal charge against a defendant. Under the law, a defendant is presumed to be innocent of a charge until proved guilty beyond a reasonable doubt to the satisfaction of a jury.
Blassie’s first appearance is scheduled for 10 a.m. on April 23 at the federal courthouse in East St. Louis.
Convictions for bank fraud are punishable by up to 30 years’ imprisonment and interstate transportation of security or funds obtained by fraud can earn up to 10 years in federal prison.
The O’Fallon Police Department, U.S. Secret Service, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General, the Office of Inspector General for the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and the Federal Housing Finance Agency, Office of Inspector General made contributions to the investigation.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Scott Verseman is prosecuting the case.

According to the factual stipulations in the guilty pleas, Khatiwala was the owner and managing member of Delaware Hotel Group LLC (DHG), and an operator of GMK Consulting LLC (GMK) and KPG Hotel Mgmt. LLC (KPG). These LLCs were hotel management and loan brokerage companies located in Mount Laurel, New Jersey.  Watkins served as a project coordinator for DHG and managing member of Forza Consulting LLC (Forza), a hotel consulting and loan brokerage company located in Marlton, New Jersey.  Parkih was an owner of KPG.  Co-defendant Rebecca Marie Cohn a/k/a Rebecca Marie Stanton, 38, was a settlement and title processor for Residential Title & Escrow Company, a real estate title company located in Owings Mills, Maryland, that offered escrow and loan-settlement services. The guilty pleas outline how from August 2018 through February 2020, Khatiwala, Parikh, and Watkins conspired to obtain loan proceeds to buy and sell hotels in connection with a hotel flipping scheme. “Flipping” is a real estate investment strategy that involves purchasing property to hold for a short period before selling it to make a quick profit.  During the SBA-loan application process, the co-conspirators made and caused others to make material misrepresentations and omissions to financial institutions regarding the sellers’ identity, familial relationships between parties, and the nature and amount of the equity injected by the borrowers.  The defendants sought loans through the SBA’s Section 7(a) Program, which guaranteed and insured approximately 75-85 percent of these loans, and required that the small business owner/borrower invest a certain amount of their own money into the business to qualify for the loan.
In their guilty pleas, Khatiwala and Parikh admitted that they acted as managers or supervisors in connection with the scheme.  Additionally, Khatiwala, Parikh, and Watkins admitted that they created shell companies using co-conspirators as straw owners of the entities.  These straw owners had no actual ownership interest in the entities as Khatiwala and Parikh were the true owners.  The straw owners signed purchase contracts, operating agreements, and related documents to buy hotel properties in the name of the shell companies.
Co-conspirators then created a second company to purchase the hotels from the shell companies at substantially higher prices.  After the co-conspirators formed the companies to control both sides of the flip transaction, they solicited banks for small-business loans to finance the buying company’s purchase of the hotel from the straw companies.  The co-conspirators helped the buying companies qualify for the loans by falsely representing investors’ equity injections to the banks, among other material false statements, misrepresentations, and omissions.  The financial institutions extending the loans relied on the false statements and misrepresentations.
Khatiwala, Parikh, and Watkins are each facing a maximum sentence of 30 years in federal prison for conspiracy to commit bank fraud.
Actual sentences for federal crimes are typically less than the maximum penalties. A federal district court judge determines sentencing after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.
U.S. Attorney Hayes commended the FHFA-OIG and FDIC-OIG for their work in the investigation.  Ms. Hayes also thanked Assistant U.S. Attorneys Harry M. Gruber, Evelyn L. Cusson, and Ari D. Evans, who are prosecuting the federal case, and recognized Paralegal Specialists Joanna B.N. Huber and Zharde Todman.

Greenbelt , Maryland – Today, Mountee Brown, 27, a former bank teller from Clinton, Maryland, pled guilty to bank fraud and aggravated identity theft in connection with a scheme to steal funds from bank customers.
Kelly O. Hayes, U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland, announced the guilty plea with Special Agent in Charge Jeffrey D. Pittano, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC-OIG), Mid-Atlantic Region.
According to his guilty plea, Brown worked as a bank teller with Bank A, located in Upper Marlboro, Maryland. In his role, he had access to the bank accounts of five victims, four of whom were over the age of 80. Between October and November 2022, Brown and his co-conspirators devised a scheme to use his position as a bank teller to make at least 26 unauthorized cash withdrawals involving the victims’ accounts.
The co-conspirators began carrying out the scheme on October 21, 2022, when Co-conspirator #1 entered Bank A and approached Brown at his designated teller station. Brown knew that Co-conspirator #1 was not Victim #1. But Brown and Co-conspirator #1 conducted a $10,000 cash withdrawal from Victim #1’s account without Victim #1’s knowledge or consent. Brown conducted the cash withdrawal by falsely documenting that he verified the customer, the customer was a “known client,” and that the customer was known by Brown’s supervisor. Co-conspirator #1 falsely signed the withdrawal ticket as Victim #1.
Then on October 22, 2022, Brown and Co-conspirator #1 conducted two additional unauthorized withdrawal transactions from Victim #1’s account totaling $20,000. The same day, Brown deposited approximately $4,300 in cash in an account at another financial institution.
On October 25, 2022, Co-conspirator #2 entered Bank A and approached Brown at his designated teller station. Brown knew that Co-conspirator #2 was not Victim #2. However, Brown and Co-conspirator #2 conducted a $10,000 cash withdrawal from Victim #2’s account without Victim #2’s knowledge or consent. Brown conducted the cash withdrawal by falsely documenting that he verified the customer, the customer was a “known client,” and the customer was known by Brown’s supervisor. Co-conspirator #2 falsely signed the withdrawal ticket as Victim #2.
On the same day, Co-conspirator #2 re-entered Bank A and approached Brown at his designated teller station. Brown and Co-conspirator #2 conducted a $10,000 cash withdrawal from Victim #3’s account, without Victim #3’s knowledge or consent. Brown conducted the cash withdrawal by falsely stating he verified the customer, the customer was a “known client,” and the customer was known by Brown’s supervisor. Co-conspirator #2 falsely signed the withdrawal ticket as Victim #3.
Between October 22, 2022, and December 6, 2022, Brown made cash deposits of approximately $30,200 into his personal account at another financial institution. As a result of his participation in the fraud, Brown and other co-conspirators obtained, directly or indirectly, an amount up to approximately $255,000.
U.S. Attorney Hayes commended the FDIC-OIG for its work in the investigation.  Ms. Hayes also thanked Assistant U.S. Attorneys Sean R. Delaney and Darren Gardner who are prosecuting the federal case.

Two Fiji Nationals Sentenced to Prison for Carrying Out Multi-Million Dollar Real Estate Short Sale Fraud,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/two-fiji-nationals-sentenced-prison-carrying-out-multi-million,2025-04-01,2025,"FRESNO , Calif. — Jyoteshna Karan, 52, and Praveen Singh, 45, both of Modesto, were sentenced for leading a multi-million dollar mortgage fraud scheme, Acting United States Attorney Michele Beckwith announced today.  Karan received three years and four months in prison, and Singh received two years.
According to court records, from 2006 through 2015, Karan and Singh conspired to make straw purchases and short sales of approximately 15 homes from Modesto to Sacramento.  A straw purchase is where one person buys a home on behalf of another person to get around certain restrictions.  Straw purchases are generally illegal in the real estate industry because they compromise lenders’ risk management practices.  A short sale is where a homeowner sells their home for less than the amount they owe on their mortgage, with lender approval, to avoid foreclosure.  Short sales must generally be arm’s length transactions in the real estate industry because that helps protect buyers and sellers from undervaluation, overpayment, and bias.
After Karan and Singh acquired the homes, they allowed them to go into foreclosure and arranged for short sales with the lenders.  They then quickly resold, or flipped, the homes to other people at market rates and therefore reaped significant profits.  In doing so, they caused the lenders to suffer over $3,000,000 in losses.
Karan and Singh were experienced real estate professionals who used unwitting participants, fabricated documents, and shell companies to carry out their fraud.  For example, they used Singh’s mother as one of the straw purchasers, fabricated documents to make it appear as though the straw purchasers worked for their shell companies making six figure salaries, and fabricated documents to make it appear as though the transactions were arm’s length.  This was all done to convince the lenders to go through with the deals.
This case is the product of an investigation by the FBI, FDIC OIG, and the Stanislaus County District Attorney’s Office.  Assistant United States Attorney Joseph Barton prosecuted the case.

Olaf Kyros Gustafsson, 31, a.k.a. “El Silencio,” arrived in Los Angeles this morning after Spanish authorities extradited him. Gustafsson is charged with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and mail fraud, nine counts of wire fraud, three counts of mail fraud, one count of conspiracy to engage in money laundering, 41 counts of money laundering, 35 counts of international money laundering, and 25 counts of engaging in monetary transactions in property derived from specified unlawful activity.
Gustafsson was arrested in Spain in December 2023 and was arraigned this afternoon in United States District Court in downtown Los Angeles. Gustafsson pleaded not guilty to the charges against him. A May 20 trial date was scheduled. A federal magistrate judge scheduled an April 3 detention hearing. Gustafsson remains in federal custody.
According to the indictment, Gustafsson was the CEO of Escobar Inc., a corporation registered in Puerto Rico that held successor-in-interest rights to the persona and legacy of Pablo Escobar, the deceased Colombian narcoterrorist and head of the Medellín Cartel. Escobar Inc. used Pablo Escobar’s likeness and persona to market and sell purported consumer products to the public.
From July 2019 to November 2023, Gustafsson identified existing products in the marketplace that were being manufactured and sold to the public. He then used the Escobar persona to market and advertise similar and competing products purportedly being sold by Escobar Inc., advertising them at a price substantially lower than existing counterparts being sold by other companies.
Gustafsson then purportedly sold the products – including an Escobar Flamethrower, an Escobar Fold Phone, an Escobar Gold 11 Pro Phone, and Escobar Cash (marketed as a “physical cryptocurrency”) – to customers, receiving payments via PayPal, Stripe, Coinbase, among other payment processors.
Despite receiving customer payments, Gustafsson did not deliver the Escobar Inc. products to paying customers because the products did not exist.
In furtherance of the scheme, Gustafsson sent crudely made samples of the purported Escobar Inc. products to online technology reviewers and social media influencers to attempt to increase the public’s demand for them. For example, Gustafsson allegedly sent Samsung Galaxy Fold Phones wrapped in gold foil and disguised as Escobar Inc. phones to online technology reviewers to attempt to induce victims who watched the online reviews into buying the products that never would be delivered.
Also, rather than sending paying customers the actual products, Gustafsson mailed them a “Certificate of Ownership,” a book or other Escobar Inc. promotional materials so there was a record of mailing from the company to the customer. When a paying customer attempted to obtain a refund when the product was never delivered, Gustafsson fraudulently referred the payment processor to the proof of mailing for the Certificate of Ownership or other material as proof that the product itself was shipped and that the customer had received it so the refund requests would be denied.
Some of the victims include residents of Los Angeles, Gardena, and Commerce.
Gustafsson allegedly also caused bank accounts to be opened under his name and entities he controlled to be used as funnel accounts – bank accounts into which he deposited and withdrew proceeds derived from his criminal activities. The purpose was to conceal and disguise the nature, location, source, ownership, and control of the proceeds. The bank accounts were located in the United States, Sweden, and the United Arab Emirates.
An indictment is merely an allegation. All defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.
IRS Criminal Investigation, the FBI, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation-Office of Inspector General are investigating this matter, with assistance from the Department of Justice’s Office of International Affairs, the United States Marshals Service, Eurojust, Spanish authorities, and French judicial authorities.

Olaf Kyros Gustafsson, 31, a.k.a. “El Silencio,” arrived in Los Angeles this morning after Spanish authorities extradited him.

"Mortgage Broker That Ran a Ponzi Scheme, Fraudulently Acquired CARES Act SBA Loans, and Filed a False Tax Return is Sentenced to Federal Prison",https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/mortgage-broker-ran-ponzi-scheme-fraudulently-acquired-cares-act,2025-03-27,2025,"PROVIDENCE, RI – A Rhode Island mortgage broker who ran a Ponzi scheme with investors’ monies causing millions of dollars in losses, who fraudulently obtained more than $160,000 in COVID-19 pandemic-related SBA loans, and who failed to pay more than $140,000 in taxes due the IRS was sentenced today to more than four years in federal prison and was ordered to pay restitution to his victims, announced Acting United States Attorney Sara Miron Bloom.
Joseph Giuttari, owner and operator of Hybrid Capital Group, LLC, THE FENS CO., LLC, and Realty Funding Advisors, LLC, was sentenced by U.S. District Court Judge Melissa R. DuBose to 55 months of incarceration to be followed by three years of supervised release. Additionally, Giuttari was ordered to pay a fine of $20,000 and to pay restitution to victims of his Ponzi scheme, to SBA loan programs, and to the IRS totaling $4,579,130.95.
Mr. Giuttari pleaded guilty on October 31, 2024, to charges of wire fraud, theft of government property, and filing a false tax return.  The day after his guilty plea he engaged in brokerage activities in violation of his condition of release.  Upon discovery of his activities, the Court revoked its order of release and remanded him to the custody of the U.S. Marshal pending sentencing.
Court documents reflect that Joseph Giuttari purported to match borrowers seeking short-term loans with private lenders seeking secured investments in real estate. As part of the scheme, Giuttari served as the clearing house for funds between the borrowers and the investors. In executing his scheme, Giuttari directed investors and closing attorneys to send all or a portion of the loan proceeds directly to him through his multiple business entities and business bank accounts. Instead of forwarding these funds to borrowers as represented to the investors, Giuttari used the money personally or to repay earlier investors who were seeking a return on their investments.
Additionally, Giuttari fraudulently acquired $167,800 in COVID-19 pandemic Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL) for Hybrid Capital Group and THE FENS CO that he was not entitled to receive, and he falsely stated on his 2019 U.S. Individual Income Tax Return that his total income was $22,176, when in fact it was at least $541,000, thus failing to pay $140,102 due the IRS.
The case was prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Sandra R. Hebert.

"Par Funding CEO Sentenced to 15½ Years in Prison for RICO Conspiracy, Securities Fraud, Tax Crimes, and Related Offenses",https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/par-funding-ceo-sentenced-15-12-years-prison-rico-conspiracy,2025-03-26,2025,"PHILADELPHIA – United States Attorney David Metcalf announced that Joseph LaForte, 54, of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, was sentenced today by United States District Court Judge Mark A. Kearney to 186 months in prison and three years of supervised release, to include 12 months in home confinement, for numerous crimes arising from the defendant’s operation of a fraudulent investment vehicle known as Complete Business Solutions Group Inc. d/b/a Par Funding (“Par Funding”). In addition, LaForte was sentenced to forfeit various assets, including a private jet and an investment account totaling approximately $20 million, along with a $120 million forfeiture money judgment, as well as restitution in the amount of $314 million, and a $50,000 fine.
In January 2025, the Court found the Par Funding fraud scheme caused an actual fraud loss of approximately $404,000,000, which it reduced to $288,395,088 after factoring in credit for collateral that federal authorities seized from Par Funding when the investigation became public in July 2020, upon the SEC placing Par Funding in receivership.
The defendant, who functioned as Par Funding’s president and CEO, his brother James LaForte, Par Funding’s “enforcer,” and Joseph Cole Barleta, Par Funding’s chief financial officer, were charged in a February 2024 amended second superseding indictment with racketeering conspiracy and related crimes.
In September 2024, Joseph LaForte pleaded guilty to the RICO charge, securities fraud, tax crimes, and perjury. He also pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice for his role in aiding and abetting James LaForte’s violent assault on one of the receivership’s Philadelphia attorneys, and to a gun possession charge for firearms found in his former residence during the execution of a search warrant.
James LaForte pleaded guilty in September 2024 to racketeering conspiracy, securities fraud, and extortionate collection of debt, as well as obstruction of justice, for his assault on the receivership attorney, and retaliation, for threatening several government witnesses. He was sentenced earlier this month to 11½ years in prison.
Barleta pleaded guilty in October 2024 to one count of racketeering conspiracy and is scheduled to be sentenced on June 2, 2025.
***
As detailed in court filings, the defendant served as the undisputed leader of a years-long criminal enterprise consisting of his codefendants and others. The principal purpose of this enterprise was to generate money for its leadership and members, primarily by defrauding the investors in Par Funding, which the enterprise controlled until it was placed in receivership.
Joseph LaForte and his conspirators caused false and misleading information to be conveyed to investors regarding various issues, including:
▪ Joseph LaForte’s true name, his role at Par Funding, and his criminal history;
▪ Par Funding’s underwriting process;
▪ the diversity of the company’s MCA portfolio;
▪ Par Funding’s default rate;
▪ Par Funding’s financial success and profitability;
▪ the company’s insurance; and
▪ the defendants’ self-dealing.
Par Funding’s principal means of generating income was to “advance” money to businesses (known as merchant cash advance or “MCA” customers) that were in need of short-term financing at high rates of return.
The enterprise would use threats of violence to collect money from customers whose payments were overdue. James LaForte admitted that, in threatening one particular Par Funding customer, he told the customer that he must repay the company immediately because James LaForte was not to be messed with and had previously torched people’s cars and kicked people’s teeth in.
Another Par Funding collector admitted to extorting multiple customers at Joseph LaForte’s direction, including through threats of physical harm to the customers or their families if the debt was not paid back. And as established at his sentencing hearing, Joseph LaForte also threatened and extorted customers who fell behind in their payments, such as by telling a Par Funding customer to keep paying her debts or he would bomb her car, kidnap her children, and outfit her with “cement shoes” to sink her to the bottom of the Hudson River.
The reality hidden from Par Funding’s investors was that, during every year from 2016 through mid-2020, Par Funding’s MCA business was not profitable enough to repay the money owed to Par Funding’s investors while also covering its operating expenses (including tens of millions of dollars Joseph LaForte was paying himself annually). LaForte thus needed to acquire increasingly large injections of new investor money just to keep the lights on and the business running, a hallmark of a traditional Ponzi scheme.
From 2015 until the unraveling of the fraud in mid-2020, Joseph LaForte caused Par Funding to pay him and his wife more than $120,000,000 in fraudulent proceeds, with which he purchased homes, vacation properties, vehicles, artwork, jewelry, dozens of investment properties, a boat, and a private jet. LaForte rewarded the loyalty of co-conspirators, including James LaForte and Cole Barleta, by making each of them multi-millionaires.
For years, the defendant committed a variety of tax crimes related to his fraudulent proceeds, including conspiring to defraud the IRS and filing false tax returns, as well as employment tax fraud. The total federal tax loss stemming from LaForte’s crimes exceeds $8 million. He also caused $1.6 million in state tax loss to the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue by falsely reporting that he and his wife were residents of Florida from 2013 through 2019, when in fact they resided in Pennsylvania.
“Joe LaForte is a career grifter,” said U.S. Attorney Metcalf. “He has spent his adult life lying, cheating, and stealing his way to a lavish lifestyle paid for with other people’s money. Consider LaForte’s vast criminality here: a decade’s worth of financial and tax crimes, acts of obstruction, perjury, extortionate threats, the aiding and abetting of his brother’s violent assault on an attorney, and the illegal possession of multiple guns. He has earned every day of his prison sentence. My office is committed to prosecuting these complex financial cases, to bring fraud victims some relief and the crooks who victimized them to justice.”
“Today’s sentencing holds Joseph LaForte accountable for the full scope of his criminal conduct in leading a long-running fraudulent enterprise,” said Wayne A. Jacobs, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI’s Philadelphia Field Office. “The FBI and our partners remain unwavering in our commitment to uncover, investigate, and dismantle complex financial fraud schemes — and to pursue justice and restitution for the victims they leave behind.”
“This case exemplifies how cooperative law enforcement efforts lead to the exposure of individuals and groups seeking to circumvent our laws for financial gain,” said IRS Criminal Investigation Special Agent in Charge Yury Kruty. “An investigation such as this takes a dedicated team of investigators and prosecutors many hours of hard work and sacrifice to bring to a successful conclusion.”
“Today’s sentencing brings Joseph LaForte to justice for operating a fraudulent investment vehicle that he and his co-conspirators used to generate hundreds of millions of dollars illegally, while harming Par Funding’s numerous investors,” said Patricia Tarasca, Special Agent in Charge of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC OIG), New York Region. “The FDIC OIG will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to hold accountable those who deceive investors for their own selfish gain and threaten the safety and soundness of our Nation’s financial system.”
The case was investigated by the FBI, Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General, and is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys Matthew Newcomer, Samuel Dalke, and Eric Gill, as well as Assistant U.S. Attorney John J. Boscia and DOJ Trial Attorney Ezra Spiro on the tax portion of the prosecution.
The SEC in Florida investigated and litigated the civil securities fraud charges, which formed the basis of a portion of the criminal prosecution.

The fraud involved misleading investors about the company’s financial health and using threats of violence to collect debts from customers, resembling a Ponzi scheme. The misconduct was detected after it occurred, with the investigation becoming public in July 2020 when the SEC placed Par Funding into receivership. Key outcomes of the case included the forfeiture of various assets totaling around $120 million, a $50,000 fine, and restitution of $314 million, along with multiple co-defendants facing charges related to racketeering and extortion. The case exemplified a collaborative law enforcement effort involving the FBI, IRS, and FDIC to dismantle the fraudulent enterprise.","```json

```",True,fraudulent investment vehicle,Investment Fraud,Tax Fraud,Law Enforcement Investigation,Philadelphia/Pennsylvania,"$404,000,000",404000000.0,"PHILADELPHIA – United States Attorney David Metcalf announced that Joseph LaForte, 54, of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, was sentenced today by United States District Court Judge Mark A. Kearney to 186 months in prison and three years of supervised release, to include 12 months in home confinement, for numerous crimes arising from the defendant’s operation of a fraudulent investment vehicle known as Complete Business Solutions Group Inc. d/b/a Par Funding (“Par Funding”). In addition, LaForte was sentenced to forfeit various assets, including a private jet and an investment account totaling approximately $20 million, along with a $120 million forfeiture money judgment, as well as restitution in the amount of $314 million, and a $50,000 fine.
In January 2025, the Court found the Par Funding fraud scheme caused an actual fraud loss of approximately $404,000,000, which it reduced to $288,395,088 after factoring in credit for collateral that federal authorities seized from Par Funding when the investigation became public in July 2020, upon the SEC placing Par Funding in receivership.
The defendant, who functioned as Par Funding’s president and CEO, his brother James LaForte, Par Funding’s “enforcer,” and Joseph Cole Barleta, Par Funding’s chief financial officer, were charged in a February 2024 amended second superseding indictment with racketeering conspiracy and related crimes.
In September 2024, Joseph LaForte pleaded guilty to the RICO charge, securities fraud, tax crimes, and perjury. He also pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice for his role in aiding and abetting James LaForte’s violent assault on one of the receivership’s Philadelphia attorneys, and to a gun possession charge for firearms found in his former residence during the execution of a search warrant.
James LaForte pleaded guilty in September 2024 to racketeering conspiracy, securities fraud, and extortionate collection of debt, as well as obstruction of justice, for his assault on the receivership attorney, and retaliation, for threatening several government witnesses. He was sentenced earlier this month to 11½ years in prison.
Barleta pleaded guilty in October 2024 to one count of racketeering conspiracy and is scheduled to be sentenced on June 2, 2025.
***
As detailed in court filings, the defendant served as the undisputed leader of a years-long criminal enterprise consisting of his codefendants and others. The principal purpose of this enterprise was to generate money for its leadership and members, primarily by defrauding the investors in Par Funding, which the enterprise controlled until it was placed in receivership.
Joseph LaForte and his conspirators caused false and misleading information to be conveyed to investors regarding various issues, including:
▪ Joseph LaForte’s true name, his role at Par Funding, and his criminal history;
▪ Par Funding’s underwriting process;
▪ the diversity of the company’s MCA portfolio;
▪ Par Funding’s default rate;
▪ Par Funding’s financial success and profitability;
▪ the company’s insurance; and
▪ the defendants’ self-dealing.
Par Funding’s principal means of generating income was to “advance” money to businesses (known as merchant cash advance or “MCA” customers) that were in need of short-term financing at high rates of return.
The enterprise would use threats of violence to collect money from customers whose payments were overdue. James LaForte admitted that, in threatening one particular Par Funding customer, he told the customer that he must repay the company immediately because James LaForte was not to be messed with and had previously torched people’s cars and kicked people’s teeth in.
Another Par Funding collector admitted to extorting multiple customers at Joseph LaForte’s direction, including through threats of physical harm to the customers or their families if the debt was not paid back. And as established at his sentencing hearing, Joseph LaForte also threatened and extorted customers who fell behind in their payments, such as by telling a Par Funding customer to keep paying her debts or he would bomb her car, kidnap her children, and outfit her with “cement shoes” to sink her to the bottom of the Hudson River.
The reality hidden from Par Funding’s investors was that, during every year from 2016 through mid-2020, Par Funding’s MCA business was not profitable enough to repay the money owed to Par Funding’s investors while also covering its operating expenses (including tens of millions of dollars Joseph LaForte was paying himself annually). LaForte thus needed to acquire increasingly large injections of new investor money just to keep the lights on and the business running, a hallmark of a traditional Ponzi scheme.
From 2015 until the unraveling of the fraud in mid-2020, Joseph LaForte caused Par Funding to pay him and his wife more than $120,000,000 in fraudulent proceeds, with which he purchased homes, vacation properties, vehicles, artwork, jewelry, dozens of investment properties, a boat, and a private jet. LaForte rewarded the loyalty of co-conspirators, including James LaForte and Cole Barleta, by making each of them multi-millionaires.
For years, the defendant committed a variety of tax crimes related to his fraudulent proceeds, including conspiring to defraud the IRS and filing false tax returns, as well as employment tax fraud. The total federal tax loss stemming from LaForte’s crimes exceeds $8 million. He also caused $1.6 million in state tax loss to the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue by falsely reporting that he and his wife were residents of Florida from 2013 through 2019, when in fact they resided in Pennsylvania.
“Joe LaForte is a career grifter,” said U.S. Attorney Metcalf. “He has spent his adult life lying, cheating, and stealing his way to a lavish lifestyle paid for with other people’s money. Consider LaForte’s vast criminality here: a decade’s worth of financial and tax crimes, acts of obstruction, perjury, extortionate threats, the aiding and abetting of his brother’s violent assault on an attorney, and the illegal possession of multiple guns. He has earned every day of his prison sentence. My office is committed to prosecuting these complex financial cases, to bring fraud victims some relief and the crooks who victimized them to justice.”
“Today’s sentencing holds Joseph LaForte accountable for the full scope of his criminal conduct in leading a long-running fraudulent enterprise,” said Wayne A. Jacobs, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI’s Philadelphia Field Office. “The FBI and our partners remain unwavering in our commitment to uncover, investigate, and dismantle complex financial fraud schemes — and to pursue justice and restitution for the victims they leave behind.”
“This case exemplifies how cooperative law enforcement efforts lead to the exposure of individuals and groups seeking to circumvent our laws for financial gain,” said IRS Criminal Investigation Special Agent in Charge Yury Kruty. “An investigation such as this takes a dedicated team of investigators and prosecutors many hours of hard work and sacrifice to bring to a successful conclusion.”
“Today’s sentencing brings Joseph LaForte to justice for operating a fraudulent investment vehicle that he and his co-conspirators used to generate hundreds of millions of dollars illegally, while harming Par Funding’s numerous investors,” said Patricia Tarasca, Special Agent in Charge of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC OIG), New York Region. “The FDIC OIG will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to hold accountable those who deceive investors for their own selfish gain and threaten the safety and soundness of our Nation’s financial system.”
The case was investigated by the FBI, Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General, and is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys Matthew Newcomer, Samuel Dalke, and Eric Gill, as well as Assistant U.S. Attorney John J. Boscia and DOJ Trial Attorney Ezra Spiro on the tax portion of the prosecution.
The SEC in Florida investigated and litigated the civil securities fraud charges, which formed the basis of a portion of the criminal prosecution.

Maryland Man Sentenced to Federal Prison for Pandemic Relief Loan Fraud and Commercial Loan Fraud,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/maryland-man-sentenced-federal-prison-pandemic-relief-loan-fraud,2025-03-19,2025,"Defendant admitted to spending portions of fraudulent-loan proceeds on a Lamborghini and home renovations.
Greenbelt , Maryland – U.S. District Judge Lydia K. Griggsby sentenced Andra Shirone Thompson, 48, of Silver Spring, Maryland, to a year and a day for two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud.
Thompson pled guilty to conspiring to defraud Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act loan programs and his role in a years-long scheme to defraud commercial equipment financing companies. He was also sentenced to three years of supervised released and ordered to forfeit $847,280, and pay $813,363.01 in restitution to the victims of his schemes.
Kelly O. Hayes, U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland, made the announcement with Supervisory Official Matthew Galeotti, Justice Department’s Criminal Division; Executive Special Agent in Charge Kareem Carter, IRS Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI) Washington, D.C., Field Office; Jeffrey D. Pittano, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC-OIG), Mid-Atlantic Region; Special Agent in Charge Amaleka McCall-Braithwaite, Small Business Administration Office of Inspector General (SBA-OIG), Eastern Region; and Special Agent in Charge William J. DelBagno of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) – Baltimore Field Office.
According to his guilty plea, Thompson admitted to participating in a conspiracy to submit fraudulent applications for Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL) and Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans on behalf of companies he controlled. The companies included Alpha Bravo Tango LLC., Senergy Consulting Group Inc., and Novus Ordo Seclorum LLC. Through the scheme, Thompson fraudulently obtained $716,375. He spent a portion of the proceeds on vehicles, including a 2014 Lamborghini Aventador, and on renovating a home in North Carolina.
Thompson also joined a conspiracy to defraud equipment financing companies by submitting fraudulent invoices that falsely showed the sale of substantial quantities of computer servers and related equipment. Thompson and his co-conspirators caused borrowers to submit fraudulent invoices to lenders to support their loan applications to purchase items. After approval, lenders deposited loan proceeds into accounts controlled by Thompson and his co-conspirators. The lenders were unaware that the sales on the invoices never occurred. Thompson and his co-conspirators typically “kicked back” a portion of the proceeds to the borrower who submitted the application and kept the rest for themselves. Thompson personally participated in three executions of this scheme, causing approximately $813,362 in fraudulently induced lending.
Additionally, the co-conspirators caused more than $60 million of fraudulently induced lending across more than 350 separate loans through this scheme. Thompson’s principal co-conspirator, Craig David Davis, 49, of Venice, California, pleaded guilty to wire fraud in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia and was sentenced earlier this month to 93 months incarceration.
Financial assistance offered through the CARES Act included forgivable loans to small businesses for job retention and other expenses, through the PPP, administered through the Small Business Administration (SBA).  The SBA also offered an EIDL and/or an EIDL advance to help businesses meet their financial obligations.
The District of Maryland Strike Force is one of five strike forces established throughout the United States by the U.S. Department of Justice to investigate and prosecute COVID-19 fraud, including fraud relating to the CARES Act. The CARES Act was designed to provide emergency financial assistance to Americans suffering the economic effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.  The strike forces focus on large-scale, multi-state pandemic relief fraud perpetrated by criminal organizations and transnational actors.  The strike forces are interagency law enforcement efforts, using prosecutor-led and data analyst-driven teams designed to identify and bring to justice those who stole pandemic relief funds.

"Former Principals of Aerospace Start-Up Company Charged with Fraud, Fraud Conspiracy, and Tax Evasion",https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/former-principals-aerospace-start-company-charged-fraud-fraud,2025-03-18,2025,"WASHINGTON – An indictment was unsealed today charging five former principals of aerospace start-up company Theia Group, Inc.—Erlend Olson, John Gallagher, Stephen Buscher, Joseph Fargnoli, and Jamil Swati—with a multi-year scheme to defraud investors and lenders out of $250 million, and further charging Olson with evading more than $3.9 million in personal federal income taxes. Theia Group, Inc. (Theia) had its headquarters in Washington D.C.
Law enforcement made arrests yesterday in Albuquerque, New Mexico (Olson), Memphis, Tennessee (Buscher), and today in Broomall, Pennsylvania (Gallagher), Rochester, New York (Fargnoli), and Bridgeport, Connecticut (Swati).
The indictment was announced by U.S. Attorney Edward R. Martin, Jr. Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General Karen E. Kelly of the Justice Department’s Tax Division, Special Agent in Charge Jeffrey D. Pittano of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) Office of Inspector General, and Executive Special Agent in Charge Kareem Carter of the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI) Washington D.C. Office.
According to the indictment, Theia planned to launch 112 satellites starting in 2022 at a cost of $10 billion to $15 billion. Theia’s principals originally planned to raise the requisite funds from various nation-states by promising perpetual data and analytics for an upfront cost of $2 billion. However, from Theia’s founding in 2015 through its placement into receivership in 2021, Theia was unsuccessful in obtaining any funding except for approximately $250 million in loans and investments that Theia’s principals induced by fraud. Olson, Gallagher, Buscher, Fargnoli, and Swati’s fraud scheme allegedly included materially false statements about revenue from non-existent government contracts, provision of multiple false financial statements, including a fake $6 billion escrow account statement, and false representations about Theia’s technical capabilities.
The indictment further alleges that, between 2018 and 2020, Theia’s founder, Erlend Olson, concealed from the IRS millions of dollars in compensation he received from Theia. In addition to not filing tax returns or paying any taxes for 2018 through 2020, Olson allegedly directed his compensation from Theia to a nominee entity called Meridian Vector Corporation (MVC). Olson then used MVC funds to pay personal expenses such as personal debts, a private jet membership, $64,500 annual rent payments for his home, a new Land Rover, and a pair of condominiums in Las Vegas. Olson also allegedly evaded payment of taxes that he owed the IRS for tax years 2009 through 2011 by directing that his pay and bonuses not be reported to the IRS.
Olson, Gallagher, Buscher, Fargnoli, and Swati are each charged with one count of conspiracy to commit wire and mail fraud. Olson also is charged with five counts of wire fraud, one count of mail fraud, and four counts of tax evasion. Gallagher is also charged with five counts of wire fraud and one count of mail fraud. Buscher also is charged with three counts of wire fraud. Fargnoli is also charged with two counts of wire fraud. Swati is also charged with one count of wire fraud.
If convicted, Olson, Gallagher, Buscher, Fargnoli, and Swati face up to 20 years in prison for the conspiracy count, as well as up to 20 years in prison for each wire fraud or mail fraud count. Each also face a period of supervised release, restitution, monetary penalties, and forfeiture. Olson faces up to five years in prison for each tax evasion count. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.
FDIC Office of Inspector General and IRS Criminal Investigation is investigating the case.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Rebecca G. Ross, and Assistant U.S. Attorney Joshua Gold of the District of Columbia, Senior Litigation Counsel Nanette Davis, and Trial Attorney Alexis Hughes of the Tax Division are prosecuting the case.
An indictment is merely an allegation, and the defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.

The indictment was announced by U.S. Attorney Edward R. Martin, Jr. Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General Karen E. Kelly of the Justice Department’s Tax Division, Special Agent in Charge Jeffrey D. Pittano of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) Office of Inspector General, and Executive Special Agent in Charge Kareem Carter of the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI) Washington D.C. Office.
According to the indictment, Theia planned to launch 112 satellites starting in 2022 at a cost of $10 billion to $15 billion. Theia’s principals originally planned to raise the requisite funds from various nation-states by promising perpetual data and analytics for an upfront cost of $2 billion. However, from Theia’s founding in 2015 through its placement into receivership in 2021, Theia was unsuccessful in obtaining any funding except for approximately $250 million in loans and investments that Theia’s principals induced by fraud. Olson, Gallagher, Buscher, Fargnoli, and Swati’s fraud scheme allegedly included materially false statements about revenue from non-existent government contracts, provision of multiple false financial statements, including a fake $6 billion escrow account statement, and false representations about Theia’s technical capabilities.
The indictment further alleges that, between 2018 and 2020, Theia’s founder, Erlend Olson, concealed from the IRS millions of dollars in compensation he received from Theia. In addition to not filing tax returns or paying any taxes for 2018 through 2020, Olson allegedly directed his compensation from Theia to a nominee entity called Meridian Vector Corporation (MVC). Olson then used MVC funds to pay personal expenses such as personal debts, a private jet membership, $64,500 annual rent payments for his home, a new Land Rover, and a pair of condominiums in Las Vegas. Olson also allegedly evaded payment of taxes that he owed the IRS for tax years 2009 through 2011 by directing that his pay and bonuses not be reported to the IRS.
Olson, Gallagher, Buscher, Fargnoli, and Swati are each charged with one count of conspiracy to commit wire and mail fraud. Olson also is charged with five counts of wire fraud, one count of mail fraud, and four counts of tax evasion. Gallagher is also charged with five counts of wire fraud and one count of mail fraud. Buscher also is charged with three counts of wire fraud. Fargnoli is also charged with two counts of wire fraud. Swati is also charged with one count of wire fraud.
If convicted, Olson, Gallagher, Buscher, Fargnoli, and Swati face up to 20 years in prison for the conspiracy count, as well as up to 20 years in prison for each wire fraud or mail fraud count. Each also face a period of supervised release, restitution, monetary penalties, and forfeiture. Olson faces up to five years in prison for each tax evasion count. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.
FDIC Office of Inspector General and IRS Criminal Investigation is investigating the case.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Rebecca G. Ross, and Assistant U.S. Attorney Joshua Gold of the District of Columbia, Senior Litigation Counsel Nanette Davis, and Trial Attorney Alexis Hughes of the Tax Division are prosecuting the case.
An indictment is merely an allegation, and the defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.

"Par Funding “Enforcer” Sentenced to 11½ Years in Prison for RICO Conspiracy, Obstruction of Justice, and Retaliation",https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/par-funding-enforcer-sentenced-11-12-years-prison-rico,2025-03-13,2025,"James LaForte Brutally Assaulted Receivership Attorney, Threatened Government Witnesses, Extorted Merchants
PHILADELPHIA – United States Attorney David Metcalf announced that James LaForte, 48, of New York, New York, was sentenced today by United States District Court Judge Mark A. Kearney to 137 months’ imprisonment, followed by three years of supervised release to include 12 months’ home confinement, for crimes committed as part of a criminal enterprise that ran a fraudulent investment vehicle [1] known as Complete Business Solutions Group, Inc., d/b/a Par Funding (“Par Funding”) for a number of years, before it was taken over by a court-appointed receivership pursuant to a lawsuit filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. LaForte was also ordered to pay $2,488,645 in restitution, representing the portion of investor proceeds that he illegally diverted from Par Funding’s numerous investors for his own use through sham merchant contracts and other self-dealing conduct.
In February 2024, the defendant, his brother Joseph LaForte, Par Funding’s president and CEO, and Joseph Cole Barleta, Par Funding’s chief financial officer, were charged in an amended second superseding indictment with racketeering conspiracy and related crimes.
James LaForte pleaded guilty in September 2024 to racketeering conspiracy, securities fraud, and extortionate collection of debt, as well as obstruction of justice, for his violent assault on one of the Par Funding receivership’s Philadelphia attorneys, and retaliation, for threatening several government witnesses.
“James LaForte served as one of his brother’s enforcers,” said U.S. Attorney Metcalf. “He not only used threats of violence to collect on Par Funding’s debt, but stalked and assaulted an attorney, in retaliation for that man’s efforts to hold the LaForte family responsible for one of the largest financial frauds in Philadelphia’s history. As today’s sentence shows, this brand of brazen and violent lawbreaking simply won’t be tolerated in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.”
“Since its earliest days, the FBI has been dedicated to investigating complex financial crimes,” said Wayne A. Jacobs, Special Agent in Charge of FBI Philadelphia. “James LaForte participated in a criminal enterprise driven by greed and sustained through threats and violence. The FBI is proud to stand with our partners in the pursuit of justice — disrupting these schemes and ensuring restitution for victims.”
“The defendant in this case was brought to justice for his participation in a criminal enterprise that caused significant financial harm to numerous investors,” said Special Agent in Charge Patricia Tarasca of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC OIG), New York Region. “The FDIC OIG will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to pursue those who commit such egregious crimes that threaten investors and the safety and soundness of our Nation's financial institutions.”
Joseph LaForte also pleaded guilty in September 2024 to racketeering conspiracy, securities fraud, and related crimes and is scheduled to be sentenced on March 26, 2025. Barleta pleaded guilty in October 2024 to one count of racketeering conspiracy and is scheduled to be sentenced on June 2, 2025.
This case was investigated by the FBI, Internal Revenue Service - Criminal Investigation, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General, and prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys Matthew Newcomer, Samuel Dalke, and Eric Gill.
The SEC in Florida investigated and litigated the civil securities fraud charges, which formed the basis of a portion of the Par Funding criminal prosecution.
[1] On January 21, 2025, the Court found the Par Funding fraud scheme caused an actual fraud loss of approximately $404,000,000, which it reduced to $288,395,088 after factoring in credit for collateral seized from Par Funding by federal authorities when the investigation became public in July 2020.
