    "text": "WASHINGTON\u2014The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) today released the results of its latest Quarterly Banking Profile, a comprehensive summary of financial results based on reports from 4,421 insured commercial banks and savings institutions. In second quarter 2025, insured depository institutions reported a return on assets (ROA) ratio of 1.13 percent and aggregate net income of $69.9\u00a0billion, a decrease of $677.3 million (1 percent) from the prior quarter. Net income for the industry would have increased absent an increase in provision expenses related to a large bank acquisition.\nHighlights from the Second Quarter 2025 Quarterly Banking Profile\nNet Income Decreased from the Prior Quarter, Led by Higher Provision Expenses: For the 4,421 FDIC-insured commercial banks and savings institutions aggregate quarterly net income totaled $69.9\u00a0billion, down $677.3 million (1 percent) from the prior quarter.\u00a0The banking industry reported an aggregate ROA of 1.13 percent in second quarter 2025, down from 1.16 percent in first quarter 2025 and 1.20 percent in the year-ago quarter. The quarterly decrease in net income was driven by higher provision expenses (up $7.6 billion, or 33.7 percent). The increase in provision expense was largely attributable to the acquisition of one large bank, as accounting standards require the acquiring institution to recognize a provision expense related to certain acquired assets. Absent this large provision expense, net income would have increased due to higher net interest and noninterest income.\nCommunity Bank Net Income Increased from the Prior Quarter: Quarterly net income for the 3,982 community banks insured by the FDIC totaled $7.6 billion in the second quarter, an increase of $842.9\u00a0million (12.5 percent) from first quarter 2025. The community bank pretax ROA increased 15\u00a0basis points from the prior quarter to 1.33 percent. Higher net interest income (up $1.2\u00a0billion, 5.7\u00a0percent) and noninterest income (up $483.3 million, 10.1 percent) more than offset increases in noninterest expense (up $612.7 million, 3.5 percent) and provision expense (up $311.5\u00a0million, 29.2\u00a0percent).\nThe Deposit Insurance Fund Reserve Ratio Increased Five Basis Points to 1.36 Percent: In the second quarter, the Deposit Insurance Fund balance increased $4.4 billion to $145.3 billion. The reserve ratio increased 5 basis points during the quarter to 1.36 percent.\u00a0As of June 30, 2025, the reserve ratio exceeded the statutory minimum and, beginning with third quarter 2025, the FDIC will no longer be operating under the Restoration Plan.\nQuarterly Net Interest Margin Remained Relatively Unchanged from the Prior Quarter: The industry reported a quarterly increase in net interest income (up $2.9 billion, or 1.6 percent) as interest income increased more than interest expense. The net interest margin (NIM) was relatively flat, up by one basis point to 3.26 percent, which is above the pre-pandemic average of 3.25\u00a0percent. 1 The community bank NIM of 3.62 percent increased 16 basis points from the prior quarter, increasing for the fifth consecutive quarter and approaching the pre-pandemic average of 3.63 percent.\nAsset Quality Metrics Remained Generally Favorable, Though Weakness in Certain Portfolios Persisted: Past-due and nonaccrual (PDNA) loans, or loans that are 30 or more days past due or in nonaccrual status, fell 9 basis points from the prior quarter to 1.50 percent of total loans. The industry\u2019s PDNA ratio is still below the pre-pandemic average of 1.94 percent. While banks reported quarterly\u00a0decreases in PDNA of credit card loans (down $1.9 billion, or 24 basis points to 2.98 percent), and 1\u20134 family residential loans (down $1.5 billion, or 7 basis points to 1.86 percent), the PDNA rate for non-owner-occupied commercial real estate (CRE), multifamily CRE, and credit card portfolios remain well above their pre-pandemic averages.\nThe industry\u2019s net charge-off ratio of 0.60 percent decreased 6 basis points from the prior quarter and is 8 basis points lower than the year-ago quarter. This ratio is 12 basis points above the pre-pandemic average.\u00a0Most portfolios have\u00a0net charge-off\u00a0rates above their pre-pandemic averages.\nLoan Growth Accelerated from the Prior Quarter: Total loan and\u00a0lease balances increased $263.7 billion (2.1 percent) from the prior quarter. Loans to non-depository financial institutions (NDFIs) and loans to purchase or carry securities, including margin loans, had the largest dollar increase among loan types reported, though some of this increase was due to continued reclassifications following the finalization of changes to how certain loan products are reported. In addition, credit cards, adjustable-rate 1\u20134 family residential loans, and nonfarm nonresidential CRE contributed to the industry\u2019s quarterly loan growth.\u00a0The industry\u2019s annual rate of loan growth in the second quarter was 4 percent, below the pre-pandemic average of 4.9 percent.\nTotal loans at community banks increased 1.7 percent from the prior quarter and 4.9 percent from the prior year, led by increases in nonfarm nonresidential CRE loans and 1\u20134 family residential mortgage portfolios.\nDomestic Deposits Increased for the Fourth Consecutive Quarter: Domestic deposits increased $101.5 billion (0.6 percent) from first quarter 2025, rising for a fourth consecutive quarter. Estimated uninsured domestic deposits increased $186.4 billion (2.4 percent), offsetting a\u00a0$87.3 billion (0.8\u00a0percent) decline in\u00a0insured domestic deposits.\nThe Total Number of Insured Institutions Declined: The total number of FDIC-insured institutions declined by 41 during the second quarter to 4,421. During the quarter, two banks opened, one bank failed, five banks were sold to non-FDIC-insured institutions, and 37 institutions merged with other banks.\nLast Updated: August 26, 2025",

The FDIC entered into a purchase and assumption agreement with Coleman County State Bank of Coleman, Texas, to assume the insured deposits and some of the assets of the failed institution.\nThe Santa Anna National Bank\u2019s\u00a0sole office will reopen on Monday, June 30, 2025, as a branch of Coleman County State Bank. Depositors of the failed bank will automatically become depositors of Coleman County State Bank. The insured deposits assumed by Coleman County State Bank will continue to be insured by the FDIC so there is no need for customers to change their banking relationship to retain their deposit insurance coverage.\nAll Coleman County State Bank customers (formerly, The Santa Anna National Bank) will have access to their insured deposits and can write checks or use their ATM or debit cards up to their insured limits. Checks drawn on the bank will continue to be processed. Loan customers should continue to make their payments as usual.\nAs of June 18, 2025, The Santa Anna National Bank reported total assets of $63.8 million and total deposits of\u00a0$53.8 million. Approximately\u00a0$2.8 million of the deposits exceeded FDIC insurance limits, an amount that is likely to change once the FDIC obtains additional information from customers. Once further information is available, the FDIC will consider whether to provide uninsured depositors an advance dividend (i.e. access to a portion of their uninsured funds) and will provide more information at that time.\nCustomers with accounts greater than $250,000 should contact the FDIC toll-free at 1-866-314-1744 to set up an appointment to discuss their deposits. This phone number will be operational this evening until 9:00 p.m., Central Time (CT); on Saturday from 9:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m., CT; on Sunday from 12:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m., CT; Monday from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m., CT; and thereafter from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., CT.\nCustomers who would like more information on today\u2019s transaction can call the toll-free number or visit the FDIC\u2019s website .\u00a0Beginning Monday, depositors of The Santa Anna National Bank with more than $250,000 in deposits may visit the FDIC\u2019s webpage \u201cIs My Account Fully Insured?\u201d to determine their insurance coverage.\nColeman County State Bank agreed to assume the insured deposits for a\u00a05.16 percent premium. The FDIC will retain a large portion of the assets of The Santa Anna National Bank for later disposition. The FDIC preliminarily estimates that the failure will cost its Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) about $23.7 million. This loss estimate will change over time as the assets are sold. Suspected fraud contributed to the failure of the bank and estimated cost to the DIF.\nThe Santa Anna National Bank is the second bank to fail in the nation this year. The last bank failure was Pulaski Savings Bank of Chicago on January 17, 2025. The last failure in Texas was The Enloe State Bank of Cooper, Texas on May 31, 2019.\nLast Updated: June 27, 2025",

    "text": "WASHINGTON\u2014The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) today released the results of its latest Quarterly Banking Profile, a comprehensive summary of financial results based on reports from 4,421 insured commercial banks and savings institutions. In second quarter 2025, insured depository institutions reported a return on assets (ROA) ratio of 1.13 percent and aggregate net income of $69.9\u00a0billion, a decrease of $677.3 million (1 percent) from the prior quarter. Net income for the industry would have increased absent an increase in provision expenses related to a large bank acquisition.\nHighlights from the Second Quarter 2025 Quarterly Banking Profile\nNet Income Decreased from the Prior Quarter, Led by Higher Provision Expenses: For the 4,421 FDIC-insured commercial banks and savings institutions aggregate quarterly net income totaled $69.9\u00a0billion, down $677.3 million (1 percent) from the prior quarter.\u00a0The banking industry reported an aggregate ROA of 1.13 percent in second quarter 2025, down from 1.16 percent in first quarter 2025 and 1.20 percent in the year-ago quarter. The quarterly decrease in net income was driven by higher provision expenses (up $7.6 billion, or 33.7 percent). The increase in provision expense was largely attributable to the acquisition of one large bank, as accounting standards require the acquiring institution to recognize a provision expense related to certain acquired assets. Absent this large provision expense, net income would have increased due to higher net interest and noninterest income.\nCommunity Bank Net Income Increased from the Prior Quarter: Quarterly net income for the 3,982 community banks insured by the FDIC totaled $7.6 billion in the second quarter, an increase of $842.9\u00a0million (12.5 percent) from first quarter 2025. The community bank pretax ROA increased 15\u00a0basis points from the prior quarter to 1.33 percent. Higher net interest income (up $1.2\u00a0billion, 5.7\u00a0percent) and noninterest income (up $483.3 million, 10.1 percent) more than offset increases in noninterest expense (up $612.7 million, 3.5 percent) and provision expense (up $311.5\u00a0million, 29.2\u00a0percent).\nThe Deposit Insurance Fund Reserve Ratio Increased Five Basis Points to 1.36 Percent: In the second quarter, the Deposit Insurance Fund balance increased $4.4 billion to $145.3 billion. The reserve ratio increased 5 basis points during the quarter to 1.36 percent.\u00a0As of June 30, 2025, the reserve ratio exceeded the statutory minimum and, beginning with third quarter 2025, the FDIC will no longer be operating under the Restoration Plan.\nQuarterly Net Interest Margin Remained Relatively Unchanged from the Prior Quarter: The industry reported a quarterly increase in net interest income (up $2.9 billion, or 1.6 percent) as interest income increased more than interest expense. The net interest margin (NIM) was relatively flat, up by one basis point to 3.26 percent, which is above the pre-pandemic average of 3.25\u00a0percent. 1 The community bank NIM of 3.62 percent increased 16 basis points from the prior quarter, increasing for the fifth consecutive quarter and approaching the pre-pandemic average of 3.63 percent.\nAsset Quality Metrics Remained Generally Favorable, Though Weakness in Certain Portfolios Persisted: Past-due and nonaccrual (PDNA) loans, or loans that are 30 or more days past due or in nonaccrual status, fell 9 basis points from the prior quarter to 1.50 percent of total loans. The industry\u2019s PDNA ratio is still below the pre-pandemic average of 1.94 percent. While banks reported quarterly\u00a0decreases in PDNA of credit card loans (down $1.9 billion, or 24 basis points to 2.98 percent), and 1\u20134 family residential loans (down $1.5 billion, or 7 basis points to 1.86 percent), the PDNA rate for non-owner-occupied commercial real estate (CRE), multifamily CRE, and credit card portfolios remain well above their pre-pandemic averages.\nThe industry\u2019s net charge-off ratio of 0.60 percent decreased 6 basis points from the prior quarter and is 8 basis points lower than the year-ago quarter. This ratio is 12 basis points above the pre-pandemic average.\u00a0Most portfolios have\u00a0net charge-off\u00a0rates above their pre-pandemic averages.\nLoan Growth Accelerated from the Prior Quarter: Total loan and\u00a0lease balances increased $263.7 billion (2.1 percent) from the prior quarter. Loans to non-depository financial institutions (NDFIs) and loans to purchase or carry securities, including margin loans, had the largest dollar increase among loan types reported, though some of this increase was due to continued reclassifications following the finalization of changes to how certain loan products are reported. In addition, credit cards, adjustable-rate 1\u20134 family residential loans, and nonfarm nonresidential CRE contributed to the industry\u2019s quarterly loan growth.\u00a0The industry\u2019s annual rate of loan growth in the second quarter was 4 percent, below the pre-pandemic average of 4.9 percent.\nTotal loans at community banks increased 1.7 percent from the prior quarter and 4.9 percent from the prior year, led by increases in nonfarm nonresidential CRE loans and 1\u20134 family residential mortgage portfolios.\nDomestic Deposits Increased for the Fourth Consecutive Quarter: Domestic deposits increased $101.5 billion (0.6 percent) from first quarter 2025, rising for a fourth consecutive quarter. Estimated uninsured domestic deposits increased $186.4 billion (2.4 percent), offsetting a\u00a0$87.3 billion (0.8\u00a0percent) decline in\u00a0insured domestic deposits.\nThe Total Number of Insured Institutions Declined: The total number of FDIC-insured institutions declined by 41 during the second quarter to 4,421. During the quarter, two banks opened, one bank failed, five banks were sold to non-FDIC-insured institutions, and 37 institutions merged with other banks.\nLast Updated: August 26, 2025",

The FDIC entered into a purchase and assumption agreement with Coleman County State Bank of Coleman, Texas, to assume the insured deposits and some of the assets of the failed institution.\nThe Santa Anna National Bank\u2019s\u00a0sole office will reopen on Monday, June 30, 2025, as a branch of Coleman County State Bank. Depositors of the failed bank will automatically become depositors of Coleman County State Bank. The insured deposits assumed by Coleman County State Bank will continue to be insured by the FDIC so there is no need for customers to change their banking relationship to retain their deposit insurance coverage.\nAll Coleman County State Bank customers (formerly, The Santa Anna National Bank) will have access to their insured deposits and can write checks or use their ATM or debit cards up to their insured limits. Checks drawn on the bank will continue to be processed. Loan customers should continue to make their payments as usual.\nAs of June 18, 2025, The Santa Anna National Bank reported total assets of $63.8 million and total deposits of\u00a0$53.8 million. Approximately\u00a0$2.8 million of the deposits exceeded FDIC insurance limits, an amount that is likely to change once the FDIC obtains additional information from customers.

    "text": "WASHINGTON\u2014The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) today released the results of its latest Quarterly Banking Profile, a comprehensive summary of financial results based on reports from 4,421 insured commercial banks and savings institutions. In second quarter 2025, insured depository institutions reported a return on assets (ROA) ratio of 1.13 percent and aggregate net income of $69.9\u00a0billion, a decrease of $677.3 million (1 percent) from the prior quarter. Net income for the industry would have increased absent an increase in provision expenses related to a large bank acquisition.\nHighlights from the Second Quarter 2025 Quarterly Banking Profile\nNet Income Decreased from the Prior Quarter, Led by Higher Provision Expenses: For the 4,421 FDIC-insured commercial banks and savings institutions aggregate quarterly net income totaled $69.9\u00a0billion, down $677.3 million (1 percent) from the prior quarter.\u00a0The banking industry reported an aggregate ROA of 1.13 percent in second quarter 2025, down from 1.16 percent in first quarter 2025 and 1.20 percent in the year-ago quarter. The quarterly decrease in net income was driven by higher provision expenses (up $7.6 billion, or 33.7 percent). The increase in provision expense was largely attributable to the acquisition of one large bank, as accounting standards require the acquiring institution to recognize a provision expense related to certain acquired assets. Absent this large provision expense, net income would have increased due to higher net interest and noninterest income.\nCommunity Bank Net Income Increased from the Prior Quarter: Quarterly net income for the 3,982 community banks insured by the FDIC totaled $7.6 billion in the second quarter, an increase of $842.9\u00a0million (12.5 percent) from first quarter 2025. The community bank pretax ROA increased 15\u00a0basis points from the prior quarter to 1.33 percent. Higher net interest income (up $1.2\u00a0billion, 5.7\u00a0percent) and noninterest income (up $483.3 million, 10.1 percent) more than offset increases in noninterest expense (up $612.7 million, 3.5 percent) and provision expense (up $311.5\u00a0million, 29.2\u00a0percent).\nThe Deposit Insurance Fund Reserve Ratio Increased Five Basis Points to 1.36 Percent: In the second quarter, the Deposit Insurance Fund balance increased $4.4 billion to $145.3 billion. The reserve ratio increased 5 basis points during the quarter to 1.36 percent.\u00a0As of June 30, 2025, the reserve ratio exceeded the statutory minimum and, beginning with third quarter 2025, the FDIC will no longer be operating under the Restoration Plan.\nQuarterly Net Interest Margin Remained Relatively Unchanged from the Prior Quarter: The industry reported a quarterly increase in net interest income (up $2.9 billion, or 1.6 percent) as interest income increased more than interest expense. The net interest margin (NIM) was relatively flat, up by one basis point to 3.26 percent, which is above the pre-pandemic average of 3.25\u00a0percent. 1 The community bank NIM of 3.62 percent increased 16 basis points from the prior quarter, increasing for the fifth consecutive quarter and approaching the pre-pandemic average of 3.63 percent.\nAsset Quality Metrics Remained Generally Favorable, Though Weakness in Certain Portfolios Persisted: Past-due and nonaccrual (PDNA) loans, or loans that are 30 or more days past due or in nonaccrual status, fell 9 basis points from the prior quarter to 1.50 percent of total loans. The industry\u2019s PDNA ratio is still below the pre-pandemic average of 1.94 percent. While banks reported quarterly\u00a0decreases in PDNA of credit card loans (down $1.9 billion, or 24 basis points to 2.98 percent), and 1\u20134 family residential loans (down $1.5 billion, or 7 basis points to 1.86 percent), the PDNA rate for non-owner-occupied commercial real estate (CRE), multifamily CRE, and credit card portfolios remain well above their pre-pandemic averages.\nThe industry\u2019s net charge-off ratio of 0.60 percent decreased 6 basis points from the prior quarter and is 8 basis points lower than the year-ago quarter. This ratio is 12 basis points above the pre-pandemic average.\u00a0Most portfolios have\u00a0net charge-off\u00a0rates above their pre-pandemic averages.\nLoan Growth Accelerated from the Prior Quarter: Total loan and\u00a0lease balances increased $263.7 billion (2.1 percent) from the prior quarter. Loans to non-depository financial institutions (NDFIs) and loans to purchase or carry securities, including margin loans, had the largest dollar increase among loan types reported, though some of this increase was due to continued reclassifications following the finalization of changes to how certain loan products are reported. In addition, credit cards, adjustable-rate 1\u20134 family residential loans, and nonfarm nonresidential CRE contributed to the industry\u2019s quarterly loan growth.\u00a0The industry\u2019s annual rate of loan growth in the second quarter was 4 percent, below the pre-pandemic average of 4.9 percent.\nTotal loans at community banks increased 1.7 percent from the prior quarter and 4.9 percent from the prior year, led by increases in nonfarm nonresidential CRE loans and 1\u20134 family residential mortgage portfolios.\nDomestic Deposits Increased for the Fourth Consecutive Quarter: Domestic deposits increased $101.5 billion (0.6 percent) from first quarter 2025, rising for a fourth consecutive quarter. Estimated uninsured domestic deposits increased $186.4 billion (2.4 percent), offsetting a\u00a0$87.3 billion (0.8\u00a0percent) decline in\u00a0insured domestic deposits.\nThe Total Number of Insured Institutions Declined: The total number of FDIC-insured institutions declined by 41 during the second quarter to 4,421. During the quarter, two banks opened, one bank failed, five banks were sold to non-FDIC-insured institutions, and 37 institutions merged with other banks.\nLast Updated: August 26, 2025",

    "text": "WASHINGTON\u2014The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) today released the results of its latest Quarterly Banking Profile, a comprehensive summary of financial results based on reports from 4,421 insured commercial banks and savings institutions. In second quarter 2025, insured depository institutions reported a return on assets (ROA) ratio of 1.13 percent and aggregate net income of $69.9\u00a0billion, a decrease of $677.3 million (1 percent) from the prior quarter. Net income for the industry would have increased absent an increase in provision expenses related to a large bank acquisition.\nHighlights from the Second Quarter 2025 Quarterly Banking Profile\nNet Income Decreased from the Prior Quarter, Led by Higher Provision Expenses: For the 4,421 FDIC-insured commercial banks and savings institutions aggregate quarterly net income totaled $69.9\u00a0billion, down $677.3 million (1 percent) from the prior quarter.\u00a0The banking industry reported an aggregate ROA of 1.13 percent in second quarter 2025, down from 1.16 percent in first quarter 2025 and 1.20 percent in the year-ago quarter. The quarterly decrease in net income was driven by higher provision expenses (up $7.6 billion, or 33.7 percent). The increase in provision expense was largely attributable to the acquisition of one large bank, as accounting standards require the acquiring institution to recognize a provision expense related to certain acquired assets. Absent this large provision expense, net income would have increased due to higher net interest and noninterest income.\nCommunity Bank Net Income Increased from the Prior Quarter: Quarterly net income for the 3,982 community banks insured by the FDIC totaled $7.6 billion in the second quarter, an increase of $842.9\u00a0million (12.5 percent) from first quarter 2025. The community bank pretax ROA increased 15\u00a0basis points from the prior quarter to 1.33 percent. Higher net interest income (up $1.2\u00a0billion, 5.7\u00a0percent) and noninterest income (up $483.3 million, 10.1 percent) more than offset increases in noninterest expense (up $612.7 million, 3.5 percent) and provision expense (up $311.5\u00a0million, 29.2\u00a0percent).\nThe Deposit Insurance Fund Reserve Ratio Increased Five Basis Points to 1.36 Percent: In the second quarter, the Deposit Insurance Fund balance increased $4.4 billion to $145.3 billion. The reserve ratio increased 5 basis points during the quarter to 1.36 percent.\u00a0As of June 30, 2025, the reserve ratio exceeded the statutory minimum and, beginning with third quarter 2025, the FDIC will no longer be operating under the Restoration Plan.\nQuarterly Net Interest Margin Remained Relatively Unchanged from the Prior Quarter: The industry reported a quarterly increase in net interest income (up $2.9 billion, or 1.6 percent) as interest income increased more than interest expense. The net interest margin (NIM) was relatively flat, up by one basis point to 3.26 percent, which is above the pre-pandemic average of 3.25\u00a0percent. 1 The community bank NIM of 3.62 percent increased 16 basis points from the prior quarter, increasing for the fifth consecutive quarter and approaching the pre-pandemic average of 3.63 percent.\nAsset Quality Metrics Remained Generally Favorable, Though Weakness in Certain Portfolios Persisted: Past-due and nonaccrual (PDNA) loans, or loans that are 30 or more days past due or in nonaccrual status, fell 9 basis points from the prior quarter to 1.50 percent of total loans. The industry\u2019s PDNA ratio is still below the pre-pandemic average of 1.94 percent. While banks reported quarterly\u00a0decreases in PDNA of credit card loans (down $1.9 billion, or 24 basis points to 2.98 percent), and 1\u20134 family residential loans (down $1.5 billion, or 7 basis points to 1.86 percent), the PDNA rate for non-owner-occupied commercial real estate (CRE), multifamily CRE, and credit card portfolios remain well above their pre-pandemic averages.\nThe industry\u2019s net charge-off ratio of 0.60 percent decreased 6 basis points from the prior quarter and is 8 basis points lower than the year-ago quarter. This ratio is 12 basis points above the pre-pandemic average.\u00a0Most portfolios have\u00a0net charge-off\u00a0rates above their pre-pandemic averages.\nLoan Growth Accelerated from the Prior Quarter: Total loan and\u00a0lease balances increased $263.7 billion (2.1 percent) from the prior quarter. Loans to non-depository financial institutions (NDFIs) and loans to purchase or carry securities, including margin loans, had the largest dollar increase among loan types reported, though some of this increase was due to continued reclassifications following the finalization of changes to how certain loan products are reported. In addition, credit cards, adjustable-rate 1\u20134 family residential loans, and nonfarm nonresidential CRE contributed to the industry\u2019s quarterly loan growth.\u00a0The industry\u2019s annual rate of loan growth in the second quarter was 4 percent, below the pre-pandemic average of 4.9 percent.\nTotal loans at community banks increased 1.7 percent from the prior quarter and 4.9 percent from the prior year, led by increases in nonfarm nonresidential CRE loans and 1\u20134 family residential mortgage portfolios.\nDomestic Deposits Increased for the Fourth Consecutive Quarter: Domestic deposits increased $101.5 billion (0.6 percent) from first quarter 2025, rising for a fourth consecutive quarter. Estimated uninsured domestic deposits increased $186.4 billion (2.4 percent), offsetting a\u00a0$87.3 billion (0.8\u00a0percent) decline in\u00a0insured domestic deposits.\nThe Total Number of Insured Institutions Declined: The total number of FDIC-insured institutions declined by 41 during the second quarter to 4,421. During the quarter, two banks opened, one bank failed, five banks were sold to non-FDIC-insured institutions, and 37 institutions merged with other banks.\nLast Updated: August 26, 2025",

Depositors of the failed bank will automatically become depositors of Coleman County State Bank. The insured deposits assumed by Coleman County State Bank will continue to be insured by the FDIC so there is no need for customers to change their banking relationship to retain their deposit insurance coverage.\nAll Coleman County State Bank customers (formerly, The Santa Anna National Bank) will have access to their insured deposits and can write checks or use their ATM or debit cards up to their insured limits. Checks drawn on the bank will continue to be processed. Loan customers should continue to make their payments as usual.\nAs of June 18, 2025, The Santa Anna National Bank reported total assets of $63.8 million and total deposits of\u00a0$53.8 million. Approximately\u00a0$2.8 million of the deposits exceeded FDIC insurance limits, an amount that is likely to change once the FDIC obtains additional information from customers. Once further information is available, the FDIC will consider whether to provide uninsured depositors an advance dividend (i.e. access to a portion of their uninsured funds) and will provide more information at that time.\nCustomers with accounts greater than $250,000 should contact the FDIC toll-free at 1-866-314-1744 to set up an appointment to discuss their deposits.

The FDIC will retain a large portion of the assets of The Santa Anna National Bank for later disposition. The FDIC preliminarily estimates that the failure will cost its Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) about $23.7 million. This loss estimate will change over time as the assets are sold. Suspected fraud contributed to the failure of the bank and estimated cost to the DIF.\nThe Santa Anna National Bank is the second bank to fail in the nation this year. The last bank failure was Pulaski Savings Bank of Chicago on January 17, 2025. The last failure in Texas was The Enloe State Bank of Cooper, Texas on May 31, 2019.\nLast Updated: June 27, 2025",

    "text": "WASHINGTON\u2014The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) today released the results of its latest Quarterly Banking Profile, a comprehensive summary of financial results based on reports from 4,421 insured commercial banks and savings institutions. In second quarter 2025, insured depository institutions reported a return on assets (ROA) ratio of 1.13 percent and aggregate net income of $69.9\u00a0billion, a decrease of $677.3 million (1 percent) from the prior quarter. Net income for the industry would have increased absent an increase in provision expenses related to a large bank acquisition.\nHighlights from the Second Quarter 2025 Quarterly Banking Profile\nNet Income Decreased from the Prior Quarter, Led by Higher Provision Expenses: For the 4,421 FDIC-insured commercial banks and savings institutions aggregate quarterly net income totaled $69.9\u00a0billion, down $677.3 million (1 percent) from the prior quarter.\u00a0The banking industry reported an aggregate ROA of 1.13 percent in second quarter 2025, down from 1.16 percent in first quarter 2025 and 1.20 percent in the year-ago quarter. The quarterly decrease in net income was driven by higher provision expenses (up $7.6 billion, or 33.7 percent). The increase in provision expense was largely attributable to the acquisition of one large bank, as accounting standards require the acquiring institution to recognize a provision expense related to certain acquired assets. Absent this large provision expense, net income would have increased due to higher net interest and noninterest income.\nCommunity Bank Net Income Increased from the Prior Quarter: Quarterly net income for the 3,982 community banks insured by the FDIC totaled $7.6 billion in the second quarter, an increase of $842.9\u00a0million (12.5 percent) from first quarter 2025. The community bank pretax ROA increased 15\u00a0basis points from the prior quarter to 1.33 percent. Higher net interest income (up $1.2\u00a0billion, 5.7\u00a0percent) and noninterest income (up $483.3 million, 10.1 percent) more than offset increases in noninterest expense (up $612.7 million, 3.5 percent) and provision expense (up $311.5\u00a0million, 29.2\u00a0percent).\nThe Deposit Insurance Fund Reserve Ratio Increased Five Basis Points to 1.36 Percent: In the second quarter, the Deposit Insurance Fund balance increased $4.4 billion to $145.3 billion. The reserve ratio increased 5 basis points during the quarter to 1.36 percent.\u00a0As of June 30, 2025, the reserve ratio exceeded the statutory minimum and, beginning with third quarter 2025, the FDIC will no longer be operating under the Restoration Plan.\nQuarterly Net Interest Margin Remained Relatively Unchanged from the Prior Quarter: The industry reported a quarterly increase in net interest income (up $2.9 billion, or 1.6 percent) as interest income increased more than interest expense. The net interest margin (NIM) was relatively flat, up by one basis point to 3.26 percent, which is above the pre-pandemic average of 3.25\u00a0percent. 1 The community bank NIM of 3.62 percent increased 16 basis points from the prior quarter, increasing for the fifth consecutive quarter and approaching the pre-pandemic average of 3.63 percent.\nAsset Quality Metrics Remained Generally Favorable, Though Weakness in Certain Portfolios Persisted: Past-due and nonaccrual (PDNA) loans, or loans that are 30 or more days past due or in nonaccrual status, fell 9 basis points from the prior quarter to 1.50 percent of total loans. The industry\u2019s PDNA ratio is still below the pre-pandemic average of 1.94 percent. While banks reported quarterly\u00a0decreases in PDNA of credit card loans (down $1.9 billion, or 24 basis points to 2.98 percent), and 1\u20134 family residential loans (down $1.5 billion, or 7 basis points to 1.86 percent), the PDNA rate for non-owner-occupied commercial real estate (CRE), multifamily CRE, and credit card portfolios remain well above their pre-pandemic averages.\nThe industry\u2019s net charge-off ratio of 0.60 percent decreased 6 basis points from the prior quarter and is 8 basis points lower than the year-ago quarter. This ratio is 12 basis points above the pre-pandemic average.\u00a0Most portfolios have\u00a0net charge-off\u00a0rates above their pre-pandemic averages.\nLoan Growth Accelerated from the Prior Quarter: Total loan and\u00a0lease balances increased $263.7 billion (2.1 percent) from the prior quarter. Loans to non-depository financial institutions (NDFIs) and loans to purchase or carry securities, including margin loans, had the largest dollar increase among loan types reported, though some of this increase was due to continued reclassifications following the finalization of changes to how certain loan products are reported. In addition, credit cards, adjustable-rate 1\u20134 family residential loans, and nonfarm nonresidential CRE contributed to the industry\u2019s quarterly loan growth.\u00a0The industry\u2019s annual rate of loan growth in the second quarter was 4 percent, below the pre-pandemic average of 4.9 percent.\nTotal loans at community banks increased 1.7 percent from the prior quarter and 4.9 percent from the prior year, led by increases in nonfarm nonresidential CRE loans and 1\u20134 family residential mortgage portfolios.\nDomestic Deposits Increased for the Fourth Consecutive Quarter: Domestic deposits increased $101.5 billion (0.6 percent) from first quarter 2025, rising for a fourth consecutive quarter. Estimated uninsured domestic deposits increased $186.4 billion (2.4 percent), offsetting a\u00a0$87.3 billion (0.8\u00a0percent) decline in\u00a0insured domestic deposits.\nThe Total Number of Insured Institutions Declined: The total number of FDIC-insured institutions declined by 41 during the second quarter to 4,421. During the quarter, two banks opened, one bank failed, five banks were sold to non-FDIC-insured institutions, and 37 institutions merged with other banks.\nLast Updated: August 26, 2025",

    "text": "WASHINGTON\u2014The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) today released the results of its latest Quarterly Banking Profile, a comprehensive summary of financial results based on reports from 4,421 insured commercial banks and savings institutions. In second quarter 2025, insured depository institutions reported a return on assets (ROA) ratio of 1.13 percent and aggregate net income of $69.9\u00a0billion, a decrease of $677.3 million (1 percent) from the prior quarter. Net income for the industry would have increased absent an increase in provision expenses related to a large bank acquisition.\nHighlights from the Second Quarter 2025 Quarterly Banking Profile\nNet Income Decreased from the Prior Quarter, Led by Higher Provision Expenses: For the 4,421 FDIC-insured commercial banks and savings institutions aggregate quarterly net income totaled $69.9\u00a0billion, down $677.3 million (1 percent) from the prior quarter.\u00a0The banking industry reported an aggregate ROA of 1.13 percent in second quarter 2025, down from 1.16 percent in first quarter 2025 and 1.20 percent in the year-ago quarter. The quarterly decrease in net income was driven by higher provision expenses (up $7.6 billion, or 33.7 percent). The increase in provision expense was largely attributable to the acquisition of one large bank, as accounting standards require the acquiring institution to recognize a provision expense related to certain acquired assets. Absent this large provision expense, net income would have increased due to higher net interest and noninterest income.\nCommunity Bank Net Income Increased from the Prior Quarter: Quarterly net income for the 3,982 community banks insured by the FDIC totaled $7.6 billion in the second quarter, an increase of $842.9\u00a0million (12.5 percent) from first quarter 2025. The community bank pretax ROA increased 15\u00a0basis points from the prior quarter to 1.33 percent. Higher net interest income (up $1.2\u00a0billion, 5.7\u00a0percent) and noninterest income (up $483.3 million, 10.1 percent) more than offset increases in noninterest expense (up $612.7 million, 3.5 percent) and provision expense (up $311.5\u00a0million, 29.2\u00a0percent).\nThe Deposit Insurance Fund Reserve Ratio Increased Five Basis Points to 1.36 Percent: In the second quarter, the Deposit Insurance Fund balance increased $4.4 billion to $145.3 billion. The reserve ratio increased 5 basis points during the quarter to 1.36 percent.\u00a0As of June 30, 2025, the reserve ratio exceeded the statutory minimum and, beginning with third quarter 2025, the FDIC will no longer be operating under the Restoration Plan.\nQuarterly Net Interest Margin Remained Relatively Unchanged from the Prior Quarter: The industry reported a quarterly increase in net interest income (up $2.9 billion, or 1.6 percent) as interest income increased more than interest expense. The net interest margin (NIM) was relatively flat, up by one basis point to 3.26 percent, which is above the pre-pandemic average of 3.25\u00a0percent. 1 The community bank NIM of 3.62 percent increased 16 basis points from the prior quarter, increasing for the fifth consecutive quarter and approaching the pre-pandemic average of 3.63 percent.\nAsset Quality Metrics Remained Generally Favorable, Though Weakness in Certain Portfolios Persisted: Past-due and nonaccrual (PDNA) loans, or loans that are 30 or more days past due or in nonaccrual status, fell 9 basis points from the prior quarter to 1.50 percent of total loans. The industry\u2019s PDNA ratio is still below the pre-pandemic average of 1.94 percent. While banks reported quarterly\u00a0decreases in PDNA of credit card loans (down $1.9 billion, or 24 basis points to 2.98 percent), and 1\u20134 family residential loans (down $1.5 billion, or 7 basis points to 1.86 percent), the PDNA rate for non-owner-occupied commercial real estate (CRE), multifamily CRE, and credit card portfolios remain well above their pre-pandemic averages.\nThe industry\u2019s net charge-off ratio of 0.60 percent decreased 6 basis points from the prior quarter and is 8 basis points lower than the year-ago quarter. This ratio is 12 basis points above the pre-pandemic average.\u00a0Most portfolios have\u00a0net charge-off\u00a0rates above their pre-pandemic averages.\nLoan Growth Accelerated from the Prior Quarter: Total loan and\u00a0lease balances increased $263.7 billion (2.1 percent) from the prior quarter. Loans to non-depository financial institutions (NDFIs) and loans to purchase or carry securities, including margin loans, had the largest dollar increase among loan types reported, though some of this increase was due to continued reclassifications following the finalization of changes to how certain loan products are reported. In addition, credit cards, adjustable-rate 1\u20134 family residential loans, and nonfarm nonresidential CRE contributed to the industry\u2019s quarterly loan growth.\u00a0The industry\u2019s annual rate of loan growth in the second quarter was 4 percent, below the pre-pandemic average of 4.9 percent.\nTotal loans at community banks increased 1.7 percent from the prior quarter and 4.9 percent from the prior year, led by increases in nonfarm nonresidential CRE loans and 1\u20134 family residential mortgage portfolios.\nDomestic Deposits Increased for the Fourth Consecutive Quarter: Domestic deposits increased $101.5 billion (0.6 percent) from first quarter 2025, rising for a fourth consecutive quarter. Estimated uninsured domestic deposits increased $186.4 billion (2.4 percent), offsetting a\u00a0$87.3 billion (0.8\u00a0percent) decline in\u00a0insured domestic deposits.\nThe Total Number of Insured Institutions Declined: The total number of FDIC-insured institutions declined by 41 during the second quarter to 4,421. During the quarter, two banks opened, one bank failed, five banks were sold to non-FDIC-insured institutions, and 37 institutions merged with other banks.\nLast Updated: August 26, 2025",

Depositors of the failed bank will automatically become depositors of Coleman County State Bank. The insured deposits assumed by Coleman County State Bank will continue to be insured by the FDIC so there is no need for customers to change their banking relationship to retain their deposit insurance coverage.\nAll Coleman County State Bank customers (formerly, The Santa Anna National Bank) will have access to their insured deposits and can write checks or use their ATM or debit cards up to their insured limits. Checks drawn on the bank will continue to be processed. Loan customers should continue to make their payments as usual.\nAs of June 18, 2025, The Santa Anna National Bank reported total assets of $63.8 million and total deposits of\u00a0$53.8 million. Approximately\u00a0$2.8 million of the deposits exceeded FDIC insurance limits, an amount that is likely to change once the FDIC obtains additional information from customers. Once further information is available, the FDIC will consider whether to provide uninsured depositors an advance dividend (i.e. access to a portion of their uninsured funds) and will provide more information at that time.\nCustomers with accounts greater than $250,000 should contact the FDIC toll-free at 1-866-314-1744 to set up an appointment to discuss their deposits. This phone number will be operational this evening until 9:00 p.m., Central Time (CT); on Saturday from 9:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m., CT; on Sunday from 12:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m., CT; Monday from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m., CT; and thereafter from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., CT.\nCustomers who would like more information on today\u2019s transaction can call the toll-free number or visit the FDIC\u2019s website .\u00a0Beginning Monday, depositors of The Santa Anna National Bank with more than $250,000 in deposits may visit the FDIC\u2019s webpage \u201cIs My Account Fully Insured?\u201d to determine their insurance coverage.\nColeman County State Bank agreed to assume the insured deposits for a\u00a05.16 percent premium. The FDIC will retain a large portion of the assets of The Santa Anna National Bank for later disposition. The FDIC preliminarily estimates that the failure will cost its Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) about $23.7 million. This loss estimate will change over time as the assets are sold. Suspected fraud contributed to the failure of the bank and estimated cost to the DIF.\nThe Santa Anna National Bank is the second bank to fail in the nation this year. The last bank failure was Pulaski Savings Bank of Chicago on January 17, 2025. The last failure in Texas was The Enloe State Bank of Cooper, Texas on May 31, 2019.\nLast Updated: June 27, 2025",
