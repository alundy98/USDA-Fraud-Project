This Python project scrapes articles from the FDIC website related to fraud, scams, and deceptive practices. It automatically extracts the article title, URL, full publication date, year, and the article text from both HTML pages and PDFs. Articles older than 10 years are automatically ignored. The results are saved to a CSV file (final.csv) for easy analysis or further processing. The scraper uses requests, BeautifulSoup, pdfplumber, and regular expressions to handle varied date formats and document types.
