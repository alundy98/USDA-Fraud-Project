Transactions
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is issuing guidance to ensure that supervised
institutions are aware of the consumer compliance risks associated with charging an overdraft fee
on a transaction that was authorized against a positive balance but settled against a negative
balance, a practice commonly referred to as “Authorize Positive, Settle Negative” (APSN). The
FDIC previously identified concerns with this practice in its June 2019 Consumer Compliance
Supervisory Highlights.1 This guidance expands on the 2019 Supervisory Highlights article by
discussing the FDIC’s concerns with both the available and ledger balance methods used by
institutions when assessing overdraft fees. This guidance also clarifies that disclosures
describing transaction processing may not mitigate these concerns.
Background
Overdraft programs, transaction clearing, and settlement processes are complex. In the case of
APSN transactions, which involve consumers being assessed overdraft fees for transactions
where they had sufficient account balances at the time the transactions were initiated, it may not
be possible for consumers to determine when fees will be assessed and how they may be
avoided.
Financial institutions’ processing systems generally use either a ledger balance method2 or an
available balance method,3 including for the purpose of assessing overdraft-related fees. An
account’s available balance may be impacted by pending debit transactions.4 Some banks assess
overdraft fees on debit card transactions that authorize when a customer’s available balance is
positive but later post to a customer’s account when their balance is negative. In this scenario, a
customer’s account has a sufficient available balance to cover a debit card transaction when the
transaction is authorized but, due to one or more intervening transactions, has an insufficient
balance to cover the transaction at the time it settles.5
In addition to assessing an overdraft fee on the APSN transaction, some banks also assess
overdraft fees on intervening transactions that exceed the customer’s account balance. In this
1 Consumer Compliance Supervisory Highlights (June 2019).
2 A ledger balance method calculates the account balance based only on transactions settled during the relevant
period and does not take into account authorization holds. This method typically correlates to the balance reflected
on a consumer’s periodic statement.
3 An available balance method calculates the account balance based on authorized (but not settled) transactions the
financial institution is obligated to pay under contractual or other obligations, as well as settled transactions and
pending deposits. The available balance is generally the amount of money/funds the consumer can access because it
accounts for any pending debit or credit transactions. This balance typically correlates to the balance accessible to
consumers online, through a mobile application, at an ATM, or by phone.
4 This type of authorization hold is sometimes referred to as a debit hold, a temporary debit authorization hold, or a
preauthorization.
5 Refer to Table 1 in the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s Consumer Financial Protection Circular 2022-06,
“Unanticipated overdraft fee assessment practices” (Oct. 26, 2022) (CFPB Circular 2022-06).
1
scenario, for example, the bank reduces a customer’s balance to account for the initial authorized
debit card transaction, and subsequently, an intervening transaction further reduces the
customer’s available balance so that the account no longer has a sufficient balance. The bank
charges an overdraft fee on both the intervening transaction and the initial APSN transaction
when posted to the customer’s account.6
During consumer compliance examinations, the FDIC has determined that certain overdraft
practices related to APSN transactions were unfair.
Potential Risks
Failure to take steps to avoid assessing overdraft-related fees when transactions are authorized on
positive balances but settle on negative balances results in heightened risks of violations of
Section 1036(a)(1)(B) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of
2010 (12 U.S.C. § 5536(a)(1)(B)), which prohibits any covered person or service provider from
engaging in any unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices in connection with a consumer
financial product or service (Dodd-Frank UDAAP) and Section 5 of the Federal Trade
Commission (FTC) Act, which prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices (FTC UDAP).7
The FDIC applies the same standards as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and
FTC in determining whether an act or practice is unfair under the respective statutes. An act or
practice is unfair when it (1) causes or is likely to cause substantial injury to consumers, (2)
cannot be reasonably avoided by consumers, and (3) is not outweighed by countervailing
benefits to consumers or to competition. Public policy may also be considered in the analysis of
whether a particular act or practice is unfair.
Unanticipated and unavoidable overdraft fees can cause substantial injury to consumers. A
consumer is likely to suffer injury when charged more overdraft fees than may have been
anticipated based on the consumer’s actual spending. While not all overdraft fees may be
attributable to APSN transactions, the likely presence of intervening transactions may cause
additional injury.
The consumer cannot reasonably avoid the injury because the consumer does not have the ability
to effectively control payment systems and overdraft processing systems practices. Due to the
complicated nature of overdraft processing systems and payment system complexities outside the
consumer’s control, consumers may be unable to avoid injury. Additionally, in some cases, the
institutions’ methodology for assessing overdraft fees on APSN transactions resulted in
unanticipated and unavoidable overdraft fees that were not outweighed by a countervailing
benefit to consumers or competition. Dodd-Frank UDAAP and FTC UDAP risks exist in both
available balance and ledger balance methods of assessing overdraft fees, but may be more
pronounced in situations where institutions use available balance methods. For example, the use
of available balance to assess overdraft fees may exacerbate the injury, as temporary holds may
6 Refer to Table 2 in CFPB Circular 2022-06.
7 For information on how the authorize positive, settle negative practices relate to the Dodd-Frank Act’s prohibition
on unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices, refer to the CFPB Circular 2022-06. Nothing in this guidance
should be read as inconsistent or in conflict with the CFPB Circular in the application of Dodd-Frank UDAAP.

lead to consumers being assessed multiple overdraft fees when they may have reasonably
expected only one.
Risk Mitigation Practices
Institutions are encouraged to review their practices regarding the charging of overdraft fees on
APSN transactions to ensure customers are not charged overdraft fees for transactions consumers
may not anticipate or avoid.
Third parties often play significant roles in processing transactions, identifying and tracking
balances at the time of authorization, and providing systems that determine when overdraft
fees are assessed. Institutions should ensure overdraft programs provided by third parties are
compliant with all applicable laws and regulations. Such third-party arrangements may present
risks if not properly managed by financial institution management. Institutions are
encouraged to review these third party arrangements, as institutions are expected to maintain
adequate oversight of third-party activities and appropriate quality control over products and
services provided through third-party arrangements.8 Institutions are also encouraged to
review and understand the risks presented from third-party system settings for overdraft-related
fees, as well as understand the capabilities of their core processing system(s), such as identifying
and tracking transactions authorized on a positive balance but settled on a negative balance and
maintaining data on such transactions. Some third parties offer data processing system
enhancements aimed at preventing overdraft-related fees from being charged for a transaction
when a debit hold authorizes against a positive balance. Note that some third parties may offer
these enhancements as optional or require client financial institutions to take action in order to
implement them.
In addition, institutions are also generally encouraged to review disclosures and account
agreements to ensure the financial institution’s practices for charging any fees on deposit
accounts are communicated accurately, clearly, and consistently. However, disclosures generally
do not fully address Dodd-Frank UDAAP and FTC UDAP risks associated with APSN
transactions and related overdraft fees.

Docket ID OCC-2025-0009
Benjamin W. McDonough
Deputy Secretary, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
Docket No. OP-1866
Jennifer M. Jones
Deputy Executive Secretary, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
RIN 3064-ZA49
Dear Mr. Gould, Mr. McDonough, and Ms. Jones:
I am the President/CEO of Wayne County Bank (Bank), a $568MM community bank
located in Waynesboro, TN. I am writing to respond to the Office of the Comptroller of
the Currency (OCC)’s, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board)’s, and
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)’s request for information (RFI) on
payments fraud.
Wayne County Bank is a community bank based in Waynesboro, TN. Founded in 1914,
we’ve grown to $568MM in total assets and 8 locations throughout 3 counties. We offer a
full suite of banking products and services, including a variety of deposit accounts and
personal and business loan products. Our core focus is small business loans (SBL),
which are loans to SBs and farms for C&I activities and Ag.
Wayne County Bank takes pride in still having the friendly personal touch that has been
our hallmark when we began in 1914. Today, our staff still know most of their customers
on a first name basis, and the bank is stronger and more secure than ever. We pride
ourselves on our personalized approach to community banking and our commitment to
and deep roots in the communities that we serve.
I applaud the agencies for issuing this RFI and seeking input on ways that the OCC, the
Federal Reserve System (FRS), and the FDIC could take actions to help consumers,
businesses, and financial institutions mitigate payments fraud. Community banks
continue to be challenged by a rise in fraud and scams across payment types, so agency
action is much needed.
Specifically, the Bank has been affected by payments fraud in the following ways:
•
Person-to-Person transfers reported as fraudulent where the bank has to recourse
and must assume the loss.
•
Mobile Deposits where funds are withdrawn from ATM.
•
ATM Deposits that are not valid checks but may have been done after hours and
funds were withdrawn before the check(s) could be reviewed.
•
Gift Card purchases where customers send fraudsters the code and they claim the
funds.
•
Digital Currency ATMs where cash is converted to a Digital Currency.
External Collaboration
The Bank supports collaborative stakeholder efforts to address payments fraud.
Fraud and scams persist across state borders, so national stakeholder
collaboration is necessary to effectively combat the problem. However, national
efforts must recognize the resource constraints individual community banks face
when deciding whether to participate.
•
Local and regional collaboration across community banks, federal and state
regulators, law enforcement, community organizations, and other stakeholders
can be an effective way to build connections and share information at the
community level.
Consumer, Business, and Industry Education
•
Community banks thrive, in part, because of their close customer relationships, so
face-to-face engagement is one of the most effective tools to reach community
bank customers. In-branch material and messaging is especially valuable for
community banks.
•
Community banks serve elderly customers, as well as consumers and small
businesses in rural and agricultural areas, so educational materials tailored to
these groups would be valuable. Some community banks are in areas that do not
have widespread, reliable Internet access, so web-based resources are not always
accessible to customers.
Regulation and Supervision
•
Broadly speaking, payments fraud regulations and examiner expectations need to
be appropriately tailored to community banks with tiered compliance
requirements and deadlines. There are opportunities to enhance supervisory
guidance around appropriate controls, suitable technology, reporting, and
incident response, but it is important to avoid imposing new burdens on
community banks.
•
Changes to Regulation CC could help community banks prevent and mitigate
check fraud. For example, the return deadline related to fraud could be extended,
the “reasonable cause to doubt collectability” exception could be clarified, and
relevant definitions could be revised (e.g., “altered” and “alteration”). However,
hold times should not be shortened; they are an essential tool for banks to detect
and prevent check fraud. Financial institutions should have flexibility to extend
hold times under appropriate circumstances.
Payments Fraud Data Collection and Information Sharing
•
While centralized data reporting would be valuable for the ecosystem, agencies
should avoid imposing additional data collection requirements on community
banks. Appropriate safe harbors would improve banks’ ability and willingness to
share fraud data.
•
Community banks would benefit from automated data collection, analysis, and
reporting tools that are integrated with services they already use and do not come
with additional costs.
Reserve Banks’ Operator Tools and Services
•
Community banks would benefit from tools and services that integrate with third-
party services they already use and pricing that is appropriate for their size and
complexity.
•
There are a variety of specific products and services that could benefit community
banks, including, for example, a fraud contact directory, a fraud information
sharing repository, an interbank check fraud breach of warranty claim mechanism,
a check image analysis and verification tool, an atypical payment monitoring
service, and confirmation of payee service.
General Questions
•
Person to Person (P2P) Payments where a customer may be coerced into sending
a payment to a fraudster in relation to back taxes, financial assistance, investment
opportunities, ect. These payments are reported to the bank as fraud and the Bank
does not have recourse to recoup these funds due to the payment network type
and being consumer initiated. Fraudsters have also coerced customers into
allowing access into their personal devices in which they may assume control and
initiate a payment themselves while the customer is not fully aware of what is
happening.
•
Mobile Deposit Scams are an increasing issue with customers attempting to get
online loans, employment, and investment opportunities. Fraudsters are
presenting as Loan Companies, Employers, and Investors that require Online
Banking credentials in order to make a “Direct Deposit” to a customers account.
These types of deposits are typically checks that have been stolen from the mail
and reproduced with altered information or generically created that may look
legitimate at first glance.
•
ATM Deposits have started to arise shortly after the Mobile Deposit scams. These
are deposit that are typically not valid checks but may have been done after hours
and funds were withdrawn before the check(s) could be reviewed. Fraudsters may
use a variety of methods, similar to Mobile Deposit Scams, and inform customers
they should go after hours or not to discuss details with their Financial Institutions.
They will attempt to manipulate the customer into believing that the bank is
against them and it is better to use the ATMs.
•
“Love Scams” where Fraudsters manipulate and convince customers (primarily
targeted at the elderly) that they are in love with them and need money to get to
them or for a family emergency. Often Fraudsters will impersonate celebrities and
have been utilizing AI to generate realistic pictures and voice calls. Payment
methods such as wires, P2P Transfers, and Gift Card purchases are utilized. The
customers are willingly sending these payments and cannot reclaim their funds.
The
•
We have employed internal controls and reviews with personnel versed in Fraud
Management. Training is provided in relation to these controls and reviews, as well
as effective communication regarding newly trending scams and current instances
of scams we personally see.
•
Frontline personnel are trained to pay attention to their customers and the
deposit. Making a friendly approach to a customer and efforts to know customers
has proven to be beneficial for detecting fraud.
Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments on this RFI. The Bank looks forward
to continuing to work with the OCC, FRS, and FDIC, and other stakeholders to protect
our customers and communities from the growing threat of payments fraud.
Sincerely,
/s/

550 17th Street NW
Washington,(cid:3)DC 20429
Dear Ms. Jones,(cid:3)Mr. McDonough, and Mr. Gould:(cid:3)(cid:3)
My name is Tiffany Baer Paine from Security Bank USA in Bemidji,(cid:3)MN. We(cid:3)are a $250MM bank(cid:3)in a small(cid:3)(cid:3)
town in Northern MN.(cid:3)(cid:3)
Unfortunately, this is going to be(cid:3)a record year for us when it comes to(cid:3)fraud losses. We have(cid:3)(cid:3)
experienced Check(cid:3)Fraud, ACH Fraud, Debit Card Fraud,(cid:3)attempted(cid:3)Wire Fraud and(cid:3)a BIN attack.(cid:3)As(cid:3)you(cid:3)(cid:3)
can imagine,(cid:3)this has created stress on our limited resources.(cid:3)(cid:3)
 We have purchased software and added staff.(cid:3)(cid:3)
 We and are(cid:3)planning to(cid:3)add more staff to monitor / mitigate(cid:3)risk for(cid:3)the(cid:3)bank and our customers.(cid:3)(cid:3)
 We regularly communicate with our customers(cid:3)to(cid:3)help educate them on fraud(cid:3)and(cid:3)how to protect(cid:3)(cid:3)
themselves.(cid:3)(cid:3)
o Ultimately, the customer is inconvenienced but not out any money. This does(cid:3)not create(cid:3)(cid:3)
as much urgency on their part.(cid:3)(cid:3)
The following is(cid:3)a breakdown of some(cid:3)opportunities for action as I see it:(cid:3)(cid:3)
(cid:33061) Joint Opportunities (OCC, FRS, FDIC Collectively)(cid:3)(cid:3)
1. Unified(cid:3)Fraud Reporting and Monitoring Framework(cid:3)(cid:3)
1

prevent them (e.g., scams in instant payments).(cid:3)(cid:3)
4. Encourage Adoption of Secure Standards(cid:3)(cid:3)
 Support transition to:(cid:3)(cid:3)
o Image-based check clearing with fraud detection overlays.(cid:3)(cid:3)
o ISO 20022 for richer payment data and better fraud screening.(cid:3)(cid:3)
o Secure(cid:3)instant(cid:3)payment platforms(cid:3)(e.g., FedNow, RTP) with built-in fraud mitigation.(cid:3)(cid:3)
(cid:35538)(cid:35534)(cid:35535)(cid:35536)(cid:35537) OCC-Specific Opportunities(cid:3)(cid:3)

 Encourage supervised banks to adopt AI/ML fraud detection systems and anomaly-based alerting
for wire(cid:3)and(cid:3)ACH(cid:3)payments.(cid:3)(cid:3)
(cid:35442)(cid:35443)(cid:35444) Federal(cid:3)Reserve System (FRS)-Specific Opportunities(cid:3)(cid:3)

""Prime"" Bank Instruments Spreading
Two scams are spreading across the United States and internationally: one playing on
the ambition to be debt free; and the other to receive a high rate of return on an
investment.
While the frauds should be obvious, they continue to trap unsuspecting bankers,
would-be investors and gullible consumers.
The first scheme involves ""certified money orders"" being sold by groups that dismiss
currency laws as unconstitutional. These bogus money orders are being sold to buyers
who are told they can be used to erase debt. A bank is instructed to mail the money
orders to an address, but is never paid. The number is growing, but an estimated 100 to
500 banks have already received the bogus money orders.
The second scheme involves ""prime"" bank financial instruments and has spread
around the world. Federal regulatory agencies have warned bankers to avoid
transactions involving these bogus ""prime"" bank financial instruments.
The articles below advise bankers on what to look for, and what to do.

Outline
• Overview: evidence about impact of defaults
and demographics on making right choice
• Background: Fraud case leads to same choice
under 3 exogenously assigned choice structures
• Regression Discontinuity: Poor defaults causes
60+% of the population to make errors
• Hazard: Low SES neighborhoods less
responsive to enrollment-by-default letters; quit
more when charged
• Welfare effects: Cancellation default saves
$400+ relative to 2 observed alternatives
• Conclusion
We observe who makes the
choice right under 3 structures
• Exiting is the right choice: Fraud
enrolled people in (nearly) useless
subscriptions that charged until they quit
• Lawsuit creates exogenous variation in
defaults and decision structure
– Enrolled <5 months: Cancellation default
– Enrolled >5 months: Enrollment default
Direct evidence that bad defaults cause (many) mistakes.
Quit rate before and after transition to cancellation default
Demographics interact with decision
structure when enrollment is the default
• Observe enrollment as default. When
people from less wealthy/educated
neighborhoods get:
– charges they are more likely to exit
– letters they are less likely to exit
• Making cancellation the default could save
$400 per subscriber

Suntasia used deceptive phone
calls to enroll ~750,000 customers
• Phone calls:
– Claimed to represent bank
– Offered “free” reward
– Read routing number; asked consumer to
“verify” their checking account number
– Enrolled customers in up to 3 subscriptions
that charged every 30 days until they quit
– Avg. charges to checking account >$200.
Almost no one used the firm’s costly products
The firms’ subscriptions
We drop everyone we see using these subscriptions
The subscriptions had no

• Buyers club:
– Can claim rebates after cancelling;
– Other discounts available general public.
• 2.2% of long distance customers used
program; delayed start rare
• Credit catalog: implicit interest rate

• Cancelling is almost always the right
choice
Multiple sources quite critical of
Suntasia
• Neutral receiver: “it was difficult to
understand … what was being offered and
what was expected of the consumer.”
• Suntasia marketing study of active
customers: 35% “did not recall their
membership...at all”
• Near record number of complaints
• FTC sues in summer 2007
FTC lawsuit changes decision
structure
• Court orders:
– Put firm under control of a neutral receiver
– Suspended billing and telemarketing
– Took seriously the notion that some
customers wanted to be enrolled
– Foresaw a resumption of billing
– Sent letters, exogenously assigned default in
each letter

Econometric model
• Discrete time hazard rate is a logit.
• Model all billing cycles before the lawsuit
plus all enrollment letters.
• We truncate cancellation letter recipients
at the time of the lawsuit
• Coefficients on demographics X = attrition
while firm operated; on Letter*X = predict
response to enrollment letters
Hazard rate model finds the same pattern. The story comes through in
several variables; quirks in measurement complicate interpretation
This leads to a 10-20% difference in predicted
attrition rates between residents of low SES and
high SES neighborhoods
Cancellation default outperforms enrollment default
with letters and charges by >$400

Address Payments Fraud; Comment Request (RIN 3064-ZA49)
Ms.(cid:3) Jennifer M. Jones(cid:3) (cid:3)
Deputy Executive(cid:3) Secretary(cid:3) (cid:3)
Attention: Comments—RIN 3064-ZA49(cid:3) (cid:3)
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation(cid:3) (cid:3)
550 17th Street NW
Washington, (cid:3)DC 20429
Dear Ms. Jones,(cid:3) Mr. McDonough, and Mr. Gould:(cid:3) (cid:3)
I am the(cid:3) EVP/Chief Operations Officer of (cid:3)Security Bank of Kansas City (Bank), a $3.6 billion community (cid:3)(cid:3)
bank located in Kansas(cid:3) City. I am writing to respond to the(cid:3) Office of the Comptroller (cid:3)of the(cid:3) Currency(cid:3) (cid:3)
(OCC)’s, Board(cid:3) of Governors of the(cid:3) Federal Reserve System (Board)’s,(cid:3) and Federal Deposit Insurance(cid:3) (cid:3)
Corporation (FDIC)’s(cid:3) request for information (RFI) on payments fraud.(cid:3) (cid:3)
Founded in 1933,(cid:3) Security Bank(cid:3) of Kansas City(cid:3) has been serving the Greater Kansas City area for nearly a
century,(cid:3) and we currently have 34 branches in both Kansas and(cid:3) Missouri. As(cid:3) a locally and privately
owned, state-chartered community bank,(cid:3) the Bank was born from a single idea:(cid:3) a bank dedicated to(cid:3) its (cid:3)(cid:3)
local community.(cid:3) We(cid:3) take pride in lasting (cid:3)relationships(cid:3) — many households(cid:3) have banked here(cid:3) for (cid:3)(cid:3)
multiple generations,(cid:3) underscoring our enduring commitment and stability. Recognized for our strength
and performance,(cid:3) we have been ranked the(cid:3) Strongest Large(cid:3) Bank in Kansas City by the Kansas City (cid:3)(cid:3)
Business(cid:3) Journal (cid:3)in 2024 and(cid:3) 2025,(cid:3) reinforcing (cid:3)our financial soundness and(cid:3) reputation.(cid:3) Through
generations of service,(cid:3) robust small-business lending, and personalized consumer banking, we continue(cid:3) (cid:3)
to play a vital role in nurturing (cid:3)financial resilience and opportunity throughout the Kansas City region.(cid:3) (cid:3)
I applaud the agencies for (cid:3)issuing this RFI and seeking input on ways that the OCC, the(cid:3) Federal Reserve(cid:3) (cid:3)
System (FRS), and the(cid:3) FDIC could take actions to help consumers, businesses, and financial institutions(cid:3) (cid:3)
mitigate payments (cid:3)fraud. Community banks continue to be challenged by a (cid:3)rise in fraud and scams (cid:3)(cid:3)
across payment types, so agency action is much needed. (cid:3)(cid:3)
Specifically, we have been affected by payments fraud in the(cid:3) following ways:(cid:3) (cid:3)
 Check Fraud- We see(cid:3) fraud starting with checks intercepted from mailboxes and/or (cid:3)the(cid:3) (cid:3)
U.S. Postal Service (cid:3)by fraudsters. The checks are then either washed,(cid:3) altered, or counterfeited,(cid:3) (cid:3)
and then deposited into the fraudsters' accounts at other banks.(cid:3) Working directly with other (cid:3)(cid:3)
1
financial institutions,(cid:3) especially larger banks,(cid:3) is a very difficult and lengthy (cid:3)process, and often the(cid:3) (cid:3)
BOFD is(cid:3) uncooperative(cid:3) even though(cid:3) their customer is depositing fraudulent funds. They will delay
responding and returning credits hoping you (cid:3)do(cid:3) not (cid:3)have the(cid:3) means to take legal action.(cid:3) We(cid:3) are(cid:3) (cid:3)
concerned that some (cid:3)larger financial institutions are not exercising sufficient CIP/KYC processes (cid:3)(cid:3)
and opening accounts that (cid:3)are(cid:3) being leveraged(cid:3) by fraudsters.(cid:3) (cid:3)
 ACH and Wire Fraud -We see fraud starting with phone spoofing or email compromises to(cid:3) (cid:3)
gain access(cid:3) into online banking in order (cid:3)to(cid:3) facilitate ACH or wire payments. Once the fraudsters(cid:3) (cid:3)
gain access(cid:3) and create an outgoing payment,(cid:3) we(cid:3) then have to(cid:3) work directly with the banks(cid:3) (cid:3)
receiving those payments.(cid:3) Because each bank's primary focus is to protect their best interests(cid:3) (cid:3)
(and(cid:3) not stopping fraud),(cid:3) many times banks are less than willing (cid:3)to (cid:3)cooperate in returning
payments sent due(cid:3) to fraud.(cid:3) Again, insufficient CIP/KYC processes(cid:3) with larger financial
institutions are allowing fraudsters(cid:3) to structure fraudulent payments(cid:3) throughout the banking (cid:3)(cid:3)
system with no watch or accountability from the banks. (cid:3)(cid:3)
The Bank supports collaborative stakeholder efforts to address(cid:3) payments fraud. Criminal networks(cid:3) (cid:3)
operate globally,(cid:3) while(cid:3) defenses are fragmented and siloed. National stakeholder collaboration is(cid:3) (cid:3)
necessary to (cid:3)effectively combat the problem. However,(cid:3) national efforts(cid:3) must recognize(cid:3) the(cid:3) resource(cid:3) (cid:3)
constraints individual community banks face when deciding whether to(cid:3) participate.(cid:3) Local and regional
collaboration across community banks, federal and state(cid:3) regulators,(cid:3) law enforcement, community (cid:3)(cid:3)
organizations,(cid:3) and other stakeholders(cid:3) can be an effective way to(cid:3) build(cid:3) connections and share(cid:3) (cid:3)
information at the(cid:3) community level.(cid:3) There is(cid:3) no(cid:3) single, standard(cid:3) mechanism or source for collecting or (cid:3)(cid:3)
reporting fraud data. Barriers to collecting data, including operational, legal, and regulatory constraints,(cid:3) (cid:3)
make it difficult to provide actionable, centralized fraud data.(cid:3) If FinCEN or a like organization created a (cid:3)(cid:3)
central depository for fraud data (cid:3)that all banks(cid:3) could utilize, it would allow the banks(cid:3) to work(cid:3) collectively
against fraud opposed(cid:3) to(cid:3) every bank(cid:3) for itself. The fraudsters(cid:3) are working in unison, (cid:3)the(cid:3) banking system
is(cid:3) not.(cid:3) (cid:3)
Payments fraud is(cid:3) no longer a (cid:3)nuisance — (cid:3)it's(cid:3) a systemic crisis. Banks face(cid:3) rising losses, regulators are(cid:3) (cid:3)
pushing liability (cid:3)onto (cid:3)them, and(cid:3) fraudsters(cid:3) keep outpacing defenses. Without stronger industry
collaboration, smarter (cid:3)fraud detection, and more robust consumer protections,(cid:3) payments fraud will
continue(cid:3) to spiral.(cid:3) (cid:3)
Thank you (cid:3)for the(cid:3) opportunity to provide comments on this RFI.(cid:3) The Bank looks forward to continuing to(cid:3) (cid:3)
work with the OCC, FRS, and FDIC, and (cid:3)other (cid:3)stakeholders(cid:3) to(cid:3) protect our customers(cid:3) and communities(cid:3) (cid:3)
from the growing threat of payments(cid:3) fraud.(cid:3) (cid:3)
Sincerely, (cid:3)(cid:3)

Dear Ms. Jones, (cid:3)Mr.(cid:3) McDonough, (cid:3)and Mr. (cid:3)Gould: (cid:3)
1
I am the (cid:3)CEO of First(cid:3) Security Bank(cid:3) of Roundup, an $85 million community
bank (cid:3)located in Roundup, MT.(cid:3) I am(cid:3) writing to respond to the Office of the (cid:3)
Comptroller of the (cid:3)Currency (OCC)’s, (cid:3)Board of Governors(cid:3) of the Federal
Reserve System (Board)’s, (cid:3)and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
(FDIC)’s request for information (RFI) on payments (cid:3)fraud. (cid:3)
First Security Bank of Roundup was chartered in 1971 to serve (cid:3)the (cid:3)Community
of Roundup(cid:3) MT (cid:3)and has(cid:3) done that for the last 54 (cid:3)years. (cid:3)We have no branches,(cid:3)
and there(cid:3) are(cid:3) no(cid:3) other Banks(cid:3) in Musselshell County. It is(cid:3) 50 miles(cid:3) or more to(cid:3)
another bank no matter what direction you go. Due(cid:3) to this(cid:3) we are(cid:3) the (cid:3)only
option for (cid:3)our commercial customers(cid:3) as(cid:3) driving 100 miles(cid:3) to deposit the (cid:3)day’s(cid:3)
receipts is(cid:3) not an option. We also provide (cid:3)services(cid:3) for our (cid:3)County and(cid:3) the (cid:3)
neighboring (cid:3)County, (cid:3)the local Hospital,(cid:3) 3 school districts(cid:3) and 2 (cid:3)towns.(cid:3) We are(cid:3)
the (cid:3)definition of a Community Bank(cid:3)
I applaud the(cid:3) agencies(cid:3) for issuing (cid:3)this RFI and seeking input on (cid:3)ways(cid:3) that the (cid:3)
OCC, (cid:3)the Federal Reserve System (FRS), (cid:3)and the(cid:3) FDIC could take actions(cid:3) to(cid:3)
help consumers,(cid:3) businesses, (cid:3)and financial institutions (cid:3)mitigate (cid:3)payments(cid:3)
fraud. Community banks(cid:3) continue(cid:3) to be challenged(cid:3) by a rise in fraud and(cid:3)
scams across(cid:3) payment types,(cid:3) so agency action is(cid:3) much needed.(cid:3)
Specifically, (cid:3)our Bank (cid:3)has been affected(cid:3) by payments fraud in the (cid:3)following (cid:3)
ways:(cid:3)
 We (cid:3)have (cid:3)seen(cid:3) numerous(cid:3) fraudulent mobile deposits,(cid:3) marketplace(cid:3) sales,(cid:3)
and other deceptive practices(cid:3) asking the (cid:3)consumer to send(cid:3) back(cid:3) gift(cid:3)
cards (cid:3)and(cid:3) relying on (cid:3)the (cid:3)slow(cid:3) NSF return times(cid:3) of larger financial
institutions.(cid:3)
Our debit card program has seen an explosion of fraud. In all of 2015 we(cid:3)

had 4 fraudulent transactions (cid:3)and last year we had(cid:3) 97 fraudulent
transactions.(cid:3)
2
We (cid:3)have (cid:3)seen(cid:3) nearly all of the(cid:3) online schemes(cid:3) in one (cid:3)form or another and(cid:3)

our small town is(cid:3) only 1800 people.(cid:3)
External(cid:3) Collaboration
The Bank(cid:3) supports(cid:3) collaborative (cid:3)stakeholder efforts(cid:3) to address payments(cid:3)
fraud. Fraud and scams (cid:3)persist across(cid:3) state borders,(cid:3) so national stakeholder
collaboration is(cid:3) necessary to effectively combat the(cid:3) problem. However,(cid:3)
national efforts must recognize the(cid:3) resource constraints individual community(cid:3)
banks(cid:3) face(cid:3) when deciding whether to participate.(cid:3) National efforts also must(cid:3)
recognize(cid:3) the (cid:3)constraints on large regional banks(cid:3) due (cid:3)to the large(cid:3) volumes of
transactions (cid:3)they handle.(cid:3)
 Most regional banks(cid:3) in our area will no (cid:3)longer verify funds (cid:3)on a check(cid:3) over
the (cid:3)phone which greatly increases(cid:3) the (cid:3)risks in accepting paper checks.(cid:3) In
all of this(cid:3) timely cooperation is(cid:3) the(cid:3) key to combating (cid:3)most(cid:3) of the(cid:3)
fraudulent cases(cid:3) we (cid:3)see.(cid:3)
Local and(cid:3) regional collaboration across(cid:3) community banks,(cid:3) federal and(cid:3)

state regulators,(cid:3) law enforcement,(cid:3) community organizations,(cid:3) and(cid:3) other(cid:3)
stakeholders(cid:3) can be an effective way to build connections (cid:3)and share(cid:3)
information (cid:3)at the community level. I would suggest(cid:3) some (cid:3)kind of (cid:3)Central
Information and Reporting clearinghouse(cid:3) that we (cid:3)all can access(cid:3) to verify
transactions.(cid:3)
Consumer,(cid:3) Business, and(cid:3) Industry Education(cid:3)
Community banks thrive,(cid:3) in part, (cid:3)because(cid:3) of their close customer

relationships,(cid:3) so face-to-face engagement is(cid:3) one of the (cid:3)most effective(cid:3)
tools to reach community bank (cid:3)customers. (cid:3)In-branch material and(cid:3)
messaging (cid:3)is especially valuable for (cid:3)community banks. (cid:3)
Community banks serve elderly customers, (cid:3)as(cid:3) well as consumers and(cid:3)

small businesses in rural and agricultural areas, so educational materials (cid:3)
tailored to these(cid:3) groups(cid:3) would be (cid:3)valuable. Some community banks(cid:3) are(cid:3)
in areas(cid:3) that do not have widespread,(cid:3) reliable (cid:3)Internet access, (cid:3)so (cid:3)web-
based resources are (cid:3)not always (cid:3)accessible (cid:3)to customers. (cid:3)
Regulation and(cid:3) Supervision
3
Broadly speaking,(cid:3) payments fraud regulations(cid:3) and examiner expectations (cid:3)
need to be appropriately tailored to (cid:3)community banks(cid:3) with tiered(cid:3) compliance(cid:3)
requirements (cid:3)and deadlines.(cid:3) There(cid:3) are opportunities(cid:3) to enhance(cid:3) supervisory
guidance(cid:3) around(cid:3) appropriate controls,(cid:3) suitable (cid:3)technology, (cid:3)reporting,(cid:3) and(cid:3)
incident response, but it is(cid:3) important to avoid imposing (cid:3)new(cid:3) burdens(cid:3) on
community banks.(cid:3)
Check fraud, in particular,(cid:3) remains(cid:3) a significant issue. Community banks(cid:3)

are(cid:3) concerned that some (cid:3)large financial institutions (cid:3)are(cid:3) not exercising
sufficient(cid:3) CIP/KYC processes(cid:3) and(cid:3) opening (cid:3)accounts that are(cid:3) being (cid:3)
leveraged by fraudsters.(cid:3) Similarly, community banks(cid:3) have (cid:3)had(cid:3) significant
difficulty resolving interbank disputes(cid:3) regarding (cid:3)fraudulent checks.(cid:3) This(cid:3)
bank (cid:3)has had two(cid:3) occurrences(cid:3) where it took(cid:3) over 4 (cid:3)months to resolve (cid:3)a(cid:3)
fraudulent check(cid:3) claim with a large bank (cid:3)that just kept asking for (cid:3)more(cid:3)
information (cid:3)and handing (cid:3)it off to another department.(cid:3) We had to(cid:3) file(cid:3) a
complaint with their regulator (cid:3)to finally get them to address our claim. It(cid:3)
was not much money for them, (cid:3)but the (cid:3)$4,500 meant(cid:3) a lot to(cid:3) us(cid:3) and our
customer(cid:3)
Changes to Regulation CC could help community banks(cid:3) prevent and(cid:3)

mitigate (cid:3)check fraud.(cid:3) For example, the (cid:3)return deadline (cid:3)related(cid:3) to fraud(cid:3)
could(cid:3) be extended, the “reasonable(cid:3) cause to doubt collectability”(cid:3)
exception could(cid:3) be clarified, and(cid:3) relevant definitions (cid:3)could be(cid:3) revised(cid:3)
(e.g.,(cid:3) “altered” and “alteration”). However,(cid:3) hold times(cid:3) should not be (cid:3)
shortened;(cid:3) they are(cid:3) an essential tool for banks to detect and(cid:3) prevent
check(cid:3) fraud. Financial institutions (cid:3)should have (cid:3)flexibility to extend hold(cid:3)
times under appropriate circumstances.(cid:3)
Payments(cid:3) Fraud(cid:3) Data Collection and(cid:3) Information Sharing(cid:3)
While centralized data reporting would(cid:3) be valuable for (cid:3)the (cid:3)ecosystem,(cid:3)

agencies(cid:3) should(cid:3) avoid imposing (cid:3)additional data collection requirements(cid:3)
on community banks.(cid:3) Appropriate safe (cid:3)harbors(cid:3) would improve banks’(cid:3)
ability and willingness (cid:3)to share fraud data. (cid:3)
Community banks would benefit from automated(cid:3) data collection, (cid:3)

analysis,(cid:3) and reporting (cid:3)tools(cid:3) that are(cid:3) integrated(cid:3) with services(cid:3) they
already use(cid:3) and(cid:3) do not come with additional costs.(cid:3) Maybe the(cid:3) SAR(cid:3)
reporting could(cid:3) be leveraged(cid:3) as(cid:3) a way to (cid:3)collect the(cid:3) data. (cid:3)
4
Reserve Banks’(cid:3) Operator Tools(cid:3) and Services(cid:3)
Community banks would benefit from tools(cid:3) and(cid:3) services(cid:3) that integrate (cid:3)

with third-party services(cid:3) they already use and pricing that is appropriate(cid:3)
for their size and(cid:3) complexity.(cid:3)
There(cid:3) are(cid:3) a variety of specific(cid:3) products and services(cid:3) that could(cid:3) benefit

community banks,(cid:3) including,(cid:3) for example, (cid:3)a fraud contact directory, (cid:3)a(cid:3)
fraud information sharing repository, an interbank check(cid:3) fraud breach of
warranty claim mechanism,(cid:3) a check image(cid:3) analysis and (cid:3)verification (cid:3)tool, (cid:3)
an atypical payment monitoring service,(cid:3) and confirmation of payee(cid:3)
service.(cid:3)
General (cid:3)Questions (cid:3)
The dollars(cid:3) lost annually in this country to fraud is(cid:3) staggering.(cid:3) There has(cid:3) to be(cid:3)
some (cid:3)way to counter this that is(cid:3) profitable (cid:3)from the financial community side.(cid:3)
This(cid:3) bank (cid:3)would(cid:3) be (cid:3)happy to contribute (cid:3)to a system that saves(cid:3) more(cid:3) dollars(cid:3)
than the (cid:3)cost of the (cid:3)system, whatever it may be.(cid:3)
It seems (cid:3)that there are(cid:3) systems(cid:3) and procedures in place but there is(cid:3) never any
follow through as(cid:3) far (cid:3)as(cid:3) arrest and prosecution unless the (cid:3)criminal is(cid:3) dealing (cid:3)
with substantial dollars.(cid:3) A transaction of (cid:3)thousands is(cid:3) significant to this(cid:3) bank (cid:3)
and our customers, (cid:3)but it seems (cid:3)it takes(cid:3) hundreds of thousands(cid:3) to(cid:3) get any
agency(cid:3) interested in pursuing (cid:3)a fraudster. (cid:3)Until something changes(cid:3) that
mindset we(cid:3) can put all the systems(cid:3) in the (cid:3)world in place to track(cid:3) fraud, (cid:3)but it
will not slow down as the (cid:3)fraudsters(cid:3) understand the (cid:3)thresholds better than I
do(cid:3)
Thank (cid:3)you for (cid:3)the (cid:3)opportunity to provide(cid:3) comments(cid:3) on this(cid:3) RFI.(cid:3) The Bank (cid:3)looks(cid:3)
forward to continuing to work(cid:3) with the(cid:3) OCC, FRS,(cid:3) and(cid:3) FDIC, (cid:3)and other(cid:3)
stakeholders(cid:3) to protect our customers(cid:3) and(cid:3) communities(cid:3) from the growing (cid:3)
threat of (cid:3)payments fraud. (cid:3)

FTC Rule – Preservation of Claims and Defenses NOTICE
Any holder of this consumer credit contract is subject to

contracts used in financing the retail purchase of consumer
goods or services specifically preserve the consumer’s rights
against the seller. The FTC determined that it constitutes an
unfair and deceptive practice for a seller, in the course of

procedures which make the consumer’s duty to pay

Regulation Overview
The Holder-in-Due-Course Rule prohibits a seller from taking
or receiving a consumer credit contract that does not contain a
prescribed notice which preserves the consumer’s claims and
defenses in the event that the contract is negotiated or assigned
to a third party creditor. In addition, the Rule provides that the
seller may not accept the proceeds of a purchase money loan
unless the evidence of the loan contains the prescribed notice
preserving as against the lender whatever claims and defenses
the consumer may have against the seller. Omission of the
required notice by the seller, or acceptance by the seller of the
proceeds of the purchase money loan where the evidence of
the loan does not contain the notice, constitutes an unfair or
deceptive practice within the meaning of Section 5 of the
Federal Trade Commission Act.
The Rule does not apply to all credit instruments. The Notice
must appear in written obligations defined as “Consumer
Credit Contracts” in the Rule. The definition includes any
written instrument which, under the Truth in Lending Act and
Regulation Z constitutes a consumer credit contract and which
is used to “Finance a Sale” or in connection with a “Purchase
Money Loan,” as those terms are defined in the Rule. Credit
card instruments are specifically exempted from the Rule.
Under the Rule, banks which purchase consumer paper
containing the notice required of sellers cannot avail
themselves of the holder-in-due-course doctrine. Also, banks
which make purchase money loans containing the notice will
be subject to all claims and defenses which the consumer
could assert against the seller.

If banks accept consumer paper which fails to contain the
notice required of sellers, they may be considered to be a FTC Trade Regulation Rule Concerning the Preservation of
participant in the seller’s violation of the Rule. Banks making Consumers’ Claims and Defenses, and Staff Guidelines
purchase money loans must include the prescribed notice in

their contracts.

Concerning (cid:3)check(cid:3) fraud(cid:3) –(cid:3) this (cid:3)area(cid:3) of(cid:3) fraud(cid:3) has(cid:3) increased(cid:3) tremendously(cid:3) over(cid:3) the (cid:3)past(cid:3) five (cid:3)years.(cid:3) At(cid:3)
first, (cid:3)it(cid:3) targeted(cid:3) business (cid:3)customers(cid:3) and (cid:3)now (cid:3)it (cid:3)is (cid:3)trending (cid:3)towards(cid:3) consumer(cid:3) customers.(cid:3)

Address Payments Fraud; Comment Request (RIN 3064-ZA49)
Ms.(cid:3) Jennifer M. Jones(cid:3)
Deputy Executive(cid:3) Secretary
Attention: Comments—RIN 3064-ZA49
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
550 17th Street NW
Washington, (cid:3)DC 20429
Dear Ms. Jones: (cid:3)
I am the(cid:3) president of Cleveland State Bank of Cleveland, Mississippi.(cid:3) We are a $330,000,000 asset bank(cid:3)
serving both Bolivar (cid:3)and Grenada counties(cid:3) in west central Mississippi.(cid:3) I am writing to (cid:3)share(cid:3) our story and(cid:3)
as a response(cid:3) to (cid:3)the(cid:3) OCC’s, FRS’s and FDIC’s(cid:3) request for (cid:3)information on payments fraud.(cid:3)
Again,(cid:3) our (cid:3)bank (cid:3)is a local community (cid:3)bank that is(cid:3) headquartered in Cleveland (the(cid:3) only one) and also(cid:3)
serves the(cid:3) greater Grenada community. Having been founded in(cid:3) 1908, we take great pride in our
continuous(cid:3) commitment to the 2 local communities we serve. We (cid:3)feel that we are a very key cog to (cid:3)the(cid:3)
local economic(cid:3) engine whereby our (cid:3)local area has a higher than average(cid:3) poverty percentage(cid:3) as well as a
larger percentage of low to(cid:3) moderate income(cid:3) citizens. A high percentage of our loans (cid:3)are to small
businesses and(cid:3) consumers. We (cid:3)also, very largely and purposely, support many local non-profit
organizations with an emphasis on schools, students and child-age(cid:3) organizations.(cid:3) I very often use the(cid:3)
phrase “for the (cid:3)kids” and that is the truth. At heart, they are our future. (cid:3)
I thank you for the opportunity to (cid:3)share our (cid:3)“fraud” story and for (cid:3)your agency seeking input regarding (cid:3)
such. It is my hope and desire that this(cid:3) letter serves(cid:3) to assist you and(cid:3) your agency in developing policy
and actions that will not just benefit the (cid:3)community banks(cid:3) but also bring assurance and confidence to(cid:3)
consumers (cid:3)and small businesses who (cid:3)have been victims of check fraud and payments fraud.(cid:3)
Our bank and our customers(cid:3) have both been victims of check fraud and debit card fraud. In August,(cid:3)
2023,(cid:3) I was emotionally informed (cid:3)by one(cid:3) of (cid:3)our small business (cid:3)customers that 3 checks that they had (cid:3)
mailed on the same day via the United States Post Office(cid:3) in July, (cid:3)2023(cid:3) had not been received by (cid:3)the(cid:3)
intended receiver; (cid:3)that they were (cid:3)now “marked” (cid:3)as past due with those vendors. Their quick review of (cid:3)
their online account with us (cid:3)verified that the checks had “cleared” their account. Their visit to our bank(cid:3)
1
revealed that these(cid:3) checks had each been altered with a new(cid:3) payee; deposited and processed through
JP Morgan Chase Bank(cid:3) and “paid” against their CSB account balance.(cid:3) Upon (cid:3)our review,(cid:3) we determined(cid:3)
that (cid:3)this was, indeed,(cid:3) a clear depiction of what(cid:3) had(cid:3) occurred and after (cid:3)they executed the(cid:3) appropriate(cid:3)
affidavits (cid:3)of (cid:3)altered checks, we restored/reimbursed our (cid:3)customer for (cid:3)the total amount, over (cid:3)
$780,000.(cid:3) This was a staggering amount for a bank our size! (cid:3) We immediately contacted local law (cid:3)
enforcement, legal counsel and our insurance(cid:3) company. Within the (cid:3)next 6 weeks, several other (cid:3)
check/mail fraud instances also occurred.(cid:3) Our (cid:3)operations/payments(cid:3) employee immediately researched(cid:3)
the correct process via the Federal Reserve Bank and our correspondent bank,(cid:3) First National Bankers’(cid:3)
Bank,(cid:3) Baton Rouge, Louisiana.(cid:3) Upon following FRB procedures,(cid:3) we submitted fraud claims to the(cid:3)
various banks of first deposit on the(cid:3) altered checks. Quickly,(cid:3) our claims were denied on the(cid:3) larger
denomination checks, yet we were reimbursed on the smaller size(cid:3) checks. We(cid:3) then sought professional
guidance via our correspondent, FNBB,(cid:3) and were(cid:3) connected with a law firm in Houston, Texas who(cid:3)
already had experience in check fraud liability (cid:3)and(cid:3) recovery. They filed(cid:3) suit on (cid:3)our behalf after (cid:3)multiple(cid:3)
denials(cid:3) of responsibility by the(cid:3) banks of (cid:3)first(cid:3) deposit.(cid:3) Internally, we quickly developed manual processes(cid:3)
to review daily incoming checks/payments as to prevent additional loss.(cid:3) Noteworthy, we,(cid:3) quickly, (cid:3)
almost immediately,(cid:3) restored credit to our customers’ accounts after (cid:3)the altered check status(cid:3) was(cid:3)
determined.(cid:3) Regardless(cid:3) of regulations/legality, we felt a responsibility to make whole our customers(cid:3) and(cid:3)
support the(cid:3) livelihood of their small businesses had we(cid:3) not, some of them could have been gravely
harmed. We (cid:3)eventually, almost 1 (cid:3)year later,(cid:3) became forced to file an insurance(cid:3) claim as there was(cid:3)
minimal progress occurring with litigation and the expiration date to file a claim was closing in. We (cid:3)feel
fortunate to have had (cid:3)insurance coverage(cid:3) for such activity, albeit, a $75,000 deductible. In the (cid:3)end, our (cid:3)
bank had (cid:3)a loss(cid:3) of the aforementioned deductible and several thousand dollars of legal expense.(cid:3) We(cid:3)
have now purchased “positive pay” software as a method to risk mitigate this continued risk.(cid:3)
My ask and desire is this: For the combined regulatory authorities, FFIEC, to have and execute (cid:3)
enforcement authority over the already written regulations (cid:3)regarding (cid:3)this (cid:3)type of fraud. Research reveals (cid:3)
that (cid:3)the (cid:3)regulatory agencies describe the differences in “counterfeit checks” and “altered(cid:3)
checks”. Maybe (due (cid:3)to technology) more specific definitions are needed as well as enforcement
procedures (cid:3)with the (cid:3)FRS holding complete authority (cid:3)to reverse (cid:3)payments with proof of alteration. The (cid:3)
large money center banks (cid:3)need a burden of responsibility of “knowing (cid:3)your customer” upon opening (cid:3)
these (cid:3)“fake” accounts remotely with false identities. (cid:3) We learned of these details(cid:3) and that our items were(cid:3)
all deposited via remote mobile deposit into (cid:3)newly opened accounts that were opened(cid:3) remotely via the (cid:3)
bank’s website,(cid:3) avoiding human interaction and detection. (cid:3)
The above narrative was(cid:3) focused on check fraud; however,(cid:3) we have had multiple customers(cid:3) who(cid:3) have(cid:3)
also experienced debit card fraud,(cid:3) telephone fraud and(cid:3) mail solicitation fraud.(cid:3) Many of these victims are(cid:3)
elderly and/or can not afford(cid:3) the loss of funds and the(cid:3) associated economic(cid:3) security. (cid:3)
Again,(cid:3) I thank(cid:3) you for this(cid:3) opportunity to “share our story”(cid:3) and for your (cid:3)agency’s interest in modernizing (cid:3)
the regulations and processes to combat modern-day payments fraud.(cid:3)
I welcome your calls or replies(cid:3) and (cid:3)if any additional information is(cid:3) needed from our bank. My telephone(cid:3)
number is(cid:3) . (cid:3)

The Citizens Bank, Philadelphia, MS recommends the CTR reportable threshold of $10,000.00 be re­
evaluated and raised to a higher threshold thereby enabling the reported transactions to be better
utilized in law enforcement reviews. Additionally, the SAR threshold of $5,000.00 should be re­
evaluated and raised to a higher threshold enabling better quality cases to be reviewed by law
enforcement. The current thresholds of CTRs and SARs is outdated in comparison to the financial
industry and currently causes an excessive number of filed reports and cumbersome work for
financial institutions and those who review those filed reports.

I. Introduction
The Electronic Transactions Association (“ETA”) appreciates this opportunity to comment on the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation’s (“FDIC”) proposed Examination Guidance on Third-Party Lending (the
“Guidance”).1 ETA is the leading trade association for the payments industry, representing nearly 550
companiesworldwideinvolvedinelectronictransactionprocessingproductsandservices.Inadditiontoits
work with companies in the payments space, ETA represents members in the small business finance
industry. Many of these members offer financing opportunities to small businesses through partnerships
with depository institutions, including those regulated by the FDIC. Because nonbank entities frequently
employ online platforms and systems that are more efficient and cost-effective for processing and
underwriting smaller commercial loans, these companies are able to provide a valuable service to banks
andexpandthescopeofeligiblesmallbusinessborrowers.
While ETA supports the FDIC’s goal of promoting safe and sound banking practices, we suggest that the
FDIC further tailor the Guidance to reflect important differences between consumer and small business
lending, and also to avoid language that suggests third-party lending relationships should be viewed with
heightenedscrutinyorsuspicion.TheGuidanceshouldfosterinnovationinamarketthatisbenefitingsmall
businesses seeking capital to grow. Adopting a one-size-fits-all Guidance that treats all third-party
relationships the same may have the unintended consequence of encouraging “de-risking” by banks with
existing or potential third-party lending relationships. Such an outcome would harm small businesses by
restrictingtheiraccesstomuchneededcredit.
II. SmallBusinessLoanMarket
AstheFDIC islikelyaware,smallbusinessesareanincrediblyimportantpartoftheU.S.economy.Small
businesses employ half of the nation’s private sector workers and in recent decades have created two-
thirds of net new jobs.2 Many of these small businesses struggle to grow,3 with access to growth capital
and cash flow management cited as key challenges.4 Many companies look to debt financing to resolve
theseissuesand47%ofrespondentsina2015FederalReservestudyonsmallbusinesscreditstatedthey
had applied for credit in the past 12 months.5 Of those small businesses that applied, 18% were not
approvedfor anyfinancing, whileanother 50% statedtheywerenotapproved for thefull amountof credit
they sought.6 In addition, 16% of all respondents stated they did not apply for financing because they
believed they would be turned down. Although traditional bank lending remains the primary source of
financingforsmallbusinesses,banksalonearenotmeetingthedemand.

Third-party lending relationships between banks and non-bank companies represent an important
alternativetotraditionalbank lendingthat is helpingto fillthegapinsmallbusiness demandforfinancing.

that the bank relies on the non-bank entity to perform certain aspects of the lending process, including
marketing, borrower solicitation, loan origination and processing, and underwriting, among others.7 As
noted by the Treasury Department in its white paper on online lending, small business lending has
historically involved high search, transaction, and underwriting costs for banks relative to earnings
potential.8TheTreasuryfoundthatpartnershiparrangementsbetweenbanksandnon-banksallowfinancial

III. TheFDIC’sGuidanceNeedstoAccountfortheImportantDifferencesinTypesofThird-
PartyLending Arrangements
A. SmallBusinessversusConsumerLending
Asdrafted,theGuidanceappearstotakeaone-size-fits-allapproachtothirdpartylendingarrangements.
The focus of the Guidance, for example, is to set forth “safetyand soundness and consumer compliance
measures FDIC-supervised institutions should follow when lending through a business relationship with a
thirdparty.”11TheGuidancealsostatesthat“Institutionsthatengageinneworsignificantlendingactivities
throughthirdpartieswillgenerallyreceiveincreasedsupervisoryattention.”12
AlthoughtheGuidanceadvisesinstitutionstodeveloprisk-basedcomplianceprograms,theGuidancedoes

In this regard, regulation cannot and should not treat consumer and small business lending the same –
suchanapproachwouldhaveadetrimentaleffectforbothsmallbusinesslendersandthesmallbusiness
community. The Guidance should tailor examination and regulatoryrequirements and priorities according
to applicable laws based on whether the third-party lending arrangement involves consumer or business
lending.
WhileETAsupportstransparencyinsmallbusinesscredit,aregulatoryapproachthatfailstorecognizethe
important and significant distinctions between consumer and small business lending would inhibit small
business access to capital for the use cases noted above. We therefore encourage the FDIC to develop
Guidance and examination principles that are sensitive to the prospect that enhanced regulation and
scrutiny may limit lenders’ ability to answer the needs of small businesses by stifling creativity and
innovation.
B. RoleofPaymentNetworks
The Guidance defines “third-party lending” to be “a lending arrangement that relies on a third party to
performasignificantaspectofthelendingprocess,suchassomeorallofthefollowing:marketing;borrower
solicitation; credit underwriting; loan pricing; loan origination; retail installment sales contract issuance;
customer service; customer disclosures; regulatory compliance; loan servicing; debt collection; and data
collection,aggregation,orreporting.”13
As currently drafted, the definition could be interpreted to cover credit card payment networks. ETA
suggests that the definition include an exclusion for payment networks. These networks are technology

IV. SmallBusinessLendingis AlreadySubjectto SignificantFederaland State Regulatory

V. The FDIC Should Consider the Threat of “De-Risking” Before Increasing Regulatory
PressureonThird-PartyLendingArrangements
Although ETA appreciates the FDIC’s consideration of the risks that banks may face in partnering with
nonbank entities to originate loans, the FDIC should avoid sending the message that third-party lending
arrangements are inherently risky or require the same degree of scrutiny during examinations. To the
contrary, the “tone” established by bank regulators should incentivize and foster these partnerships that
yieldsignificantfinancialbenefitsandopportunitiesforsmallbusinesses.
In the past, federal regulators have released guidance indicating that certain bank customers or
relationships are “high-risk” and would receive increased scrutiny. The result of such guidance was to
discouragebanksfromformingrelationshipswithmerchantsorotherbusinessesdeemedhigh-risk,leading
tothe“de-risking”ofentireindustries.14Forexample,theFDICpreviouslypublishedguidancethatdeemed
third-party payment processors (“TPPP”) to be high risk, particularly those servicing certain merchant
classes.15 This guidance, issued against the backdrop of the Department of Justice’s Operation Choke
Point,16 caused widespread de-risking of TPPPs and other industries marked as “high-risk” by the
government.Eventually,theissuebecameseriousenoughthattheFDICreleasednewguidancequalifying
its prior guidance and encouraging banks to assess risk on an individual customer basis rather than
decliningtoprovideservicestoentirecategoriesofcustomers.17
In the Guidance, the FDIC states that it will apply “increased supervisory attention” to any institution
engaginginneworsignificantlendingactivitiesthroughthirdparties.”18Inaddition,institutionssignificantly
engaged in third-party lending arrangements will be expected to maintain “well-above average” capital
levels and are subject to a reduced twelve-month examination schedule instead of the eighteen-month
scheduleforwhichthebankmayqualify.19TheGuidance,however,doesnotprovidearationaletosupport
these enhanced requirements, or explain how additional scrutiny will reduce risk in the bank partnership
model. In most partnerships with small business lenders, banks originate the loans and then sell them
wholesaleto the lender partner, therebysignificantlydecreasing the needfor above-average capital.This
14 De-risking refers to the bank industry practice of refusing to enter into deposit account or other relationships with
customers in industries determined by regulators to be “high-risk.” De-risking can undermine financial inclusion,
financialtransparency,andfinancialactivity.RemarksofUnderSecretaryoftheTreasuryDavidCohenattheBA/ABA

Moreover, the Guidance fails to recognize the differences between various types of lending (consumer
versus commercial), as well as the many different business models in the market. The implication of the
Guidanceisthatbanksengagedinthird-partylendingarrangements–whetherconsumerorcommercial–
are participating in high-risk activities deserving of increased scrutiny. ETA is concerned that such
statements will cause banks currentlyengaged in third-partylending arrangements toshed someor all of
their partnerships, or increase their fees to cover the risk of this increased scrutiny, which, in turn, will
increase the cost of credit for small businesses.20Worse, bysuggesting it will apply increased scrutinyto
new lending activities through third parties, the FDIC is discouraging banks that have not already formed
sucharrangementsfrompartneringwithnonbanksinthefuture.Thiswillhavetheperverseeffectoflimiting

VI. Conclusion
Third-partylending arrangements between banks and nonbanks havecreated increased opportunities for
small businesses to obtain much-needed credit. Such partnerships increase efficiencies and reduce the
costtomakesmallbusinessloansforbanks,includinginstitutionssupervisedbytheFDIC.Asdrafted,we
are concerned that the FDIC’s Guidance will prompt its supervised institutions to reduce their third-party
lending partnerships, steer activity outside of bank regulatory frameworks, and discourage banks from
exploring how such arrangements can improve their loan origination processes – essentially driving the
oppositeoutcomesthatsoundpublicpolicywoulddictate.
WhileETAanditsmembersrespecttheFDIC’sneedtoexaminethird-partylendingpartnershipsforriskto
supervised institutions, we recommend the Guidance clarify that third party lending arrangements
(particularlycommercialones)arenotinherentlysuspiciousorhigh-risk.Further,werecommendremoving
referenceto“increasedsupervisoryattention,”particularlyasitpertainstonewlendingthroughthirdparties.
Otherwise,theGuidancesuggeststhatbanksnotalreadyengagedinthird-partylendingarrangementswill
be scrutinized merely for testing the benefits that such arrangements can offer. Finally, the FDIC should
emphasize that the risk of entering into any third-party lending arrangement should be assessed on an
individual basis and not as an entire class of bank customers or relationships, consistent with the FDIC’s
priorstatementsclarifyingitsguidanceonTPPPs.Webelievesuchstatementswouldavoida widespread
de-risking response to the Guidance and provide comfort to banks that currently engage in third-party
lendingarrangements.
