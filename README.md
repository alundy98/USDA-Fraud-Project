FDIC_scraper.py is a Python tool that collects FDIC articles matching specified financial fraud-related keywords while excluding inactive or outdated content. It uses Selenium to load JavaScript-generated search pages and BeautifulSoup to parse HTML, extracting article links, titles, and publication dates. The scraper handles both HTML and PDF articles(except scanned image files), capturing the full text of each, and filters for articles published within the last ten years. Output includes a structured dataset with the article title, URL, publication date, full content, and a timestamp, saved in both CSV and JSON formats for easy analysis.
