Consumers increasingly rely on computers, web-enabled devices, and the internet for everything from shopping and communicating to banking and bill-paying. While there are a number of benefits of using web services -- faster and more convenient services, for example -- bank customers should also be aware of the risks.

Common cyber-related crimes include identity theft, frauds, and scams. Identity theft is a crime in which someone wrongfully obtains and uses another person's personal data to open fraudulent credit card accounts, charge existing credit card accounts, withdraw funds from deposit accounts, or obtain new loans. A victim's losses may include not only out-of-pocket financial losses but also substantial costs to restore credit history and to correct erroneous information in their credit reports.
In addition to identity theft, every year millions of people are victims of frauds and scams , which often start with an email, text message, or phone message that appears to be from a legitimate, trusted organization. These messages typically ask consumers to verify or update personal information or they direct consumers to bogus websites (such as for credit repair services) in the hopes that consumers will visit the site and enter their personal information.
Additional information about various forms of cyber crime is provided in the following FDIC Consumer News articles:

The best protection against identity theft is to carefully guard your personal information.  For example:

Consumers should always exercise caution when it comes to your personal and financial information. The following tips may help prevent you from becoming a fraud victim.
Back to top

If you think you are a victim of a fraud or scam, contact your state, local, and/or federal consumer protection agency. State consumer protection agencies could be found using the usa.gov/state-consumer webpage. Federal consumer protection agencies include the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Federal Trade Commission. You could also contact the FDIC or other Federal banking agency if there is a banking issue involved. Also, a local law enforcement officer may be able to provide advice and assistance. By promptly reporting fraud, you improve your chances of recovering what you have lost and you help law enforcement. The agency you contact first may take action directly or refer you to another agency better positioned to protect you.
Violations of federal laws should be reported to the federal agency responsible for enforcement. Consumer complaints are used to document patterns of abuse, allowing the agency to take action against a company.
People who have no intention of delivering what is sold, who misrepresent items, send counterfeit goods, or otherwise try to trick you out of your money are committing fraud. If you suspect fraud, there are some additional steps to take.

Re: Response to Request for Information on Payments Fraud (RFI)
Docket IDs: OCC-2025-0009, FRS OP-1866, and FDIC RIN3064-ZA49
LexisNexis Risk Solutions Inc. (""LNRS"") appreciates the opportunity to comment on the Request for
Information (""RFI"") on Payments Fraud. LNRS submits this comment letter in support of the OCC,
FRS, and FDIC proactive stance on anti-fraud activities and to share insight on the use of consumer data
to support consumer identity verification, fraud detection and investigation that protect consumers and
the financial system as a whole.
LNRS provides information solutions to help predict and manage risk; and to protect consumers
and institutions from cyber risks, such as identity theft. LNRS solutions help our customers
underwrite and manage risks, detect and prevent fraud, positively identify individuals, and verify
that individuals are who they say they are. Consumers benefit from the use of data solutions as
those tools make it harder for fraudsters to steal identities to get credit, services or benefits they
are not entitled to obtain.
LNRS's corporate customers comprise over 75% of Fortune 500 companies, including major
retail businesses and all of the top 50 U.S. banks. LNRS also serves tens of thousands of small
and medium-size businesses, insurance companies, online retailers, manufacturers, healthcare
providers, non-profits, and federal, state, and local government law enforcement and other
agencies. The LexisNexis® Digital Identity Network analyzes more than 345 million
transactions daily, and over 121 billion transactions annually. Additionally our network-driven
solutions detected around 690m human initiated fraud attacks and more than 2bn automated bot
attacks for customers in 2024
As an example of payment-specific fraud tools operating in other jurisdictions, LexisNexis Risk
Solutions operates ThreatMetrix® Payment Defense in the UK which provides risk assessment of
both outbound and inbound payments. This solution utilizes cross party event data and machine
learning to address Authorized Push Payment scams.
Our comments fall into four areas:
I. The Evolving Threat Landscape in New Payment Systems
• While traditional payments fraud persists, new and alternative payment systems have introduced
novel vulnerabilities.
o Crypto, non-bank payments, faster payments, p2p apps, etc. have added additional
variables and increased fraud attack surface for businesses and consumers alike. The
speed and irreversibility of payments create a unique risk, compounded by an increased
attack surface.
o Traditional sources of payment processing, including checks are able to access
authoritative verification of sending and receiving entity data and account association.
The ability of newer payment methodologies to leverage similar data is constrained.
• The decentralized and often cross-platform nature of these systems makes it difficult for a
single entity to detect and prevent sophisticated fraud rings. Pseudonymity and anonymity
are frequently core tenets of many emerging payment systems. Fraudsters often use chain
hopping techniques to obscure the trail of stolen funds, and the lack of established regulatory
authority and jurisdictional challenges create further complexity.
o According to FTC's Sentinel Report, imposter and investment scams accounted for
$8.8b in fraud losses in 2024.
o The 2025 LexisNexis Risk Solutions True Cost of Fraud study indicates that
Financial Institutions report an average additional cost of $5.75 for every $1 lost to
fraud. Additionally, the impact to customer experience of fraud prevention
techniques results in additional losses due to friction.
• Existing data-sharing safe harbors, which allow controlled exchange of information on the
parties to a transaction for the purposes of fraud prevention, were largely designed for
traditional banking relationships and do not adequately address the unique needs of these
new systems and new participants in the transaction stream.
II. The Critical Role of Enhanced Data Sharing to Prevent and Detect Fraud.
• Real-time, cross-platform data sharing is essential for moving from a reactive to a proactive
fraud prevention model that leverages network intelligence.
o Based on LNRS research, the following types of data would be most useful for inclusion
in a network fraud solution:
■ transaction patterns
■ sending and beneficiary account details including social alias for P2P powered
payment apps
■ behavioral indicators
■ known fraudulent indicators.
■ for crypto, consider the impact of on-chain and off-chain data while respecting the
inherent non-identifying nature of crypto wallets
• Safe harbors would enable non-traditional payment system operators to securely share
aggregated fraud signals with its partner banks and other e-commerce platforms, creating a
network effect that benefits all participants and customers.
III. The Need for Regulatory Clarity and Safe Harbors
• Companies are hesitant to share data for the following reasons:
o Legal and compliance uncertainty related to fear of violating privacy provisions of
the GLBA, FCRA, or EFTA.
o Antitrust concerns regarding information sharing between competitors.
o Unclear liability for data breaches or misuse of shared information.
• Without explicit regulatory safe harbors, industry participants will remain cautious, allowing
fraudulent activity to flourish in the seams between systems.
IV. Specific Recommendations for the OCC, FRS and FDIC
• Issue Guidance: The OCC, FRS and FDIC should solicit best practices and publish guidance
that defines the specific conditions under which data sharing for payments fraud prevention
is permissible, and which types of data are considered safe to share. Additionally, continue to
leverage and improve the Federal Reserve fraud/scam classifier models to ensure uniformity
and ease of implementation
• Establish a formal Safe Harbor provision: Create a new, payments-specific safe harbor
provision that explicitly protects firms collaborating on fraud prevention
• Examine current private sector best practices and convene a public-private sector working
group: OCC, FRS and FDIC should lead an industry-wide task force to examine current
consortia and discuss best practices for data exchange, ensuring all stakeholders (banks,
fintechs, payment providers, risk mitigation providers) have a voice.

We look forward to partnering with you to create an updated framework that protects consumers and

To Whom It May Concern:
On behalf of SentiLink, I am pleased to submit the following comments in response to
the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (collectively, the
Agencies) Request for Information on Potential Actions to Address Payments Fraud
(RFI).1
About SentiLink
SentiLink provides identity verification, fraud mitigation and risk management solutions
to US-based financial institutions and others. SentiLink’s services ensure that applicants
are who they claim to be before credit evaluation begins, enabling financial institutions
and individuals to transact confidently by preventing identity fraud at the point that a
consumer is applying for any type of financial account. SentiLink was also the first
company in history to use the Social Security Administration’s Electronic Consent
Based SSN Verification service (eCBSV) to validate account application data.
Each day SentiLink helps over 3,000,000 consumers applying for financial products and
services, and in doing so prevents approximately 60,000 cases of identity fraud daily.
Underneath the surface of our solutions are statistical models continually trained and
1 90 FR 26293 (June 20, 2025).
1
improved by three primary sources: First, data from external and highly vetted sources;
second, our team of expert risk analysts who review and manually investigate cases to
stay abreast of the leading edge of fraud tactics and criminal activity, feeding that
knowledge into model updates; and third, data provided by our clients (referred to as
""partners”). Our models deliver real-time fraud scores and signals via Application
Programming Interface (""API"") to our partners to help ensure:
● Good customers, including thin file and those new to credit, get onboarded
quickly;
● Consumers are protected from identity crime;
● Fraud in the financial system is reduced; and
● Financial regulatory obligations are satisfied.
SentiLink relies on credit header data and other data sources to build models and
enhance the precision of our solutions, which ultimately facilitate consumer access to
financial services by reducing fraud in the financial system. The high precision of our
scoring models allows our partner financial institutions to expedite approximately 97% of
“clear,” non-fraudulent applications through initial identity verification and fraud
prevention checks, enabling them to focus on reviewing only those applications that
present a high identity fraud risk. We do not collect or rely on demographic data and
have a robust process in place for independently auditing our scoring models, including
statistical assessments of impacts across demographic groups by a third-party
economic analysis firm.
It is from this perspective that we provide feedback to select questions in the RFI.
General Comments
We appreciate the Agencies offering an opportunity for stakeholder feedback on
whether additional actions by the Agencies may be warranted to combat payments
fraud. We agree that especially due to the complexity and scope of payments fraud,
input and engagement from a variety of stakeholders will be helpful to identify and
evaluate the range of potential actions to consider. We also concur that as a payments
fraud scheme may involve multiple institutions and payment methods that may fall
within the remit of different Federal and State agencies, no agency or private-sector
entity can address payments fraud on its own.
As a company that is focused on fighting fraud in online and electronic spaces every
day, we value that the Agencies are prioritizing the support they can provide to the
ongoing battle against payments fraud. Fundamentally, robust anti-fraud solutions must
2
be in place to protect individuals and the financial payments system overall from identity
theft and from other types of frauds and scams occurring online and electronically.

9. What potential changes to regulations (apart from the Board's Regulation
CC, discussed separately below) could address payments fraud and
mitigate the harms from payments fraud to consumers, businesses, and
supervised institutions?
We agree the Agencies should consider potential changes to regulations to help
address payments fraud and mitigate harms from such fraud causes. In our work to
identify and combat identity-related fraud, we have identified clear trends of fraudsters
abusing well-intended regulatory protections. We have identified two regulations that
should be studied for possible amendment to help better combat payment fraud.
First, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) and Regulation B were designed to
ensure equal access to credit, particularly for women who were often denied credit
histories independent of their husbands. While this is an important and meaningful goal,
the rules as implemented have created a significant first party fraud vulnerability. Under
current CFPB official interpretations, if a creditor allows spouses to be added as
authorized users, it cannot refuse to accept non-spouses in that same role.2 As a result,
credit bureaus and creditors cannot meaningfully distinguish between spousal
authorized user accounts -- which ECOA sought to protect -- and non-spousal
“piggybacking” accounts sold in online marketplaces. As explained below, this often
results in permitting ill-intentioned strangers to abuse the credit system.
Specifically, this loophole allows individuals with poor credit files to purchase, through
online clearnet marketplaces, authorized user status as a means of ""credit repair"" or
""credit boosting"" and instantly inherit another person’s long, positive credit history.
Empirical studies, including Federal Reserve research,3 confirm that this practice can
boost a credit score by 20 points or more—enough to move a borrower from subprime
into near-prime or prime status. For lenders, this means extending credit on terms that
do not reflect actual risk. For fraudsters, it creates another tool to manipulate identity
information and exploit the system.

User Account Status and “Piggybacking Credit”, Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2010-23
(Washington, DC: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, March 5, 2010).

To address this issue, regulators should modernize ECOA and Regulation B to allow
creditors to validate the existence of a relationship between the account holder and
authorized user. This update would preserve the consumer protections that ECOA
created, while closing a loophole that enables first party fraud and erodes the reliability
of credit scoring models.
Second, there is a growing trend for fraudsters to abuse protections granted under the
Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). In a credit washing scheme, a consumer fraudulently
disputes a tradeline to have it removed from their credit report by asserting they are the
victim of identity theft. If successful, this can result in a bump to the consumer’s credit
score. The FCRA affords certain rights to victims of identity theft, including the right to
dispute a tradeline on their credit report that resulted from identity theft and is negatively
impacting their credit. Section 605b of the FCRA empowers identity theft victims to
block the reporting of a fraudulent tradeline so that it does not harm the victim’s credit
score. The filing of the FTC’s Identity Theft Report (ITR) initiates a statutorily required
investigatory process, and during that investigation, reporting of the tradeline(s) in
question must be suppressed. Credit washing involves the abuse of these rights,
including the misuse of the ITR process. A consumer, or frequently a credit repair
organization (CROs) on behalf of a consumer (and perhaps without the consumer’s
knowledge), will submit an ITR to either a financial institution or a credit reporting
agency claiming one more negative tradeline is the result of identity theft when no such
theft occurred. This may occur several times over an extended period of time,
prolonging the artificial boost to the consumer’s credit score. Credit washing leads to
higher losses and increased risk, since subsequent creditors will not see the washed
tradelines and potentially misprice the consumer’s risk.4
We fully recognize and appreciate that many consumers rightfully and appropriately
claim identity theft using the Section 605b process and many CROs help consumers
navigate this and other credit repair processes. The protections afforded under the
FCRA are meaningful and appropriate to victims of identity theft. However, there also
are clear signs of abuse. For example, in 2021, the FTC’s Office of Inspector General
found that an FTC analysis of complaints received during the first 6 months of 2021
“revealed significant patterns that suggest a possible fraudulent use of
IdentityTheft.gov.”5 That website is where a consumer files an ITR. We recommend the
banking agencies work with the FTC and CFPB to help close the loopholes to ensure
that bad actors are not abusing a well-intended system for identity theft victims. Such
modifications could include requiring a consumer who files an ITR to also obtain a

police report (which was once a requirement). Such a requirement would likely deter
many would-be credit washers.
Payments Fraud Data Collection and Information Sharing
16. Broadly, how could payments fraud data collection and information
sharing be improved?
In our experience, a key component to effectively identifying and combatting
identity-related fraud is data sharing between the public and private sectors. Federal
and state agencies are frequently the sources of truth -- in other words, only these
agencies, using the data they protect and maintain, can authoritatively answer whether
a key piece of identity information is valid.
For example, SSA’s real-time API-based system, eCBSV, allows financial institutions (or
their service providers) to verify a name, date of birth, and SSN combination against
SSA’s records. As the source of truth for which SSNs have been assigned to a given
name and date of birth, this system makes it possible for financial institutions to approve
more good customers more efficiently, and reduce fraud and risk. The results from
eCBSV are not a definitive answer on whether fraud is occurring, but they go a long way
in identifying potential wrongdoing. While we continue to work with SSA to expand the
capability, efficiency, and effectiveness of eCBSV, it is a strong example of how data
sharing between a federal agency and financial institutions can help combat fraud,
without risking consumers’ privacy.
We encourage the Agencies to explore other ways such partnerships and data sharing
can improve fraud detection and prevention. For example, the Internal Revenue Service
(IRS) operates the Income Verification Express Service, which permits financial
institutions to validate income information directly with the IRS, serving both
underwriting and fraud detection purposes. In 2018, Congress directed the IRS to
modernize and change the system from a fax-based process to API.6 Unfortunately, the
IRS pursued an implementation of this effort in such a way as to render the system
unusable for modern financial services. Correcting this to enable a usability similar to
what the SSA achieved with eCBSV would be an important step in mitigating fraud.

23. What types of payments fraud have most impacted your organization
and its stakeholders? What tactics have criminals employed when
perpetrating these types of payments fraud?
Because we closely support a wide range of US financial institutions’ identity fraud
prevention efforts, SentiLink has a clear window into understanding the evolving face of
fraud. Fraudsters are rapidly adapting their methods, exploiting both legacy payment
systems and emerging technologies. Check fraud remains a significant vulnerability:
images of stolen checks that once numbered in the hundreds per month during 2020
have surged dramatically over the years.7 These are traded on dark web forums and
encrypted messaging channels, underscoring the scale and organization of criminal
markets.
At the same time, the use of Credit Profile Numbers (CPNs) and synthetic identities has
become a core vector for fraud. Vendors openly market these services—often relying on
stolen Social Security numbers from individuals with little or no credit history—to build
fake but convincing credit files. Over time, these synthetic identities are used to open
accounts, secure loans, and ultimately commit “bust-out” schemes, leaving financial
institutions and taxpayers with significant losses.
Criminals are also beginning to weaponize generative AI and deepfake tools in
payments fraud. AI-driven voice cloning, fabricated images, and synthetic likenesses
are being used to bypass liveness checks and other onboarding controls. Fraud
networks exploit shared addresses, legacy email domains, and repeated device or
digital fingerprints to scale their operations. The pace of these technological adaptations
is now outstripping the ability of financial institutions to update defenses, creating
systemic risks.
25. To the extent not already addressed here, are there other actions that
would support stakeholders in identifying, preventing, and mitigating
payments fraud?
The federal government plays an important role in payments fraud identification,
prevention, and mitigation. SentiLink encourages the Agencies to think broadly and
creatively about how the federal government can most effectively help prevent fraud.
It is imperative that the Agencies, financial institutions, and every player in the payments
system “understand the tactics that fraudsters use to bypass...guardrails, like 'synthetic

6
fraud'.... [and] incorporate these patterns and tactics into their technology while also
anticipating how these attack vectors might evolve over time.""8
In our experience, there are solutions available today that can detect identity fraud
faster, more accurately, and at lower cost than legacy solutions. These tools can reduce
fraud, waste, and improper payments and provide a more precise solution that reduces
the need for manual reviews, and create frictionless processes that, for example, utilize
standard PII data fields in an application and eliminate the need for additional
documents, biometrics, or smartphones or cameras. We encourage the Agencies to
explore these tools to better understand them, and to use them in their own systems as
well as encouraging use by their regulated entities.
The Agencies can also turn to innovative fraud prevention providers who offer the ability
to quantify potential fraud exposure and estimated savings through a free retrostudy –
evaluating historic data for fraud at no cost – and who offer trusted and secure products
that are specifically built for regulated environments (such as FedRAMP(™) Ready,
PCI-compliant, and SOC II-compliant) and backed by deep fraud expertise and
continuous innovation in detection techniques. Agencies can seek providers who offer
flexible integration options that, for example, (1) provide API integration – real-time
submission and response flow into existing agency systems; (2) batch processing –
secure SFTP file uploads with results in under 48 hours and no integration needed; (3)
dashboards for investigators – manual review tools that highlight deep risk signals for
casework; and (4) workflow automation support – fraud prevention providers can embed
in end-to-end agency program application and decisioning processes.
Finally, the Agencies could facilitate head-to-head competitive analyses among fraud
prevention providers to evaluate the effectiveness of existing or new fraud solutions for
agencies. These “bakeoffs” typically have the participating companies receive the same
set of data and compete against each other to see whose solution performs the best. By
looking at actual head-to-head product performance, government agencies can
evaluate solutions based on quantifiable results. SentiLink encourages the Agencies to
conduct a bakeoff for existing fraud solutions and potential new fraud solutions. The
result of this bakeoff could help inform future supervisory guidance for regulated
entities.

Attention: Comments-RIN 3064-ZA49
550 17th Street NW
Washington, DC 20429
RE: Request for Information on Potential Actions to Address Payment Fraud
Dear Madam:
New Market Bank (“NMB”) appreciates the opportunity to respond to the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation’s (“FDIC”) Request for Information (“RFI”) on Potential Actions to Address Payment Fraud.
NMB is a community bank with $185MM in assets in the south metro area of the Twin Cities in MN. We
celebrated 120-years of serving our communities this year through small business lending, mortgage
originations and providing all other financial related services. We also work hard to educate and protect
our customers from various fraud schemes which have become increasingly common and hard over the
last few years. We applaud the agencies for issuing this RFI to seek input on ways the FDIC, OCC and
Federal Reserve can take actions to help consumers, businesses and financial institutions mitigate
payments fraud.
Specifically, the bank and our customers have been affected by numerous types of payments fraud
including:
• Internet banking takeovers in order to initiate external transfers to the fraudsters' bank accounts
elsewhere.
• Wire fraud is usually through romance scams such as our customers believe someone they met
online, and are sure they are their significant other, needs money for an investment or to help them
afford to come visit the customer.
• Check fraud through check washing usually after checks were stolen from our customer’s mailbox.
• Mobile deposits where a customer will deposit a check through mobile deposit they received and
then take the cash out and the check is eventually returned as fraudulent.
This is just a summary of some of the frauds we and our customers have experienced. Additional
examples are included below in the responses for the various areas of the RFI.

External Collaboration:
We strongly support enhanced external collaboration between regulatory agencies and financial
institutions of all sizes, particularly through shared fraud intelligence platforms and real-time alerts. We
face challenges in collaborating with other financial institutions on fraud-related matters. The current
scope of 314(b) is too narrow and does not encompass all types of fraud that financial institutions
encounter. This limitation hinders our ability to work together on suspected fraud cases. There is a need
for a more comprehensive method for financial institutions to communicate on fraud-related topics.
Ideas related to expanding external collaboration are:
• We recommend expanding the permissible use of Section 314(b) information sharing to include
fraud beyond money laundering and terrorist financing. This would be a powerful tool to foster
broader collaboration among financial institutions in identifying and preventing a wider range of
fraudulent activities.
• We also request regulators to consider policies that allow financial institutions to share relevant
fraud-related information with trusted relatives or friends of victims or potential victims, when
appropriate, to help prevent further harm and protect vulnerable customers.
Consumer, Business & Industry Education:
As a community bank, customer relationships are our primary focus. Those relationships are often built
face-to-face but increasingly are also built through other platforms such as online banking and social
media. Both in-branch materials and messaging as well as online resources are needed to meet each
customer where their preferences lie. We believe there is a need for accessible, standardized fraud
education materials tailored to both consumers and businesses that community banks could use instead
of having to create resources themselves. These materials could include printed brochures, electronic
messages to use on in-branch TVs or signage, social media posts or videos that could be shared online.
Another resource could be a tool kit to use if the bank wanted to host an information session such as a
lunch and learn with impactful stories highlighting various fraud scams which would make an impact on
the attendee as well as resources the attendees and bank could use to help prevent fraud scams.
Regulation & Supervision:
Overall, payments fraud regulations along with examiner expectations should be tailored to community
banks with tiered compliance requirements. Enhanced supervisory guidance for appropriate controls,
use of technology, reporting and incident response while not imposing new burdens on community
banks would be welcome. Some areas of enhanced guidance could include:
• Regulatory guidance that encourages innovation in fraud detection—while being mindful of the
operational constraints of smaller banks—would further empower us to protect our customers and
maintain trust in the payments system.
• Appropriate safe harbors would improve banks’ ability and willingness to share fraud data without
fear of regulatory or legal repercussions.

The following are responses to the Questions presented in the RFI:
• Question 13:
What is the experience of supervised institutions when trying to resolve these types of interbank
o
disputes regarding allegedly fraudulent checks? Do these types of interbank disputes arise more
frequently in connection with certain types of checks or parties? Our experience is poor,
especially with trying to address altered checks or checks with forged endorsements drawn on
our customers bank account that are deposited into an account at a large bank (bank of first
deposit (BOFD)). We often are unable to speak with an actual person or identify the
department at the larger bank to file a Breach of Warranty Claim as the BOFD is liable. On the
rare occasion when we are able to contact a larger institution, response times can be in excess
of 90 days.
It is also challenging when we’re trying to identify fraudulent checks deposited into our
o
customers bank account that are drawn on an account at a larger bank as we are often unable
to speak to someone at the larger bank and if we are fortunate to speak to someone it is
common practice that they will not provide feedback whether a check is legitimate.
A centralized database of fraud contacts at financial institutions could be beneficial in these
o
scenarios.
We also believe that there should be a way to express concerns about not receiving a response
o
in order to hold these financial institutions responsible as it often feels as if they believe by not
responding the other bank will eat the loss.
What actions could the Board, FDIC, and OCC consider, including potential amendments by the
o
Board to Regulation CC, that could improve supervised institutions’ ability to resolve interbank
disputes over liability for allegedly fraudulent checks? Cashier’s check fraud has significantly
increased in part because fraudsters are aware Reg CC requires banks to provide next day
availability on the first $6,725.00 of the cashier’s check deposited. Technology has increased
substantially to allow for fraudulent cashier’s checks to be created that appear to be authentic
and the time to become aware that the check is not authentic is often greater than the next day
availability rule allows. Therefore, cashier’s checks should be treated consistently with other
types of checks and allow for a greater number of days before they are available.
• Question 14:
a. Have technological advancements in check processing reduced the time it takes for depository
o
institutions to learn of nonpayment or fraud such that funds availability requirements for local
checks and nonproprietary ATMs should be shortened? No, it has not, and unfortunately
fraudsters have access to new technology that allows them to print very realistic looking checks
b. What effects would shortening funds availability requirements have on payments fraud,
o
consumers who rely on timely access to funds, and depository institutions? The shortening of
hold times will increase payment fraud losses because fraudsters will have access to the money
before a consumer or financial institution discovers the fraud. This will result in increased losses
to financial institutions and ultimately consumers.
c. Are there any changes the Board should consider to the expeditious return requirement to
o
better balance providing expeditious notice to the receiving depository institution with ensuring
adequate time for the paying depository institution to investigate potentially fraudulent checks?
Page 4 of 5
Fraudsters are aware of regulatory compliance requirements, including aspects of Reg CC. For
example, some fraudsters are aware that Reg CC allows us to deem an account new for 30 days
and will wait until a new account is seasoned past the 30 days before transacting fraudulent
transactions. Updating Reg CC to mitigate actions of fraudsters would be helpful.
• Question 15:
Is this exception effective in allowing depository institutions to mitigate check fraud while also
o
allowing timely access to funds? No, the time to mitigate check fraud can frequently take more
time than allowed to hold funds. Therefore, hold times should not be shortened and in fact
banks should have flexibility to hold funds longer than Reg CC currently allows when relevant
fraud circumstances exist.
Would depository institutions benefit from further clarification on when it may be appropriate to
o
invoke this exception? Yes, clarification of the “reasonable cause to doubt collectability” of a
check would be helpful including a definition of “altered” and “alteration”.
What are the experiences of businesses and consumers when depository institutions invoke this
o
exception in order to delay the availability of depositors’ funds? The experiences are mixed and
effective communication by our team members is the best tool to help customers understand
that the increased fraud environment is the root cause for most holds currently being placed
and our intention is to help mitigate loss to both the customer and our bank.
Payments Fraud Data Collection and Information Sharing:
Community banks would especially benefit from automated data collection, analysis, and reporting tools
that integrate with existing systems and services and are made available without additional cost
burdens. Smaller community banks especially have budget constraints that often don’t provide the
ability to invest in expensive technology to assist in detecting various types of fraud. The development
of a centralized framework for payments fraud data collection and information sharing would enable
institutions to better understand emerging threats, benchmark their own fraud experiences, and
contribute to a more resilient financial ecosystem. Since most payments flow through the Federal
Reserve Bank, such as checks, ACH transactions and wires, it would be ideal for the Fed to create a
database of known fraud accounts that could be used to filter checks, ACHs, and wires which could assist
with detecting fraudulent transactions.
General Information:
As mentioned above, the bank has experienced a high level of fraud in the last five years. This increased
fraud is spread across types including check fraud, wire fraud, debit card fraud, phishing scams of
customers, internet banking account takeovers, external transfers, mobile deposits, etc. Below are a
couple specific examples of some of the most recent fraud attempts/scams that we have experienced
and the controls we have had to put in place to try and prevent more of this activity.
• Recently, we have encountered a significant amount of fraud involving mobile deposits. New
customers have opened accounts, maintained minimal transactions for a few weeks, and then
deposited fraudulent checks via mobile deposit, withdrawing the funds in cash before the checks are
Page 5 of 5
returned. Long-time customers have also been scammed into depositing fraudulent checks and
withdrawing the cash to send to fraudsters, sometimes using services like Cash App. We have
implemented restrictions on mobile deposits and now manually review the majority of them, which
requires substantial manual effort to mitigate fraud and increased labor costs.
• We recently had an elderly customer trying to deposit a check that was larger than her normal
banking activity and wanted to immediately receive a large amount of cash back. Thankfully our
team members identified this as unusual activity as the check had fraudulent characteristics and
therefore politely but firmly asked our customer questions. Our customer acknowledged the funds
were from an individual that she’s only known through social media for nearly 5 years, had
previously sent large amounts of money to them, filed police reports over 2 years ago regarding
fraud and the individual was now re-contacting her to “repay” her, which she once again fell prey to
their tactics. These chain of events show the amount of time and veracity fraudsters pray on
victims.
• Internet banking, customers can perform external transfers from their accounts at New Market Bank
to their accounts at other financial institutions. Fraudsters have exploited this feature, leading us to
lower the transaction limits and manually review these transactions. Despite these measures, fraud
persisted, and we ultimately disabled external transfers for most customers and restricted new
customers from using this feature. While this decision was necessary to mitigate fraud, it was
disappointing to remove a valuable service from our customers.
Thank you again for the opportunity to provide comments on this RFI. The topic of combatting fraud
and working to prevent it is extremely important to our bank and the community banking industry. We
look forward to working with the FDIC, OCC and FRS as well as other stakeholders to protect our
customers and communities from this growing threat of payment fraud.
Sincerely,

Comment Request (RIN 3064-ZA49)

Ms. Jennifer M. Jones
Deputy Executive Secretary
Attention: Comments—RIN 3064-ZA49
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
550 17th Street NW
Washington, DC 20429
Dear Ms. Jones, Mr. McDonough, and Mr. Gould:
I am the CEO of FNBC Bank, an $825 million asset community bank headquartered in Ash Flat,
AR. I am writing to respond to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC)’s, Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board)’s, and the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation (FDIC)’s request for information (RFI) on payments fraud.
FNBC was founded in 1912 as the Bank of Ash Flat and today serves communities throughout
North Central and Northeast Arkansas, as well as South Central Missouri. Located in the
underserved Ozark foothills, FNBC strives to build profitable relationships and foster economic
development through financial products and customer-driven services. We received Community
Development Financial Institution (CDFI) designation in 2016.
I applaud the agencies for issuing this RFI and seeking input on ways that the OCC, the Federal
Reserve System (FRS), and the FDIC could take actions to help consumers, businesses, and
financial institutions mitigate payments fraud. Community banks continue to be challenged by a
rise in fraud and scams across payment types, so agency action is much needed.
Specifically, FNBC has been affected by payments fraud in the following ways:
Customers receive phone calls that they believe are from FNBC stating they have been
hacked, and they need to wire money to a different bank so they can begin an
investigation. They instruct the customer to say they are wiring money to a friend and to
not tell relatives. One recent customer lost $16,000 and was trying to wire an additional
$19,000 when our community bankers were able to intervene.
Customers may receive an “invoice” stating their payment was received for a known
service, such as Adobe or Microsoft. When they call the number on the invoice, the
fraudster has them download an app onto their computer so they can investigate the
charge. They then watch them log into Online Banking, gaining their credentials. They
will tell the customer they are going to refund them the money they were charged but are
only transferring money from their savings account into their checking. It is always for
too much - $30,000 instead of $300, for example – and they instruct the customer to just
withdraw the money, take it to a local courier and they will get the money back to them.
We recently had a customer lose $130,000 over three transactions in this exact
scenario.
We estimate that between April and August 2025, FNBC customers lost $552,000 to
payments fraud.
Suggested Actions the OCC, Board/FRS, and FDIC Could Take:
External Collaboration:
FNBC supports collaborative stakeholder efforts to address payments fraud. Fraud and
scams persist across state borders, so national stakeholder collaboration is necessary
to effectively combat the problem. However, national efforts must recognize the
resource constraints individual community banks face when deciding whether to
participate.
Consumer, Business, & Industry Education:
Community banks thrive, in part, because of their close customer relationships, so
face-to-face engagement is one of the most effective tools to reach community bank
customers. In-branch material and messaging are especially valuable for community
banks.
Simple videos to share with customers or local businesses/groups such as nursing
homes, large box stores (where fraudsters often have victims buy gift cards), area VFWs,
community centers and schools that can educate on current scams and how to
respond.
Our most vulnerable customers are not always on social media or checking emails
where we regularly provide education on payments fraud. Cost is a barrier for
community banks to mail regular education and information to those customers, so we
would support exploring ways to make mailing these critical education pieces more
affordable.
Regulation and Supervision:
Broadly speaking, payments fraud regulations and examiner expectations need to be
appropriately tailored to community banks with tiered compliance requirements and
deadlines. There are opportunities to enhance supervisory guidance around appropriate
controls, suitable technology, reporting, and incident response, but it is important to
avoid imposing new burdens on community banks.
Check fraud, in particular, remains a significant issue. Community banks are concerned
that some large financial institutions are not exercising sufficient CIP/KYC processes
and opening accounts that are being leveraged by fraudsters. Similarly, community
banks have had significant difficulty resolving interbank disputes regarding fraudulent
checks.
It is nearly impossible to get a person on the phone at a big bank, and once you
do, they make you jump through hoops to get a recall. They simply are not
community banks and do not care for customers the way we do.
When trying to return a check to a larger bank, they do not always detail out their
expectations at the front end, so they will send the recalls back repeatedly for
resubmission. It will be for simple things like the form not being signed by a VP or
higher, or they want each check on a separate form and submitted separately in
its own case even though they were negotiated by the same individual, or even
failing to include (Indemnified Bank) after their bank’s name. They do not read the
whole form, so they will send it back for corrections before they see if there’s
anything else that needs addressed. It simply drags out the process for us and the
customer.
FNBC has had several instances where our customers were scammed and sent
wires to larger banks. Despite the name on the wire not matching the account, the
larger bank accepted it and gave the fraudster customer access to the funds,
which were spent immediately. There needs to be accountability for the bank
accepting the wire to know their customer and what type of activity is suspicious.
Changes to Reg CC could help community banks prevent and mitigate check fraud. For
example, the return deadline related to fraud could be extended, the “reasonable cause
to doubt collectability” exception could be clarified, and relevant definitions could be
revised (e.g., “altered” and “alternation”). However, hold times should not be
shortened; they are an essential tool for banks to detect and prevent check fraud.
Financial institutions should have flexibility to extend hold times under appropriate
circumstances.
Larger banks refused to verify funds on check, so when a hold falls off and the
customer has access to the funds, there is still risk for the check to be returned.
We had this happen to a customer recently. A check was returned 2 days after the
hold fell off and now they have a -$4,000.00 balance, which is devastating for a
customer.
Payments Fraud Data Collection and Information Sharing
While centralized data reporting would be valuable for the ecosystem, agencies should
avoid imposing additional data collection requirements on community banks.
Appropriate safe harbors would improve banks’ ability and willingness to share fraud
data.
Community banks would benefit from automated data collection, analysis, and
reporting tools that are integrated with services they already use and do not come with
additional costs.
Additionally, we believe a regional forum that allowed community banks to share
information on the types of fraud and scams presenting in their area would help bank
employees to spot potential fraud attempts more easily.
Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments on this RFI. FNBC looks forward to
continuing to work together to protect our customers and communities from the growing threat
of payments fraud.
Sincerely,
Marty Sellars

Dear Ms. Jones, Mr. McDonough, and Mr. Gould:
I am commenting on the Regulatory request to address Payments Fraud and how it affects my
Bank: First State Bank, Wrens, GA. We continue to deal with a great deal of fraud in our normal
business activities. We have had several instances of wire fraud, some ACH fraud, and more
check fraud. We are appreciative of regulatory efforts to combat the continuing struggle to
stop fraud and fraudulent actors. Collaboration between more parties would benefit everyone.
Our biggest challenge, particularly on check fraud, is the loose review of mobile check
deposits, especially by the larger, regional and national banks and credit unions. 80 to 90% or
more of the fraudulent checks that we receive clear at one of those banks and almost all are
deposited via mobile check deposits. This is particularly egregious in situations where the
check is not washed but simply endorsed over illegally to another individual. We have had
instances where a company's endorsement was paid over to a person including some checks
that were payable to Public Entities. We humbly request that as part of your consideration on
check and other types of payment fraud, that the larger banks provide more review of
endorsements and the checks themselves to help combat payment fraud. They have engaged
systems that help to catch wire and electronic fraud but can not and do not follow the general
commercial code rules to check and verify endorsements. Also they are typically very difficult
to work with when smaller banks attempt to contact fraud or security departments to obtain
funds back for our customers who have been defrauded. Thank you for giving us this
opportunity to comment.
Sincerely
Haynes Standard, Jr.

Washington, DC 20429
Dear Ms. Jones, Mr. McDonough, and Mr. Gould:
My name is Justin Van Zuiden and I am the Special Assets Officer at Community First Bank of Indiana, an
~$800 million asset community bank located in Kokomo Indiana. I am writing to respond to the request
for information on payments fraud.
Until recently I ran the bank’s fraud department. Our bank prides itself on customer service in all aspects 
of the community. Whether it be giving back to Veteran’s by volunteering throughout the communities we
serve on Veteran’s Day in acts of service to Veteran’s, community shred days, or generous work through
various non-profits – it is a defining piece of our culture.
I am excited that the agencies are seeking input on ways that they could take actions to help consumers,
businesses, and financial institutions mitigate fraud. Consumers continue to be plagued by fraud and
scams, so we are thankful for these agencies call to action.
Our customers have been affected by fraud in any number of ways:
 Wire Fraud  Romance Scams 
 Check Fraud  Work from home schemes
 Phishing scams   Fake Merchants
 Law enforcement scams  Tech scams 
You name it, we’ve seen it.
Consumer, Business, and Industry Education
Starting last year, I began efforts to further educate the community on fraud as we were tired of playing
defense. I began hosting seminars at local non-profits, local community groups, assisted living facilities,
and even the local library to better arm the community in the fight against fraud. These are ongoing with
1
my successor carrying the message far and wide. In our eyes, EVERYONE is a part of our community 
when it comes to fraud – not just our customer base, and we try to get in front of anyone who will listen.
It would be of tremendous help if the various governing agencies creating templates, guides, dos and 
don’ts, helped communities connect and put on fraud seminars to spread the word. I firmly believe
utilizing various platforms (YouTube, Twitch, X, Instagram, FaceBook) and influencers who genuinely
care about others would be an easy way to help get the word out. Additionally, the publications available
from the FTC has been very popular amongst our community – though many banks I’ve worked with
didn’t know they existed.
External Collaboration
 We support collaborative efforts in the fight against fraud. Fraud and scams persist across state 
borders, which is why we created a group known as the Fraud Fighters Coalition. This group is
home to over 30 FIs, from coast to coast, of all shapes and sizes. Creating spaces where tips on
fraud, education, and open dialogue in regard to best practices is crucial in the national crisis we
are facing.
 Resources that assist in connecting law enforcement of all levels with banks of all sizes would be
an invaluable asset. I have talked to many FIs who have struggled in building relationships with
law enforcement that simply don’t know where to start. 
Regulation and Supervision 
 Fraud regulations and examiner expectations need to be tailored to community banks with tiered
compliance requirements and deadlines. There are opportunities to enhance guidance around
appropriate controls, technology, reporting, and incident response, but it is important to avoid
imposing new burdens on community banks.
 Fraud remains a consistent issue in regard to attempting to work with larger FIs not timely
cooperating, or sometimes flat out not responding. I am concerned that some large FIs are not
exercising sufficient CIP/KYC processes and opening accounts that are being leveraged by
fraudsters. More often than not these institutions are defaulting to 60 days before even issuing a
response, again, if one is received at all. This is simply too long and as you know, time is of the
essence in the fraud world. 
 Changes to Reg CC could help community banks prevent check fraud. An example, the return
deadline related to fraud could be extended by an additional day, the “reasonable cause to doubt
collectability” exception could be further clarified, and relevant definitions could be revised (e.g.,
“altered” and “alteration”). Hold times should not be shortened; they are an essential tool for
banks to detect and prevent check fraud. FIs should have flexibility to extend hold times under 
appropriate circumstances, again with further clarification. 
Payments Fraud Data Collection and Information Sharing
 Centralized data reporting would be invaluable for the ecosystem, however, we should avoid
imposing additional data collection requirements on community banks. Appropriate safe harbors
would improve banks’ ability and willingness to share fraud data. We also find that some FIs that
are a part of the 314b program simply only use it when it benefits them and will often never 
respond, hindering investigations.
 Data collection, analysis, and reporting tools that are integrated with services we already use and
do not come with additional costs would be a tremendous asset.

Thank you for the opportunity and time you’ve spent reading comments from banks all over just like ours.
We are looking forward to helping pave the wave to a fraud free future – working hand in hand with 
regulatory agencies and our peers to end fraud.

Dear Ms. Jones, Mr. McDonough, and Mr. Gould:
I am the Compliance Officer of Glenwood State Bank, a $315 million community bank located in
Glenwood, Iowa. I am writing to respond to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC)’s, Board
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board)’s, and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
(FDIC)’s request for information (RFI) on payments fraud.
Glenwood State Bank is a family-owned community bank established in 1899. We have proudly served
our Southwest Iowa communities for over 125 years; through the Great Depression, the farm crisis, the
S&L debacle, the 2008 mortgage collapse and now we are facing unprecedented challenges related to 
payment fraud.
Specifically, the Bank and our customers have been affected by payment fraud in the following ways:
 Wire Fraud resul(cid:415)ng from scams including romance, government impersona(cid:415)on, investment and
similar culmina(cid:415)ng in losses over $250,000.00
 Check Fraud resul(cid:415)ng from employment scams, check washing and fraudulent checks resul(cid:415)ng in
losses over $50,000.00
 Crypto Currency scams, u(cid:415)lizing Crypto ATMs, resul(cid:415)ng in losses over $50,000.00
Community Banks serve elderly customers, as well as consumers and small businesses in rural and
agricultural areas, so education materials tailored to these groups that are available in multiple formats
1
such as in-branch and digital messaging would be valuable. The bank currently provides some of this
educational information to our customers and general public, but additional education is warranted.
Additionally, the Bank supports collaborative efforts to address payments fraud including data collection
and information sharing integrated into services they already use and do not come with additional 
costs. Appropriate safe harbor protections would improve banks’ ability and willingness to share fraud
data. 
Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments on this RFI. The Bank looks forward to continuing to
work with the OCC, FRS, and FDIC, and other stakeholders to protect our customers and communities 
from the growing threat of payments fraud. 
Sincerely, 
Denise Daley-Rix

Attention: Comments—RIN 3064-ZA49
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
550 17th Street NW
Washington, DC 20429
Dear Ms. Jones, Mr. McDonough, and Mr. Gould:
I am the Market President of First Interstate Bank in Cheyenne Wyoming. I am
writing to respond to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC)’s,
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board)’s, and Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)’s request for information (RFI) on
payments fraud. I appreciate the opportunity to provide input on fraud. Simply
put it is now the overarching topic in most everything we do. I do not understand
the regulatory and law enforcement jurisdiction well but is becoming
unsustainable to try and keep our customers informed and properly cautions
while watching fraud occur regularly and then rarely if ever see any law
enforcement outcomes. I consider the following points:
•
When fraud occurs and the bank where the fraud originates is notified,
our industry is slow to share information to support quick resolution or
law enforcement. Locally we have a bank communication group in our
county that timely and effectively shares fraud events for awareness but
interstate fraud resolution seems to be a black hole where we have
difficulty with information sharing. Industry collaboration would be
helpful in heading off losses.
After a loss, there never seems to be investigation or enforcement. Banks
figure out who will take the loss but we never seem to go after the
criminals as an industry and if we do damaged parties do not know about
it. Aggressive enforcement and legal penalties need to be moved to the
forefront of topics in our society. What level of loss is needed to act and
who pursues the cases? Local law enforcement is not equipped or
willing to pursue these cases or cannot based on jurisdiction.
•
Public awareness would be a huge first line of defense rather than dealing
with the aftermath. I see a public service announcement about having a
disaster preparedness box in your house over and over, why can’t we see
repetitive PSA’s regarding fraud, is there any more common disaster than
a family losing their financial wellbeing to fraud? Put out statistics on the
amount of fraud, types of fraud and ways to prevent it. A full-blown
national campaign that runs for an extended period of time. Fraud is still
seen as a victimless crime as the banks write it off, as we know this is not
true.
I applaud the agencies for issuing this RFI and seeking input on ways that the
OCC, the Federal Reserve System (FRS), and the FDIC could take actions to
help consumers, businesses, and financial institutions mitigate payments fraud.
Community banks continue to be challenged by a rise in fraud and scams
across payment types, so agency action is much needed.
Sincerely,
Matthew Pope
NOCO/SOWY Market President

Re: Request for Information on Potential Actions to Address Payments Fraud
Dear Mr. Gould, Mr. McDonough, and Ms. Jones:
On behalf of SardineAI Corp. and its subsidiary SonarAI LLC, which provide financial crime
prevention infrastructure to banks, credit unions, and financial technology firms across the United
States, I appreciate the opportunity to respond to the joint Request for Information on Potential
Actions to Address Payments Fraud.
We commend the agencies for addressing the increasing threat of fraud across checks, ACH, wire
transfers, and instant payments. Fraud in these channels is no longer a series of isolated events at
the customer level; it has become a systemic risk that undermines confidence in the U.S. payment
system.
I. Key Challenges
Fragmented Controls Across Payment Systems
1


 Each rail—ACH, wire, check, and RTP/FedNow—operates independently with distinct
settlement
 rules and dispute processes. There is no industry-wide mechanism to assess counterparty
risk prior to settlement.





 Fraudsters exploit these gaps by rapidly moving funds across rails (e.g., ACH credit
 followed by RTP withdrawal), outpacing dispute and recovery windows.



Funds Availability Misaligned with Fraud Risk


 Current Regulation CC funds availability requirements were designed for paper-based
processes
 and are increasingly exploited in today’s environment of remote deposit capture and near-
instant withdrawals.



 This enables schemes in which fraudulent deposits are immediately made available and
 withdrawn through mule accounts.

Fraud–AML Disconnect

2

 Fraud, onboarding risk, and anti-money laundering obligations are supervised separately.
 Criminals exploit this separation by using fraudulent deposits and mule accounts both to
defraud institutions and to launder proceeds.



Fragmented Intelligence and Delayed Attribution


 Fraud intelligence remains distributed across vendors, processors, and consortia. The
 absence of a unified, real-time system for flagging counterparties prevents early intervention
and increases losses, particularly for smaller institutions.



Persistence of Check Fraud


 Altered and counterfeit checks remain a significant source of losses. Current Regulation
 CC deadlines are not aligned with the velocity of fraud when items are deposited via remote
capture and withdrawn within hours.



II. Recommended Actions
1. Cross-System Counterparty Screening Utility
3


 Establish an industry-wide utility to provide real-time counterparty screening across
 ACH, RTP, FedWire, and check clearing.



 Essential features should include device and behavioral biometrics, network graph analysis
 linking counterparties across systems, and a fraud attribution ledger.





 Participation should be supported by privacy and compliance frameworks, including Gramm-
Leach-Bliley
 Act safeguards and federated learning models.



2. Regulation CC Modernization and Risk-Based Funds Availability


 Permit a risk-based approach to funds availability, allowing hold times to be extended
 when fraud signals are present.



 Clarify definitions of “alteration” and “reasonable cause to doubt collectability” to
 ensure that community banks are not disproportionately burdened.



 Require the use of check image analytics as part of a modernized risk framework.
4



3. Integration of Fraud and AML Oversight


 Encourage supervisory expectations that integrate fraud and AML obligations, particularly
 around mule accounts, scams, and authorized push payment fraud.



4. National Fraud Intelligence Framework


 Formalize public-private fraud intelligence hubs built on anonymized, privacy-compliant
 data.



 Expand and standardize frameworks such as FraudClassifierSM and ScamClassifierSM.



 Require participation from non-bank financial intermediaries, including fintechs, processors,
 and cryptocurrency platforms.



5. Federal Reserve Banks’ Role in Operator-Level Tools
5


 Introduce confirmation-of-payee services for wires and instant payments.



 Create a centralized directory of fraud escalation contacts across institutions.



 Implement an electronic platform for breach-of-warranty claims to expedite resolution
 of check fraud.



 Explore development of an identity fraud classifier to create a baseline detection standard
 across the industry.



6. Encouragement of AI Innovation with Appropriate Safeguards


 Recognize that smaller institutions may lack internal resources to adopt advanced
technologies.



 Establish safe harbors and regulatory sandboxes for supervised use of AI in fraud detection.



 Provide supervisory clarity to reduce regulatory uncertainty that discourages innovation.


6

III. Conclusion
Fraud has become a systemic infrastructure challenge that cannot be addressed by individual
institutions in isolation. A national response built on cross-rail counterparty screening, risk-based
funds availability, integrated fraud–AML oversight, standardized data sharing, and enhanced
operator-level tools is required.
SardineAI and SonarAI are actively developing these capabilities and would welcome the opportunity
to collaborate with regulators, financial institutions, and non-bank providers to advance pilot projects
in these areas.
Thank you for the opportunity to provide these comments. We look forward to supporting the
agencies’ efforts to strengthen the security and integrity of the U.S. payment system.

Ravi Loganathan

Did you know that, according to information recently published by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), consumers reported losing $12.5 billion to fraud in 2024. The second highest category of reported losses came from imposter scams. In these scams, scammers pretend to be someone that you know and trust, such as a representative from your bank or the government, to try to get you to send money or share your personal information.
In fact, the FTC found that “bank impersonation” scams were the most reported scam occurring through text messages in 2022, up nearly twentyfold since 2019. In a bank impersonation scam, scammers pretend to be from a bank and request your personal information, like Social Security numbers, credit card or debit card numbers, or your bank account passwords. The text message often looks like a bank security message and tries to create a sense of urgency to encourage you to provide your personal information.
For example, you might receive a text message asking you to verify a large purchase you didn’t make, and, if you respond, you might get a call from someone pretending to be from the bank’s fraud department, who asks you for your personal information. The scammer then uses the information to steal money from your account. According to the FTC, a typical consumer who falls for this scam lost $3,000, plus was at risk for identity theft.
When you get a text message that makes you worry or seems fishy, take your time and call your bank directly, using a phone number that you are familiar with, like the number provided on your debit or credit card. Do not use a phone number provided by someone you are unfamiliar with or that you think may be a scammer. As an alternative, contact the FDIC before you provide any information when something does not seem right.
Also, do not click on any links in the message or provide information unless you are certain you are dealing with your bank.
Text messages are not the only way scammers will try to reach you. They also use emails (“phishing”) and phone calls (“vishing”). Learn how to identify these scams and better protect yourself and your money.
Criminals also create fake bank websites to mislead and entice people into transferring money or disclosing personal information. Some of these fake bank websites fraudulently use the FDIC name or “Member FDIC” logo to instill a false sense of security. Sometimes, it is hard to tell which websites are real and which are fakes. Before engaging with any website or an entity that claims to be an FDIC-insured bank, it is important to make sure that the website really belongs to an actual FDIC-insured bank.
To help you determine if a website belongs to an FDIC-insured bank, check the FDIC BankFind Suite: Find Institutions by Name & Location , a data resource on the FDIC website. You can look up banks by name or website address to verify whether they are a real FDIC-insured institution. Compare the bank name with the web address or URL. Watch for misspellings, such as letters that are out of place or where the bank name appears as a sub web address of the fake name.
The FDIC can help you verify whether a website is a fake bank or the legitimate website of an FDIC-insured bank, so contact us, and we can verify it for you. If you are in doubt or identify a suspicious website related to FDIC insurance, please contact the FDIC National Center for Consumer and Depositor Assistance (NCDA) at 1-877-ASK-FDIC ( 1-877-275-3342 ) to speak with a deposit insurance specialist or go to FDIC: Information and Support Center - Home .

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
I. Introduction
Payments fraud inflicts significant harm on consumers, businesses, and financial
institutions. Payments fraud also has the potential to erode public trust in—and
undermine the safety, accessibility, and efficiency of—the nation’s payments system,
upon which the U.S. financial system depends. As part of their objectives to promote the
safety of the U.S. financial system, the FRS, FDIC, and OCC have overlapping but also
discrete roles and authorities related to the issue of payments fraud. For example, the
Board, FDIC, and OCC all engage in supervision of financial institutions. In addition to
supervising financial institutions, the FDIC has the distinct mission to maintain stability
and public confidence in the nation’s financial system as the insurer of bank deposits.
The FRS, which includes the Board and the Federal Reserve Banks (Reserve Banks), also
focuses on payment system safety as a payment system operator and catalyst for payment
system improvements. Therefore, the FRS, FDIC, and OCC are each interested in
exploring ways to help mitigate risk of payments fraud. Given that the FRS, FDIC, and
OCC have specific differing roles and authorities, this mitigation could take the form of
collective action where roles align, such as joint supervisory guidance, or independent
7 of 22
action where roles differ, such as changes to the payment systems operated by the
Reserve Banks.
II. Background
While there is no consensus on the definition of “payments fraud,” for purposes of
this RFI, “payments fraud” generally refers to the use of illegal means, including
intentional deception, misrepresentation, or manipulation, to make or receive payments
for personal gain.1 The term “payments fraud” also includes scams, a subset of fraud.2
Many sources indicate that payments fraud is growing. For example, according to
data from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), losses reported for noncard payments
fraud increased 271 percent between 2020 and 2024.3 Data from the U.S. Department of
the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) show that the number
of Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) filed related to check, ACH, and wire fraud have
increased 489 percent between 2014 and 2024.4

https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/federal.trade.commission/viz/FraudReports/FraudFacts (“Payment
& Contact Methods” tab). Specifically, these figures indicate that fraud reports for payments apps or
services, bank transfers or payments, wire transfers, and checks have increased from 145,358 in 2020,
resulting in a loss of $806 million, to more than 188,000 in 2024, resulting in a loss of $2.99 billion.

The rise in check fraud is particularly notable. Numerous sources report
increasing levels of check fraud in recent years, despite overall decreases in check usage.5
Checks can be stolen, altered, or forged. For instance, the physical nature of paper
checks makes them susceptible to theft while in transit or when left in unsecured
locations. Products and services to detect altered or forged checks during the clearing
process have varying degrees of effectiveness given that checks do not inherently include
explicit security features. Checks also contain sensitive information—including the
payor’s name, account number, routing number, address, and signature—that can be used
by criminals to conduct other forms of payments fraud.
A payments fraud scheme may involve multiple institutions and payment
methods, each of which may fall within the remit of different Federal and State agencies.
As a result, and given the scope and complexity of payments fraud schemes, no agency or
private-sector entity can address payments fraud on its own. The Board, FDIC, and OCC
nonetheless may be able to take certain discrete steps, collectively or independently, to
mitigate payments fraud through their various roles discussed further below, such as
regulator and supervisor. In addition, Reserve Banks may be able to further support the
industry in addressing fraud as payments system operator and payments improvement
catalyst.
Therefore, the FRS, FDIC, and OCC are considering whether additional actions
may be warranted, collectively or independently in their different roles. Given the
5 For example, the U.S. Department of the Treasury reports that check fraud in the United States has risen
385 percent since the COVID-19 pandemic. See Department of the Treasury, Treasury Announces
Enhanced Fraud Detection Process Using AI Recovers $375M in Fiscal Year 2023 (Feb. 28, 2024),
https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2134. FinCEN reports that check fraud accounted for
approximately 30 percent of fraud-related SARs filed in 2023. See SAR Stats,
https://www.fincen.gov/reports/sar-stats.

complexity and scope of payments fraud, input and engagement from a variety of
stakeholders will be helpful to identify and evaluate the range of potential actions to
consider.
III. Request for Information
As explained below, comment is requested on five potential areas for
improvement and collaboration that could help mitigate payments fraud:
• External collaboration (questions 1–4)
• Consumer, business, and industry education (questions 5–8)
• Regulation and supervision (questions 9–15)
• Payments fraud data collection and information sharing (questions 16–20)
• Reserve Banks’ operator tools and services (questions 21–22)
Commenters are also invited to provide perspectives related to payments fraud more
generally (questions 23-26).
Where comments apply to only a subset of the FRS, FDIC, and OCC, please
identify the relevant entity or entities.
External Collaboration
The FRS, FDIC, and OCC collaborate with stakeholders in various ways to
support the safety and efficiency of the U.S. financial system. For example, the Board,
FDIC, and OCC, together with other Federal and State agencies, issued guidance on elder
financial exploitation.6 More recently, the Reserve Banks collaborated with various

industry stakeholders to launch the FraudClassifierSM model in 2020 and
ScamClassifierSM model in 2024 to help address the industry-wide challenge of
inconsistent classifications for payments fraud.7 Additionally, the FRS in its role as
payment system improvement catalyst worked with the payments and banking industry
and other stakeholders to develop strategies for improving the U.S. payments system,
which resulted in the introduction of instant payments in the United States.8 There may
be opportunities to facilitate further collaboration among industry stakeholders to better
address payments fraud. Commenters are invited to respond to the following questions:
1. What actions could increase collaboration among stakeholders to address
payments fraud?
2. What types of collaboration, including standard setting, could be most effective in
addressing payments fraud? What are some of the biggest obstacles to these types
of collaboration?
3. Which organizations outside of the payments or banking industry might provide
additional insights related to payments fraud and be effective collaborators in
detecting, preventing, and mitigating payments fraud?
4. Could increased collaboration among Federal and State agencies help detect,
prevent, and mitigate payments fraud? If so, how?

Consumer, Business, and Industry Education
Consumers, businesses, financial institutions, and other industry stakeholders
currently have access to education on a range of financial topics, including payments
fraud.9 However, there may be a need for further education specific to payments fraud.
Effective payments fraud education could, for example, help industry stakeholders
identify suspected payments fraud and better inform affected parties about what steps to
take following an incident of payments fraud. The effectiveness of any payments fraud
education, however, may be undermined by the ever-evolving nature of payments fraud,
the highly specific and sensitive nature of these crimes, and the range of potentially
inconsistent guidance from multiple sources.
To assist in developing potential new payments fraud education, commenters are
invited to respond to the following questions:
5. In general, what types of payments fraud education are most effective, and why?
Would different audiences (for example, industry and consumers) benefit from
different types of payments fraud education?
6. Would additional education informing consumers and businesses about safe
payment practices be helpful to reduce payments fraud and promote access to
safe, secure payment options?
9 For example, the OCC recently launched “Safe Money,” a series of informational facts sheets to help
consumers recognize and avoid common financial frauds and scams at https://www.occ.gov/publications-
and-resources/publications/safe-money/index-safe-money.html. The Federal Reserve offers consumer
advice and educational resources on its website at
https://www.federalreserve.gov/consumerscommunities/fraud-scams.htm and through each Reserve Bank’s
website. The Federal Reserve also provides consumer alerts, an avenue for consumer complaints, and other
relevant resources on payments fraud at https://www.federalreserveconsumerhelp.gov. The FDIC provides
periodic newsletters to consumers, providing practical guidance on how to become a smarter, safer user of
financial services, including helpful hints, quick tips, and common-sense strategies to protect and stretch
your hard-earned dollars. This includes topics such as scammers, fake banks, or fraud against the elderly.
See https://www.fdic.gov/consumer-resource-center/fdic-consumer-news for more information.

7. Which approaches could make existing payments fraud education more effective?
For example, would targeting outreach to particular audiences or conducting
additional education in collaboration with other key stakeholders be effective?
8. Are current online resources effective in providing education on payments fraud?
If not, how could they be improved?10
Regulation and Supervision
While no agency has plenary regulatory or supervisory authority over the U.S.
payments system, the Board, FDIC, and OCC have certain limited, and in some cases
unique, statutory authorities that may apply to payments fraud.11 For example, the
Board, FDIC, and OCC supervise their respective financial institutions for compliance
with their obligations under the Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering regime to
identify, prevent, and report illicit financial activity including fraud. Additionally, the
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act requires the protection of nonpublic personal information as
implemented by the Interagency Guidelines Establishing Information Security
Standards.12 The Board, FDIC, and OCC also supervise their respective financial

and-resources/publications/safe-money/index-safe-money.html; and https://www.occ.gov/topics/consumers-
and-communities/consumer-protection/fraud-resources/index-fraud-resources.html.
11 While no single Federal agency has regulatory authority to address all aspects of payments fraud, there
are a variety of Federal and State laws and regulations applicable to payments fraud detection, mitigation,
and resolution, often specific to the type of transaction and parties involved.
12 The Interagency Guidelines Establishing Information Security Standards (Guidelines) set forth standards
pursuant to section 39 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, 12 U.S.C. 1831p-1, and sections 501 and
505(b), 15 U.S.C. 6801 and 6805(b), of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. These Guidelines address standards
for developing and implementing administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect the security,
confidentiality, and integrity of customer information. These Guidelines also address standards with respect
to the proper disposal of consumer information pursuant to sections 621 and 628 of the Fair Credit
Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. 1681s and 1681w).
13 of 22
institutions for compliance with consumer protection laws and regulations, such as the
Expedited Funds Availability Act (implemented in Regulation CC), the Electronic Fund
Transfer Act (implemented in Regulation E), the Truth in Lending Act (implemented in
Regulation Z), and prohibitions on unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices.13
Although the Board, FDIC, and OCC believe that they are exercising their authorities
appropriately, there may be opportunities to take additional regulatory or supervisory
actions to address payments fraud within their authorities and, where appropriate, in
coordination with other agencies.
In considering potential additional regulatory or supervisory actions to mitigate
payments fraud, the Board, FDIC, and OCC seek comment on the following questions.
Additionally, there may be opportunities specific to check fraud that the Board could
consider with respect to Regulation CC given its rule-writing authority, which is
discussed separately below.
9. What potential changes to regulations (apart from the Board’s Regulation CC,
discussed separately below) could address payments fraud and mitigate the harms
from payments fraud to consumers, businesses, and supervised institutions?
10. The Board, FDIC, and OCC have issued supervisory guidance on numerous
topics that relate to payments fraud detection, prevention, and mitigation.14 Is
13 The Expedited Funds Availability Act (EFA Act), among other things, prescribes the maximum
permissible hold periods for checks and other deposits. The Board implements certain provisions of the
EFA Act with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).
14 The Board, FDIC, and OCC have issued supervisory guidance on operational risk management,
compliance risk management, third-party risk management, and model risk management. For example, the
Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, of which the Board, FDIC, and OCC are members,
issued guidance that provides financial institutions with examples of effective authentication and access
risk management principles, and practices for customers, employees, and third parties accessing digital
banking services and information systems. See Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council,
Authentication and Access to Financial Institution Services and Systems (Aug. 11, 2021),
14 of 22
existing supervisory guidance related to payments fraud sufficient and clear? If
not, what new or revised supervisory guidance should the Board, FDIC, and OCC
consider issuing on this topic within the respective authorities?
11. How might new or revised supervisory guidance assist small community banks in
detecting, preventing, and mitigating payments fraud?
12. What is the experience of consumers and businesses when supervised institutions
place holds on depositors’ funds because of suspected payments fraud?
(Regulation CC’s “reasonable cause to doubt collectability” exception is
discussed separately below.)
a) For instance, how frequently are consumers and businesses affected by
holds, delays, or account freezes, and how responsive are supervised
institutions to inquiries from consumers and businesses regarding these
issues?
b) Do current disclosure requirements effectively address consumer and
business concerns when supervised institutions hold customer funds due to
suspected payments fraud? For example, should changes be considered
with respect to permissible customer communications under SAR
confidentiality rules?
https://www.ffiec.gov/guidance/Authentication-and-Access-to-Financial-Institution-Services-and-
Systems.pdf. The Board, FDIC, and OCC, together with other Federal and State agencies, issued guidance
on elder financial exploitation. See Interagency Statement on Elder Financial Exploitation (Dec. 4, 2024),
https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20241204a.htm;
https://www.fdic.gov/system/files/2024-12/interagency-statement-on-elder-financial-exploitation.pdf; and
https://www.occ.gov/topics/consumers-and-communities/consumer-protection/fraud-resources/index-fraud-
resources.html. As required by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Federal banking agencies have issued
interagency guidelines establishing information security standards. See, e.g., 12 CFR part 208, app. D-2,
and part 225, app. F. Finally, OCC Bulletin 2019-37 outlines sound fraud risk management principles at
https://www.occ.treas.gov/news-issuances/bulletins/2019/bulletin-2019-37.html.

13. The Board, FDIC, and OCC have received complaints from supervised
institutions regarding challenges in resolving disputes about liability for allegedly
fraudulent checks.15 What is the experience of supervised institutions when trying
to resolve these types of interbank disputes regarding allegedly fraudulent checks?
Do these types of interbank disputes arise more frequently in connection with
certain types of checks or parties? What actions could the Board, FDIC, and OCC
consider, including potential amendments by the Board to Regulation CC, that
could improve supervised institutions’ ability to resolve interbank disputes over
liability for allegedly fraudulent checks?
Although the Board is not proposing any changes to Regulation CC at this time,
the Board seeks comment on the following questions:
14. Regulation CC seeks to balance prompt funds availability with the risk of checks
being returned unpaid for reasons that include fraud. What potential amendments
to Regulation CC would support timely access to funds from check deposits while
providing depository institutions with sufficient time to identify suspected
payments fraud?
a) Have technological advancements in check processing reduced the time it
takes for depository institutions to learn of nonpayment or fraud such that
funds availability requirements for local checks and nonproprietary ATMs
should be shortened?16
15 The Board, OCC, and FDIC have each established mailboxes to receive interbank complaints about this
issue concerning their supervised financial institutions.
16 The funds availability requirements for cash deposits, wire transfers, and government and certain other
types of checks are established by the EFA Act. See 12 U.S.C. 4002(a). The EFA Act requires the Board
and CFPB to reduce the time periods for certain other check and ATM deposits to as short a time as
16 of 22
b) What effects would shortening funds availability requirements have on
payments fraud, consumers who rely on timely access to funds, and
depository institutions?
c) Are there any changes the Board should consider to the expeditious return
requirement to better balance providing expeditious notice to the receiving
depository institution with ensuring adequate time for the paying
depository institution to investigate potentially fraudulent checks?17
15. Regulation CC provides six exceptions that allow depository institutions to extend
deposit hold periods for certain types of deposits, including deposits for which the
depository institution has reasonable cause to doubt the collectability of a
check.18 Is this exception effective in allowing depository institutions to mitigate
check fraud while also allowing timely access to funds? Would depository
institutions benefit from further clarification on when it may be appropriate to
invoke this exception? What are the experiences of businesses and consumers
when depository institutions invoke this exception in order to delay the
availability of depositors’ funds?
possible and equal to the period of time achievable for a receiving depository institution to reasonably
expect to learn of the nonpayment of most items for each category. 12 U.S.C. 4002(d)(1). In October
2024, an interested person submitted a rulemaking petition to the Board and CFPB requesting that both
agencies engage in a rulemaking process to shorten maximum permissible hold times for checks and funds
deposited by customers. The Board views this rulemaking petition as an additional consideration related to
the issuance of this RFI. In response to the growth in electronic processing, the Reserve Banks reduced the
number of their paper check-processing offices from 45 in 2003 to a single office in 2010. The
consolidation resulted in all checks being considered ""local checks"" under Regulation CC.
17 Regulation CC requires a depository institution that determines not to pay a check to return the check
expeditiously so that receiving depository institutions are more likely to learn of a return before making
funds available. See 12 CFR 229.31(b).
18 See 12 CFR 229.13(e).

Payments Fraud Data Collection and Information Sharing
Payments fraud data, such as value and volume of fraudulent payments and
industry negative lists, is currently collected in an incomplete, non-standardized, ad hoc,
and fragmented way.19 For example, not all entities in the payments and banking
industry collect payments fraud data, especially authorized payments that are a part of a
scam or fraud. Further, existing data sources may focus on particular payment methods,
types of payments fraud, or segments of the industry, and may use different definitions of
payments fraud. Further promoting, standardizing, and centralizing payments fraud data
collection and information sharing could provide a more comprehensive understanding of
the prevalence and impact of payments fraud. These improvements also could aid in
identifying payments fraud schemes that are being repeated across payment methods and
institutions, allowing for the development of more-informed, holistic strategies to address
payments fraud.
However, there may be barriers to improving payments fraud data collection and
information sharing. Payments fraud may be underreported because of the reluctance of
victims to report fraud due to embarrassment or shame, confusion regarding the proper
reporting channel, and a perception that reporting does not lead to remediation. Further,
19 For example, the FTC maintains a website where consumers can report payments fraud. See
https://reportfraud.ftc.gov. The FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center is the main federal law
enforcement hub for reporting cyber-enabled crime, which includes payments fraud. See
https://www.ic3.gov/AnnualReport/Reports/2024_IC3Report.pdf. In addition, depository institutions are
required to file SARs with FinCEN following suspected incidents of payments fraud. FRS has previously
collected payments fraud data in connection with its Federal Reserve Payments Study, which it published
in 2014 and 2018. See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, The 2013 Federal Reserve
Payments Study: Recent and Long-Term Payment Trends in the United States: 2000-2012 (July 2014),
https://www.frbservices.org/binaries/content/assets/crsocms/news/research/2013-fed-res-paymt-study-

potential risks associated with sharing payments fraud–related information may prevent
sharing across stakeholders.
To assist in potentially promoting improved payments fraud data collection and
information sharing, commenters are invited to respond to the following questions:
16. Broadly, how could payments fraud data collection and information sharing be
improved?
17. What barriers limit the collection and sharing of payments fraud data between
industry stakeholders, and how could these barriers be alleviated? For example,
have specific barriers limited development of solutions or participation in
bilaterial or multilateral payments fraud data collection and information sharing?
What changes would address these barriers?
18. What role should the FRS, FDIC, or OCC take in supporting further
standardization of payments fraud data? For instance, can the FRS better leverage
or improve the FraudClassifierSM and ScamClassifierSM models?
19. What types of payments fraud data, if available, would have the largest impact on
addressing payments fraud? If these data are not currently being collected or
shared, what entities are best positioned to collect and share such data?
20. Is there a need for centralized databases or repositories for the sharing of
payments fraud data across entities? What legal, privacy, or practical risks and
challenges could such a centralized database or repository pose? Which entities
are best positioned to develop and participate in a centralized database or
repository?
19 of 22
Reserve Banks’ Operator Tools and Services
The Reserve Banks offer check processing, ACH transfers, instant payments, and
wire services, among other services. In this operational role, the Reserve Banks have
taken important steps to prevent and mitigate payments fraud. For example, the Reserve
Banks provide risk management tools and services that participating financial institutions
may use as part of their payments fraud detection, prevention, and mitigation programs.20
The FRS believes that there may be further opportunities for the Reserve Banks, as a
payments system operator, to provide additional tools and services designed to reduce
payments fraud.
In considering potential additional actions the Reserve Banks can take in their
operator role to mitigate payments fraud, commenters are invited to respond to the
following questions:
21. How can the Reserve Banks enhance their existing risk management tools and
services, operations, rules, or procedures to better meet the needs of participating
financial institutions in addressing payments fraud? For example, should the
Reserve Banks consider requiring fraud reporting for payment rails (as they
already do for the FedNow® Service) or adopting any particular payments fraud
standards?
20 See https://www.frbservices.org for more information on Reserve Bank financial services, including risk
management and fraud tools and services. Examples of these tools and services include FedDetect®
Anomaly Notification for FedACH® Services, FedACH® Exception Resolution Service, FedDetect®
Duplicate Notification for Check Services, FedACH® Risk Origination Monitoring Service, FedACH®
RDFI File Alert Service, FedPayments® Reporter for Check Services Corporate Payor Report, FedNow®
Service network- and participant-level transaction limits, and FedNow® Service participant defined
negative lists.
20 of 22
22. Are there risk management tools or services that the Reserve Banks should
consider offering or expanding, such as a) developing a payments fraud contact
directory for financial institutions, b) offering tools that can provide notification
of atypical payment activity, or c) introducing confirmation of payee services to
help mitigate fraudulent payment origination?21
General Questions
In addition to the more specific questions above, commenters are invited to
respond to the following general questions related to payments fraud:
23. What types of payments fraud have most impacted your organization and its
stakeholders? What tactics have criminals employed when perpetrating these
types of payments fraud?
24. What measures, including technological solutions or services, have been most
effective in identifying, preventing, and mitigating payments fraud at your
institution? Are there actions that consumers can take that help institutions? For
example, do financial institutions find it helpful when consumers alert the
institution in advance when making large purchases, transferring large amounts of
money, and traveling abroad?
25. To the extent not already addressed here, are there other actions that would
support stakeholders in identifying, preventing, and mitigating payments fraud?
21 Some payments systems have implemented services known as confirmation of payee, which are designed
to reduce payments fraud by enabling senders to review key payment information, such as the name
associated with the intended account.

26. Are there specific actions that commenters believe could encourage the use of
payment methods with strong security features?

It’s December and the holiday shopping season is underway. According to the FDIC Consumer News , December is a good time to think about protecting your personal information while you are online. As we spend more time online, it is important to stay safe and to think about protecting personal information.
If you are planning on teaching Money Smart sessions, please consider sharing information about protecting your identity and avoiding scams while online. To learn more, please read the following resources:
Join us on social media using the #FDICMoneySmart and show us the Money Smart products in action!
According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) , approximately 12,000 consumers lost nearly $73 million due to scams during the 2022 holiday season . Money Smart provides helpful tools and modules to educate consumers about identity theft and other types of scams.
Students as young as high school freshmen can learn about identity theft and scams from Money Smart for Young People Module 20 - Protect Yourself. From phishing, pharming, and text messaging scams to detecting employment fraud, students learn how to spot the deceptions. After learning about different ways that their identity might be compromised, students learn about consumer protection laws and discover ways to prevent identity theft.
If you want to include fake job offer scams and scams against immigrants, you can find information at Scams and Identity Theft | consumer.gov .
To supplement your Money Smart Modules, you can use videos like FDIC Explains: Phishing and FDIC Explains: Scam Calls . You can also use the FDIC Consumer News articles: Scammers and Fake Banks , Avoid Scams While Shopping Online for Bargains and Avoiding Scams and Scammers .
You can find Protecting Your Identity and Other Assets in How Money Smart Are You? if you prefer playing games while you learn.
Another game to supplement the FDIC Money Smart lessons and help consumers, is the St. Louis Federal Reserve’s The Three D's of Identity Theft .

U.S. Army Sergeant Major (Retired) Jesse Cavalier is busy. After retiring from the Army, Cavalier wanted to give back to his community, especially youth. When he realized that many young people in his community were not financially informed, he set about looking for a solution. After contacting the FDIC to discuss the Money Smart financial education program, Cavalier organized a large group of volunteers from the Renew Church in Baker, Louisiana, to help implement his vision of bringing financial education to his community. On February 24, 2024, the FDIC led a Money Smart for Young Adults train-the-trainer session for eighteen volunteers.
Cavalier and the volunteers created a yearlong schedule to teach the twelve Money Smart for Young Adults (MSYA) modules. Volunteers signed up for one or more monthly sessions. He felt that it was important that the volunteers not be overburden by asking that they sign-up for multiple sessions, but he was pleasantly surprised when numerous volunteers signed up for two or more sessions. Within weeks of attending the train-the-trainer sessions, volunteers held their first session with twelve youth and young adult attendees. Cavalier and the volunteers want to make sure the youth are financially prepared to go to college or to buy a car. The young people, who have bank accounts with debit cards, after going through the Bank On It module, have a better understanding of managing their accounts. This group of participants have completed half of the modules. Once they finish the program in early 2025, they will receive a stipend.
Cavalier said that he has seen the results of the training. “One participant,” Cavalier said, “knew his mother had come into some money. After the module on saving, he went home to find out his mother had put her money in a regular savings account. Together, they went to the bank and moved the money to CDs and a money market account.”
Due to the program’s success, they started offering classes to adults. Their current students range in ages from 41 to 93. To supplement the training, the adults get one-on-one coaching. After completing the budget module, participants were encouraged to keep receipts of their monthly expenditures. They will go through them with their coach to develop a spending and saving plan. “Money Smart has been very useful in having these conversations,” said Cavalier.
Renew Church’s financial education program did not end there. Cavalier hosted an FDIC Financial Literacy session on September 28, 2024, with veterans. In October, he provided financial literacy at Soar Community Church Men’s Conference to approximately 100 participants.
Due to their success, other churches in their community have reached out to Cavalier to learn more about the Money Smart program. “We have been very successful using the Money Smart and other FDIC resources,” said Cavalier. “I would tell others using Money Smart to know your audience. Spend less time on lecture and more time on hands-on application.”
The December 2024 FDIC Consumer News article titled: What you Should Know About Gift Cards provides information on gift cards and how they can be a convenient present for the holidays and special occasions. While they seem simple, it is important that both the giver and the recipient read the details for each card to avoid any misunderstandings.
The old saying goes: a good speech has three parts: 1) tell them what you are going to tell them, 2) tell them what you want to tell them, and 3) tell them what you told them. As found in FDIC Money Smart instructional materials, outlining a module’s learning objectives, and reemphasizing key points throughout the presentation—and at its conclusion—will provide participants with the key takeaways intended.

National Cyber Security Awareness is observed in October. According to the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), implementing safe cybersecurity best practices is important for individuals and organizations.  Using strong passwords, updating your software, and thinking before you click on suspicious links will improve your online safety. The FDIC is well aware of identity theft and offers the Protecting Your Identity and Other Assets as part of the FDIC How Money Smart Are You?
For more information on how to protect you and your family from identity theft, please visit the resources below:
The National Hispanic Heritage Month, celebrated between September 15 and October 15 each year, acknowledges the accomplishments and significant contributions of Hispanic Americans to our history, economy, and culture. This year’s theme, ""Pioneers of Change (Pioneros del cambio): Shaping the Future Together,"" is intended to capture the ""spirit of innovation, resilience, and unity that define the Hispanic community.""
The FDIC is committed to advancing Financial Education for Hispanic/Latino individuals by, among other things, providing free, easily accessible materials, information, and resources in English and Spanish.
The Money Smart financial education program equips individuals with the necessary knowledge, tools, and resources to manage their finances effectively, access mainstream banking, and cultivate positive banking relationships. The Money Smart family offers several programs in Spanish:
Additionally, this year the FDIC will host two virtual seminars to highlight how our programs can be utilized in efforts to educate the public in preventing fraud and scams. The first one will take place October 3, 2024 at 2:00 pm ET and will be presented in Spanish. The second will be on October 10, 2024 at 2:00 pm ET and will be in English. To register, click here .
“Money Smart has been extremely helpful material,” said Mr. Carlos Andres Lopez, Special Programs Director at MIRA USA. “We’ve been able to do 15 trainings in the last year for 60-70 volunteers.”
MIRA USA is a non-profit organization that promotes the social integration of immigrants into the United States. With a presence in 11 states, MIRA USA was part of the Juntos FDIC Pilot Program. The Juntos FDIC pilot was a year-long FDIC initiative expanding financial education in the U.S. Hispanic population through collaborations with Hispanic Serving Organizations, and the ultimate goal of disseminating FDIC Money Smart resources in English and Spanish.
Mr. Lopez said MIRA USA has grown very quickly. “We have 1,200 volunteers in 20 cities on the East Coast.” Plans to start a team in Boston are in the works for the Fall.
MIRA USA uses Money Smart for Adults, Money Smart for Small Business, and How Money Smart Are You? “We take it one step at a time,” said Mr. Lopez. “So we may do one thing at a time, like credit building.” In fact, they did a course a couple of weeks ago in New York City on credit scores and had 35 attendees.
MIRA USA is quick to respond to the financial needs of their communities. For example, when their communities saw mail theft of utility bills of seniors where thieves were calling consumers to pay the stolen bills, MIRA USA hosted two workshops using Money Smart for Older Adults to address elder abuse.
MIRA USA also launched a Youth Leadership Program to motivate young Latino leaders. Laura Bedoya, Vice President, leads the group that has 90 committee members. The leadership program has roles like president and every two years the committee leaders rotate and change. The program focuses on three areas: women leadership, business and entrepreneurship, and research. The goal is to grow that particular community.
Mr. Lopez and Ms. Bedoya do not conduct financial literacy training alone. “We have 100 trained volunteers,” said Mr. Lopez. “Sixty of them are from the Youth Leadership Program.”
“We are particularly thankful for the FDIC allowing us to use the Money Smart methodology for our workshops. In 2024, as of today, we conducted 24 workshops focused on financial education using the Money Smart in 15 cities across the United States, benefiting 823 members of our community, including business owners, adults, and seniors. Additionally, we held our 2024 Housing Fair in Atlanta, where we promoted the benefits of homeownership to our Atlanta community, providing information on responsible home buying to 1,200 members of the community. We sincerely appreciate all the support from FDIC,” said Mr. Lopez.
Congratulations to MIRA USA and their entire team for all of their successes!

I. Executive Summary
The National Consumer Law Center (“NCLC”),1 on behalf of our low-income clients, is pleased
to respond to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency’s (OCC), the Board of Governors of
the Federal Reserve System’s (Board), Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s (FDIC), and the
National Credit Union Administration’s (NCUA) (collectively “the Agencies”) Proposed Notice
of Rulemaking on Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism Program
Requirements.2
In general, we support efforts to strengthen and modernize the anti-money laundering (AML)
and countering the financing of terrorism (CFT) program requirements for financial institutions.
However, as we communicated in our response to FinCEN’s proposed rule,3 more actions and
measures are required to address fraud and protect vulnerable communities.
The Agencies should partner with FinCEN to take additional steps to emphasize the importance
of fraud prevention and fraud detection in combating money laundering and financing of
terrorism within the U.S. banking and payments system. The Agencies should collect more
information about payment fraud, promote information sharing, and urge FinCEN to update the
Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) process to catch information about accounts that receive
fraudulent funds.
We also believe more clarity and guidance need to be included in the proposed rule, as well as in
any implementing guidance and examination manuals, to ensure that financial institutions do not
define risk too broadly in a way that impacts financial inclusion. Financial institutions should not
consider credit risk as a factor in developing and implementing an AML/CFT program. Without
clarity, blunt-fisted, opaque identification requirements exclude vulnerable consumers from the
U.S. banking system and allow for discrimination. More specificity and clarity are also necessary
so that overly aggressive Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) AML/CFT programs targeting fraud do not
lead to bank account closures and freezes. And when accounts are closed or frozen due to
suspicious activity, the Agencies should clarify what banks may communicate with their
customers so that innocent consumers can rebut incorrect conclusions and swiftly restore access
to their funds.

Additionally, the Agencies along with FinCEN should protect specific vulnerable populations
such as immigrants, domestic violence survivors, and justice-impacted individuals. These groups
experience financial exclusion that is often exacerbated by overly broad BSA AML/CFT
programs.
Finally, the Agencies should be extremely cautious and vigilant about the use of artificial
intelligence (AI) in AML/CFT programs and BSA compliance.
II. The BSA regime plays an important role in combatting fraud, and the Agencies
should take additional steps to address payment fraud.
A. The Agencies should collect more information about payment fraud and
promote more information sharing.
To prevent and detect payment fraud, it is important to aggregate fraud reports from various
sources to detect patterns. (However, depending on how the reports are shared and used,
compliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act may be required.)
In the United States, regulatory oversight and supervision of actors in the payments space depend
on several factors including the size, type, and nature of a financial institution,4 as well as the
extent to which the activities5 undertaken by an institution are covered by existing law. As a
result, no centralized federal agency receives or collects all data about payment fraud.6
Additionally, defrauded consumers may report fraud to the Federal Trade Commission, the FBI’s
internet crimes division, and/or the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, as well as state or
local law enforcement agencies, leading to differing and incomplete snapshots of payment fraud.
Although these agencies may share some fraud data with each other or the general public,
sharing is sporadic and there is no mandate to do so. 7
Presently, financial institutions, payment processors, and payment operators are not required to
report the incidents of payment fraud experienced by their customers/consumers to any federal
agency. Financial institutions are required to file a suspicious activity report (SAR) for large
transactions in certain circumstances if they suspect their customer is engaged in fraudulent
activity, but they are not required to report smaller fraudulent transactions or instances where
4 Depending on the size and activity, a financial institution engaging in payment activity could be subject to
supervision by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation, the National Credit Union Administration, and/or the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
Otherwise, the institution could be subject to state regulatory supervision under a state bank charter or money
transmitter license. Some payment actors may not be subject to any supervision, though they are still required to
comply with all laws.
5 Though not covered by these comments, institutions engaged in payments through cryptocurrency and/or
stablecoin face the possibility of oversight by the prudential regulators as well as Commodities Futures Trading
Commission, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and/or the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
6 Of any type, including fraud through P2P apps, bank-to-bank transfers, or check fraud.
7 Though certain fraudulent activity is required to be reported to FinCEN, and the Federal Reserve Board will collect
fraud data through FedNow. However, FinCEN does not publicly share the data it collects, and it is unclear how the
Federal Reserve Board will utilize and disseminate the data it will collect for FedNow.
2
their clients have been victimized by fraud.8 Even with SARs mandatory reporting, the
information collected by FinCEN relies heavily on the discretion of a financial institution, and
reporting depends on whether the fraud or potential fraud is discovered/flagged by the reporting
institution and whether the transaction is large enough to warrant reporting.9
At a minimum, and if the Agencies do not already include specific fraud questions in their
examination manuals, the Agencies should amend supervision and examination manuals and
policies to request information about fraud- both unauthorized fraud as well as fraudulently
induced payments (also known as authorized payment fraud). The Agencies should publish
annual data on how many fraud incidents are reported by customers of the financial institutions
they supervise, how these fraud incidents are classified (unauthorized v. authorized), and how
these fraud incidents are resolved. This information can be similar to the “Supervisory
Highlights” reports the CFPB publishes10 to share key examination findings on fraud.
In addition, more information sharing among all the different players in the US payment systems
is needed. Players in the banking and payments industry have already recognized the need for
fraud information sharing, and some payment operators do collect data about fraud. The Federal
Reserve Board collects reports of fraud on FedNow as specified under Regulation J, Subpart C
and keeps a “Negative List” of suspicious accounts that is shared with its participants.11 The
Clearing House also collects fraud reports for RTP® (its real time payments platform), and Early
Warning Systems (EWS), the owner of Zelle, collects reports of fraud occurring on Zelle, though
it is unclear if this information is shared widely among users.12 Initiatives such as SardineX13 and
Beacon14 were also launched in response to increased fraud in digital payments and real-time
8 “Dollar Amount Thresholds- Banks are required to file a SAR in the following circumstances: insider abuse
involving any amount; transactions aggregating $5,000 or more where a suspect can be identified; transactions
aggregating $25,000 or more regardless of potential suspects; and transactions aggregating $5,000 or more that
involve potential money laundering or violations of the BSA. It is recognized, however, that with respect to
instances of possible terrorism, identity theft, and computer intrusions, the dollar thresholds for filing may not
always be met. Financial institutions are encouraged to file nonetheless in appropriate situations involving these
matters, based on the potential harm that such crimes can produce. Even when the dollar thresholds of the
regulations are not met, financial institutions have the discretion to file a SAR and are protected by the safe harbor
provided for in the statute.” From FDIC “Connecting the Dots… The Important of Timely and Effective Suspicious

3
payment systems. However, the information shared is not available to the public and may be
industry or payment-specific. For example, if a bad actor is flagged in one payment system (i.e.,
Zelle), that does not mean a financial institution will have that bad actor or the token (i.e., mobile
phone number or email) flagged when allowing a fraudulent wire transfer to be released.15 The
fragmentation described above prevents a clear and cohesive picture of the payment fraud
landscape, actors, and trends, and poses a barrier to forming effective strategies to combat fraud.
As a result, we urge the Agencies to collect and promote greater sharing of fraud information
among financial institutions and with regulators, beyond SARs. The Agencies, along with
Treasury and FinCEN, should facilitate a public-private partnership including the relevant
Federal and State financial regulators, consumer protection agencies, law enforcement, financial
institutions, trade associations, consumer and privacy advocates, and other stakeholders.16
B. The Agencies should urge FinCEN to update the SAR form to capture
information about accounts that receive fraudulent funds.
It is well recognized that the more information about the types of accounts that receive
fraudulent funds, the more effective the programs that banks and fraud professionals use to
prevent fraud can become. Machine learning models and algorithms screening for fraud and
tracking fraud benefit from robust information. Similarly, Agencies supervising banks to ensure
BSA compliance should know which institutions are allowing accounts of fraudsters to remain
open or to be opened in the first instance. This can only be achieved if the Agencies, other
regulators, and law enforcement have access to reports about the accounts receiving the
fraudulent funds.
As a result, the Agencies should urge FinCEN to update the SAR form to capture information
about the accounts used to receive ill-gotten funds. The current SAR form only accommodates
accounts related to the reporting institution.17 In fraud cases where the destination account of the
perpetrator is known, reporting institutions relegate the destination account to the narrative. This
makes identification and aggregation of fraudulent activity more difficult for law enforcement.
When a consumer’s financial institution files a SAR following an incident of payment fraud, if
the payment was sent through a system that identifies the recipient (such as a wire transfer, ACH,
or P2P system), the SAR should identify the recipient institution and account. Allowing accounts
not domiciled at the reporting institution to be reported and designated appropriately would assist
enabling financial institutions and fintech companies to share critical fraud intelligence via API across Plaid.
Members contribute by reporting instances of fraud and can use the network to detect if a specific identify has
already been associated with fraud.
15 Any private database of suspected fraud actors could be considered a “consumer reporting agency” (CRA) under
the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). Early Warning Services already acknowledges it is a CRA. See CFPB, List
of Consumer Reporting Companies, 2023, at 28 (2023), available at
https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_consumer-reporting-companies-list_2023.pdf. As such, these
databases would be subject to the file disclosure, accuracy, and dispute resolution rights under the FCRA.

FinCEN and law enforcement in identifying, aggregating, and prioritizing fraud investigations to
better protect consumers.
Since fraud schemes affect many victims at various reporting institutions, fraud often results in a
hub-and-spoke relationship with one account receiving funds from many different, unrelated
accounts. This typology is recognized in the FFIEC Exam Manual18 and should be supported at
FinCEN by enhancing the SAR reporting process to include the fraud perpetrator’s account at the
receiving institution.
As discussed below, we also urge the Agencies to clarify that the filing of a SAR does not
automatically prevent the financial institution from sharing information (other than the SAR
filing) about the suspicious activity when necessary to help a customer resolve an improperly
frozen or closed account.
III. The Agencies must provide additional clarity and specificity to ensure that financial
institutions do not define risk too broadly in ways that impact financial inclusion.
A. Financial institutions should not consider credit risk as a factor in developing an
AML/CFT program.
FinCEN is seeking a “risk-based” approach to modernizing the AML regime to ensure “that
financial institutions direct more attention and resources toward higher-risk customers and
activities, consistent with the risk profile of the financial institution, rather than toward lower-
risk customers and activities.”19 But it is unclear how financial institutions would and should
identify what customers are considered higher risk and whether that risk analysis would be based
solely on factors that may reveal that a person or entity is engaging in potentially illicit activities
or whether credit risk would also factor into its risk analysis.20
It is a widely held belief that participation in the U.S. financial system often begins with access
to a bank account. However, financial institutions have broad discretion in setting risk tolerances
for whom they choose to allow as customers. This broad discretion often translates into policies
that negatively impact the very consumers who are seeking entrance into the financial system.
As such, we recommend that the statement of purpose defining the goals of an effective, risk-
based, and reasonably designed AML/CFT program include the following language:
“The purpose of an AML/CFT program requirement is to ensure that a financial
institution implements an effective, risk-based, and reasonably designed AML/CFT
program to identify, manage, and mitigate illicit finance activity risks that: complies with
the BSA and the requirements and prohibitions of FinCEN’s implementing regulations;
focuses attention and resources in a manner consistent with the risk profile of the
financial institution; may include consideration and evaluation of innovative approaches

from criminal abuse; and safeguards the national security of the United States, including
by preventing the flow of illicit funds in the financial system without creating
unnecessary barriers for American consumers, especially those from underserved
communities, to gain access to the U.S. financial services marketplace.”
As discussed in further detail below, consumers are often unsure why they are denied credit or
access to a bank account and whether the denial is related to a financial institution’s risk of
violating the BSA or because of a risk of financial loss related to underwriting or monetary loss.
FinCEN states that the proposed rule is “consistent with the BSA’s requirement for the Secretary
to consider the extension of financial services to the underbanked and facilitating financial
transactions while preventing criminal persons from abusing formal or informal financial
services networks.”21 But we believe more clarity and guidance need to be included in the
proposed rule as well as in any implementing guidance and examination manuals to explain that
credit risk is not the type of risk a financial institution should consider in developing and
implementing its AML/CFT program and to comply with the BSA.
B. Blunt-fisted, opaque identification requirements exclude vulnerable consumers
from the U.S. banking system and allow for discrimination.
1. Introduction
Financial institutions do not generally publicize which forms of identification they will accept
from consumers when reviewing an application for a demand deposit account. This uncertainty
means underserved consumers have no sense of whether they will be successful in opening an
account.
Additionally, consumers are not often told why the financial institution denied a request to open
a demand deposit account.22 This generates an impression among consumers that they are not
allowed to engage in our banking system because of some intrinsic quality around their situation
when it could ultimately be caused by the use of discretion among individual branch employees,
a consumer report such as ChexSystems, or a regional or national bank policy. Regardless of the
reason, being denied access to financial services can be embarrassing, especially when the denial
occurs in person. One negative interaction with our financial system can influence the way a
consumer will interact with the system for years to come. The industry’s opacity is unjustified
given the stakes.
The excuse most often cited by financial institutions for this lack of transparency— and their
unwillingness to accept certain alternative forms of ID for underserved consumers— is that they
21 See FinCEN’s proposed rule 89 FR 55428 (July 3, 2024) at 55432, referencing FN 39.
22 Because a demand deposit account does not meet the definition of credit under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act,
no adverse notice is required to be provided to the applicant/consumer. However, if a financial institution relied on a
consumer report from ChexSystems, for example, it should provide the consumer with an adverse action notice
under the Fair Credit Reporting Act.

must comply with the BSA. Among other requirements imposed by the BSA, financial
institutions must implement a Customer Identification Program (CIP) to verify the identity of an
applicant.
However, federal regulations implementing the BSA permit banks to use a wide range of
identification methods to open accounts for their customers and to implement their CIP. At its
core, the CIP must explain the bank’s procedures for opening an account, including stating what
identifying information will be obtained from each customer and how the bank will verify their
customers’ identities through both documentary and non-documentary methods.23
A financial institution has broad discretion in what policies it adopts in its CIP. The only
requirements BSA regulations impose are that a financial institution must obtain, at a minimum,
the following information from a customer prior to opening an account:
(1) Name;
(2) Date of birth, for an individual;
(3) Address; and
(4) an Identification number, which must be a taxpayer identification number for “U.S.
persons” or one or more of several options for non-U.S. persons, including an Individual
Tax Identification Number issued by the IRS, a passport number and country of issuance,
an alien identification card number, or number and country of issuance of any other
government-issued document evidencing nationality or residence and bearing a
photograph or similar safeguard.24
In addition, financial institutions must employ “risk-based procedures” for verifying the identity
of each customer to the extent “reasonable and practicable,” and within a reasonable time after
the account is opened.25 These procedures must enable the financial institution to form a
reasonable belief that it knows the true identity of each customer, and the procedures must be
“based on the bank’s assessment of the relevant risks, including those presented by the various
types of accounts maintained by the bank, the various methods of opening accounts provided by
the bank, the various types of identifying information available, and the bank’s size, location,
and customer base.”26
It is the requirement to utilize “risk-based” procedures consistent with the bank’s level of risk
tolerance that gives banks broad discretion in choosing who they bank. The “risk-based”
procedures are often utilized as a shield for obfuscating account-opening policies. Without
transparency into these policies, banks may ultimately engage in discriminatory practices,
utilizing overly simplistic policies that exclude immigrants, domestic violence survivors, justice-
involved people, and unhoused individuals who may lack access to various forms of
government-issued identification or longstanding addresses.27

More clarity is needed in the guidance the Agencies and FinCEN provide to financial
institutions. For example, local advocates in New York City, along with the New York Bankers
Association, wrote to the federal financial regulators in 2015, asking if the then-emerging
municipal ID for the City of New York would meet the minimum standards for verifying identity
at account opening.28 The regulators’ response did clarify that accepting the city’s ID would not
contradict the minimum standards in the regulations. But the regulators left the ultimate decision
of whether to accept the municipal ID up to individual banks, writing that each institution “may
determine that more information than the ID Card is necessary”29 to satisfy their duties under this
regulatory regime. Since 2015, other cities have implemented their own municipal ID programs,
yet banks still have no uniform practice of publicly disclosing which municipal ID programs
meet the requirements for their internal protocols, leaving consumers in the dark.
2. Recommendations
In general, the Agencies should consider implementing more detailed guidelines on how banks
should exercise their discretion to ensure that they meet the obligations of the Bank Secrecy Act
while also not excluding consumers from our banking system. These guidelines should:
• Emphasize the importance of transparency in account opening requirements, particularly
for underserved consumers who may experience barriers to obtaining traditional forms of
ID.
• Provide guidance for local governments on developing municipal ID programs.
• Explicitly name forms of ID that may be used as primary and secondary ID for
individuals unlikely to have access to state-issued ID.
Similarly, regulators should specify that there is likely a corresponding risk of unfair, deceptive,
or abusive practices associated with discriminating against consumers based on race or national
origin and that a denial of a bank account that relies, at least in part, on information obtained
within a consumer report triggers adverse action notice requirements under the Fair Credit
Reporting Act.30
We also recommend that the Agencies, in collaboration with FinCEN, take specific actions to
ensure the financial inclusion of underserved consumers in our consumer financial markets
without compromising the purpose of the BSA. To this end, the Agencies should guarantee that
overly broad and discriminatory bank policies do not bar access to bank accounts and affordable
credit by:
• Reviewing bank customer identification protocols, investigating the reasons behind
denials at the deposit account opening stage, and making their findings public whenever
possible. Specifically, the Agencies should:

o Ensure that financial institutions can justify that the policies implemented to
comply with a risk-based and reasonably designed AML/CFT program are
reasonably tailored, evidence-based, and implemented in a manner that is likely to
actually reduce risk.
o Determine whether and how background check reports, other screening or
monitoring reports, and algorithms are used to (1) assess and manage credit risk,
(2) assess and manage risk of fraud, (3) decide whether to give a prospective
customer an account, and (4) determine whether to close an existing customer’s
account.31
• Clarifying the distinction between unauthorized immigrants living in the United States
and non-U.S. persons living abroad in the FFIEC BSA AML/CFT examination manual,
with the latter posing a higher AML risk.
• Warning regulated entities that BSA AML/CFT compliance is not a justification for
unlawful discrimination.
• Promulgating guidance clarifying the extent to which municipal IDs and prison IDs may
meet the minimum identification requirements set out under the implementing regulations
under the BSA and provide guidelines or standards for local governments and
correctional facilities to follow when developing their ID programs.
• Encouraging and supporting correctional facilities in helping people obtain official photo
identification prior to leaving incarceration.
• Clarifying and encouraging banks and lenders to permit applicants to provide non-
traditional addresses, such as addresses of temporary group residences, homeless shelters,
domestic violence shelters, and correctional facilities.
• Clarifying that financial institutions may not maintain blanket policies and practices that
bar people with any kind of criminal record from having an account. There must be
reliable evidence that the specific policy or practice actually assists in preventing fraud
and complying with other legal obligations.
• Eliminating unnecessary barriers to account opening, such as requiring in-person
applicants to have their paper Social Security card, which many consumers have lost or
never had as it was in the possession of a parent.
C. Overly aggressive BSA/AML programs targeting fraud lead to bank account
closures and freezes.
1. Introduction
Recently, many consumers have raised concerns about bank account closures and/or freezes that
seem to occur without any sudden change of behavior by the consumer. Consumers report
frustration and uncertainty tied to account closures and freezes— primarily the lack of
information as to why the closure or freeze occurred and the inability to access funds in a timely
manner.
31 As noted above, any private database of suspected fraud actors could be considered a “consumer reporting
agency” (CRA) under the FCRA.
9
The number of consumers who have complained about checking and savings account closures to
the CFPB more than tripled since 2017.32 In 2022, the CFPB ordered Wells Fargo to pay $160
million to over one million people for improperly freezing or closing bank accounts from 2011 to
2016 when it “believed that a fraudulent deposit had been made into a consumer deposit account
based largely on an automated fraud detection system.”33
There have been other stories featured by reporters detailing the devastating impact sudden
account closures and freezes can have on consumers, especially when they are deprived of access
to their funds, are not provided any information about the reason for the institution’s actions, and
are not provided an opportunity to address any perceived risk.
Following are a few examples from a New York Times article detailing the responses consumers
received after discovering their accounts were either frozen or closed and their attempts to
communicate with their financial institutions about it:34
• Naafeh Dhillon, 28 from Brooklyn, NY, learned his account had been closed after his
debit card and credit card were declined. He was later told by a Chase representative that
the “bank’s global security and investigation team had ultimately made the decision.
Would the representative transfer him to that department? Nope… Since he wasn’t given
a specific reason for the closure, he couldn’t disprove whatever raised suspicions in the
first place.”
• Todd Zolecki, 47 of Media, PA, did not have his account closed, but his bank did lock
him out of access to his account. “They said your account has been suspended for further
review,” Why? “We can’t tell you that. The only thing we can tell you is it can take up to
60 days for this review.”
One of the reasons for the increase in account closures and freezes has to do with the increased
adoption of tools utilized by financial institutions to combat payment fraud and detect suspicious
activity, including the adoption of AI and machine learning technologies. Fraud vigilance is
critical, and new technologies can play an important role. However, these tools may harm
innocent consumers if not utilized properly and if institutions do not have clear procedures and
timelines in place to restore access to funds that are improperly frozen.
Financial institutions have an obligation under the BSA and accompanying AML regulations to
ensure that they maintain and follow internal ongoing customer due diligence (CDD) policies.

The CDD policies must allow the institution to understand “the nature and purpose of customer
relationships for the purpose of developing a customer risk profile” and require the institution to
“[c]onduct[] ongoing monitoring to identify and report suspicious transactions and, on a risk
basis, to maintain and update customer information.”35
Because of the CDD obligation and the ongoing problem of payment fraud, sometimes the
appropriate response by an institution that suspects its customer is engaging in fraudulent or
other illicit activity is to freeze a transaction or close an account that is being used to receive
fraudulent funds before the funds are gone and more consumers can be defrauded. But
sometimes banks get it wrong or suspicions turn out to be unfounded, especially when automated
tools are used.
According to the Bank Policy Institute, “a sample of the largest banks reviewed approximately
16 million alerts, filed over 640,000 SARs, and received feedback from law enforcement on a
median of 4% of those SARs. Ultimately, this means that 90-95% of the individuals that banks
report on were likely innocent.”36 As these numbers demonstrate, even activity that leads to the
filing of a SAR may ultimately not warrant an account freeze or closure. And if a financial
institution is utilizing the review of SARs as part of its risk assessment process,37 then a financial
institution needs to consider which of the many SARs it may have filed truly posed a risk to the
financial institution and which SARs were more precautionary but not ultimately tied to true risk.
The impact of sudden account closures in response to potential fraud on innocent consumers
cannot be overstated. Often, the most vulnerable people have been denied access to their money,
rendering them unable to eat or pay rent. Some impact on innocent individuals may be
impossible to avoid, as banks may need to act quickly on imperfect information. But that is why
it is imperative to have procedures in place to enable people to dispute account freezes and
closures and get their money back as soon as possible.
For example, after Chime embarked on a marketing campaign to convince people to open Chime
accounts to receive their stimulus payments, its inadequate identity verification led to a wave of
fraud. Chime then froze numerous accounts. But instead of enabling people to quickly prove
their identities, some people were left without their money for months on end.38
Similarly, Bank of America froze 350,000 unemployment debit cards in California after
extensive fraud reports. But the freezes caught many legitimately unemployed workers, and the
bank failed to respond in a timely fashion to their complaints.39 Months later, after a lawsuit was

filed, a judge prohibited the bank from freezing accounts for California unemployment benefits
based solely on an automated fraud filter and required it to do a better job of responding when
jobless people said their benefits were stolen.40 The CFPB also brought enforcement actions
against Bank of America41 and U.S. Bank42 for similar conduct in indiscriminately freezing
accounts and leaving them frozen for long periods of time. This conduct harmed the most
vulnerable consumers – those who had lost their jobs and were relying on unemployment
benefits.
Sudden account closures are also common among several communities that we feature in these
comments. For instance, immigrants without immigration status and immigrants from specific
countries, such as Iran, have reported having their bank accounts closed suddenly after being
asked to provide proof of legal residency in the country.43
If people cannot access the money they need based on red flags triggered by automated fraud
tracking systems, then they need a timely solution, not another obstacle. Yet that is what occurs;
consumers face obstacles upon obstacles. When a consumer complains about an account closure
or freeze, the complaint is often not followed by a reasonable investigation by the financial
institution that includes a discussion with the consumer or that provides any clear timeline to
unfreeze their money. Additionally, when the consumers facing these issues have other
vulnerabilities discussed later in these comments—such as immigration status or involvement
with our justice system—it can have an effect on the ways that entire families and communities
interact with our system.
2. Recommendations
As discussed in the previous section, crude BSA/AML compliance policies can shut consumers
out of our banking system. The Agencies, along with other regulators, should investigate the
reasons that deposit accounts are closed or frozen and develop a strategy to minimize the number
of account closures for innocent consumers.

12
The Agencies and FinCEN should also provide guidance to financial institutions about what
information they may and should provide to accountholders regarding freezes and account
closures while still complying with the BSA and the proposed AML/CFT program requirements.
For example, they could clarify in an FAQ that, while financial institutions are not allowed to
disclose that a SAR was filed, they are allowed to disclose that an account was frozen or closed
due to irregular or flagged activity and/or describe the specific activities that raised concerns,
allowing the consumer to respond.
The Agencies and FinCEN should also clarify that if a SAR does not lead to criminal prosecution
or involvement by law enforcement for suspected money laundering/financing of terrorism
activity, then a financial institution should not automatically take derisking measures and close
the account based solely on the filing of a SAR, but the institution should instead take a
measured, case-by-case, risk-based approach.
Finally, the Agencies, FinCEN, and the CFPB should provide guidance to financial institutions
about the importance of having clear procedures to enable consumers to quickly regain access to
their funds when they are frozen due to concerns of suspicious activity, provide guidance as to
the timeliness of returning an accountholder’s funds after account closure, and specify that
failing to have clear procedures and provide timely return of any funds may constitute an unfair,
deceptive, or abusive business practice.
IV. The Agencies should protect specific vulnerable populations that experience
financial exclusion often exacerbated by overly broad BSA/AML programs.
The following sections highlight factors that render specific vulnerable groups of consumers
susceptible to exclusion from our financial system and limitations that may result in barriers to
participating in our mainstream system.44
A. Barriers experienced by immigrants
The United States has more immigrants than any other country in the world, with roughly
fourteen percent of the U.S. population having been born in another country, totaling 47 million
people.45 The foreign-born experience in the United States varies widely depending on the
circumstances that led to their migration— whether they have permanent, temporary, or no status
to remain in the country and whether they are proficient in English. Despite their diversity,
immigrants from all walks of life often face similar obstacles to fully participating in our
financial system.
1. Immigration status as a barrier to banking services
44 The following sections address Question 29 of FinCEN’s proposed rule, 89 FR 55428 (July 3, 2024) at 55448. For
a more in-depth discussion of the financial barriers encountered by the communities highlighted in these comments
and additional recommendations, see NCLC’s Comments to Treasury’s Request for Information on Financial
Inclusion available at https://www.nclc.org/resources/comments-on-treasury-departments-request-for-information-
on-financial-inclusion/.
45 Krogstad, Jens Manuel and Passel, Jeffrey, “What we know about unauthorized immigrants living in the U.S.,”
Pew Research Ctr. (Nov. 16, 2023), available at https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/11/16/what-we-
know-about-unauthorized-immigrants-living-in-the-us/.
13
Of the foreign-born population in the U.S., 10.5 million people are considered “unauthorized,”
which the Department of Homeland Security defines as “all foreign-born non-citizens who are
not legal residents.”46 Not all of these individuals are subject to a heightened risk of immediate
removal— many have been awarded temporary protection from removal through programs such
as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), Temporary Protected Status (TPS), or
pending asylum cases.47 Individuals who are unauthorized without asylum cases pending or any
temporary relief from removal are often among our society’s most vulnerable. In addition to
facing a near-constant fear of removal, these individuals often experience exploitation and wage
theft from their employers48 and are more likely to live in poverty.49
First, immigrants experience barriers in obtaining banking services because of a lack of an
identification number – which can even impact those not subject to immediate removal. When an
individual first moves to the United States, they are unlikely to already have a U.S. government-
issued identification number, such as a social security number or an individual tax identification
number (ITIN), which is a prerequisite to opening a bank or credit account in the United States.50
Given current backlogs in our immigration system, it can take weeks for an immigrant or asylum
seeker eligible for a SSN to get their Social Security cards from the Social Security
Administration. However, it can take even longer for consumers ineligible for an SSN to receive
an ITIN from the Internal Revenue Service, which requires that a W-7 form for a new ITIN be
submitted along with a completed U.S. federal income tax return.51 The IRS also has strict
identification requirements to qualify for an ITIN, and requires that applicants either mail their
original identification documents (or certified copies of documents from the issuing agency)
along with their application or apply for an ITIN in person using an IRS-authorized Certifying
Acceptance Agent (CAA).52 These delays often result in new arrivals and immigrants without
status lacking one of the most fundamental prerequisites to opening bank accounts and building
credit in our country.

14
Second, immigrants without status experience barriers to opening bank accounts and building
credit, even if they can obtain an ITIN from the IRS, because the system attributes higher risks to
noncitizens. In the banking context, immigrants without status are often treated as “non-U.S.
persons,” which the federal financial regulators list as a “risk factor” associated with money
laundering and terrorism financing in the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council
(FFIEC) BSA/AML examination manual.53 This manual also specifically instructs institutions to
consider the forms of identification and the account holder’s home country as “risk factors”
when determining the risk profile for a “nonresident alien” account.54 However, this manual does
not provide any guidance on the relative risk profiles of nonresidents currently residing in the
U.S. without status and with no intent to leave, making no distinction between these individuals
and those persons not residing within the U.S. This policy rewards overly aggressive bank
policies that exclude immigrants without status, without addressing any corresponding
compliance risks associated with discrimination, and may be partly to blame for some of the
unnecessary account closures and freezes described above.
Finally, immigrants without status experience barriers to opening a bank account because of
problems associated with obtaining a government-issued photo ID. Only sixteen states allow
undocumented persons to obtain driver’s licenses.55 These limitations have led to some
municipalities offering their own IDs, yet, as discussed above, many financial institutions will
only accept municipal IDs as a secondary form of identification in opening a deposit account.56
2. Recommendations to address the impacts of overly broad BSA/AML
programs on immigrants
The Agencies, in collaboration with FinCEN, should take action to advance the financial
inclusion of immigrants and ensure overly broad and discriminatory bank policies do not bar
access to bank accounts and affordable credit by:
• Reviewing bank customer identification protocols, investigating the reasons behind
denials at the deposit account opening stage, and making their findings public whenever
possible.
• Promulgating guidance clarifying the extent to which municipal IDs may meet the
minimum identification requirements set out under the implementing regulations under
the BSA and provide guidelines or standards for local governments to follow when
developing their municipal ID programs.
• Clarifying the distinction between unauthorized immigrants living in the United States
and non-U.S. persons living abroad in the FFIEC BSA/AML examination manual and

B. Barriers experienced by survivors of domestic violence
1. Economic abuse and the financial impact of domestic violence
Survivors of domestic violence experience unique barriers to participating in our financial
system. Safety comes at a cost. Abusers intentionally isolate survivors, reducing their social
network of friends, family, and social systems and access to resources. As a result, a survivor
must often choose between returning to an abusive partner for money or incurring debt to access
safety. A study on the economic well-being of survivors revealed that 74% of survivors reported
having to use a credit card to pay for things their family needed because they did not have
enough money.57 The same economic well-being study found that 74% of survivors borrowed
money from a payday lender or car title lender to pay for things their family needed.
In addition to experiencing various types of physical, psychological, and emotional abuse and the
financial cost of leaving an abusive relationship, survivors of domestic violence are negatively
impacted by the economic abuse they experience. Economic abuse can include acts that deprive
a survivor of access to their own financial assets and accounts; acts that prevent a survivor from
being able to meet existing financial obligations (like paying bills or going to work or school);
and acts that cause a survivor to incur debt. Economic abuse is a tactic often employed by
abusers to prevent survivors from leaving an abusive relationship. In fact, 99% of survivors of
domestic violence experience economic abuse, and financial concerns are the most cited reasons
why a survivor cannot leave an abusive relationship.58
Economic abuse has lifelong, lasting effects on survivors. The gravity of its impacts has received
federal recognition warranting codification of the term economic abuse in the Violence Against
Women Act Reauthorization of 2022. Economic abuse, in the context of domestic violence,
dating violence, and abuse in later life, means behavior that is coercive, deceptive, or
unreasonably controls or restrains a person’s ability to acquire, use, or maintain economic
resources to which they are entitled, including using coercion, fraud, or manipulation to:
• Restrict a person’s access to money, assets, credit, or financial information;
• Unfairly use a person’s personal economic resources, including money, assets, and credit,
for one’s own advantage; or
• Exert undue influence over a person’s financial and economic behavior or decisions,
including forcing default on joint or other financial obligations, exploiting powers of
attorney, guardianship, or conservatorship, or failing or neglecting to act in the best
interests of a person to whom one has a fiduciary duty.59

59 34 U.S.C.A. § 12291(a)(13).
16
This pervasive and sweeping form of abuse and dominance presents itself in many ways,
including preventing a survivor from accessing bank accounts and financial resources, spending
down previously held assets, and employment sabotage, all of which create economic
dependence on the abusive partner.
Economic abuse occurs in an environment of coercive control, which is a dense net of behaviors
a person puts into place to control another. Coercive control can include isolating the survivor
from friends and family, establishing rules for the survivor’s behavior, and limiting the
survivor’s access to transportation, education, and employment. These behaviors do not stand
alone – they exist within an environment of intimidation, a history of past violence, and the
threat of future violence or other harm if the survivor does not comply. Economic abuse is not
limited to a discrete incident; rather, economic abuse consists of a series of acts that compound
and result in an “economic ripple effect” that creates economic barriers to safety across a
survivor’s lifetime.60
When a survivor has been subjected to economic abuse, it is far more likely that they will have
damaged credit, reduced income, and a potentially negative rental history. As a result, survivors
of economic abuse are highly likely to experience credit, housing, and employment denials or
obtain less favorable credit, housing, and employment options.
2. Barriers faced by survivors at account opening
The intimate nature of domestic violence means that abusive partners often have access to a
survivor’s personal identifying information (PII), such as a Social Security number, date of birth,
employer, income data, and address history, all of which allow an abuser to obtain credit and
open accounts without the survivor’s knowledge or consent. The National Domestic Violence
Hotline, a non-profit serving the needs of domestic violence victims, shared that 22% of female
callers reported that their partners created debt in their name via a fraudulent transaction.
When an abusive partner opens an account in the survivor’s name, the abuser can create a
fraudulent credit profile with an address, phone number, email, employment history, or income
data that do not actually belong to the survivor. Furthermore, the abuser can set up PINs,
passwords, security questions, and responses to the fraudulent account that ensure complete and
sole control and access to the account. Though a survivor may have various legal remedies
available in this context, they often cannot access the fraudulent account as they are unable to
provide correct security information.
Without access to the account, a survivor is unable to stop the abusive partner from continuing to
accrue debt in their name and is unable to close the account completely. One advocate recalls
the hours she spent on the phone with a survivor trying to dispute a fraudulent credit card
account with Citibank. The survivor did not know the password to the account her abuser created
to access the account online, and she did not know the PIN her abuser created, all of which
prevented her from being able to speak to a representative on the phone. The survivor could not

Change,” Domestic Violence Report, available at https://csaj.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Economic-Ripple-

take any action on the account quickly but instead had to send a dispute letter to the billing error
address, which she could not have done without the help of a lawyer. This same survivor only
learned of the Citibank account, as well as various other fraudulent credit accounts totaling
$60,000, when in the middle of a divorce proceeding. It took the survivor over three years, and
the help of a lawyer, to finally remove all the information on her credit report linked to her
abusive spouse and the fraudulent accounts.
Even though the survivors are the victims of fraud, financial institutions may often hold the
survivor as complicit in the fraud and refuse to continue to extend credit or bank the survivor. As
a result, a survivor is unfairly categorized as a risk to the financial institution.
Furthermore, survivors of domestic violence often encounter additional difficulties with opening
a new account – whether it is a credit account or a bank account. Survivors may not have
sufficient documentation to prove their identity or residential address. It is common for survivors
to flee from their previous residence in a rush, without the various forms of identification
required to open their own bank accounts. On some occasions, abusive partners may also retain
the survivor’s identification as a method to continue to exert control over the survivor. Some
survivors separating from an abusive partner may need to live in transitional housing, such as a
domestic violence shelter, and thus lack a permanent address. By failing to address these
barriers, our banking and credit systems make it that much harder for domestic violence
survivors to separate from the abuser.
3. Recommendations to address the impacts of overly broad BSA/AML
programs on survivors
In addition to the many recommendations previously mentioned, we suggest specific actions to
enable domestic violence survivors to fully participate in our financial system.
The Agencies should encourage financial institutions to develop policies to assist survivors of
domestic violence at account opening. For example, the Agencies, FinCEN, and other regulators,
could:
• Issue guidance clarifying that financial institutions may accept non-traditional forms of
identification.
• Issue guidance clarifying and encouraging banks and lenders to permit applicants to
provide non-traditional addresses, such as addresses of temporary group residences,
domestic violence shelters, and homeless shelters.61
C. Barriers experienced by justice-involved individuals
1. The financial impact of involvement with the justice system
61 Institutions could consider providing a six-month grace period in obtaining address verification if a domestic
violence survivor has provided a letter from a domestic violence shelter or transitional living center confirming that
the survivor has resided there or adopting a policy accepting the address of the shelter.
18
Justice-involved people are often locked out of the mainstream consumer financial marketplace
for various interconnected reasons. Being locked out of the mainstream can, in turn, prolong
justice involvement – for example, if a person recently released from prison cannot get credit to
buy or lease a car, they may not be able to meet their release requirements – with ripple effects
on families and communities.62
The population of justice-involved people in the United States is vast. As of March 2023, nearly
2 million people were incarcerated in this country, including over one million in state prisons,
over 500,000 in local jails, and over 200,000 in federal prisons and jails.63 One in three adults—
about 77 million people—has a criminal record.64 Nearly half of children in the United States
have at least one parent with a record.65
Black, Latino, and Native people are massively overrepresented in the criminal legal system. For
instance, Black Americans are twice as likely to be arrested as white Americans,66 and are more
likely to be stopped by the police, detained, charged with more serious crimes, and sentenced
more harshly than white American.67 As the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has stated, these racial and ethnic disparities are “well established and persistent”;
they “cannot be simply attributed to certain groups committing more crimes and are better
explained by biases” in the criminal legal system.68

People with disabilities and members of the LGBTQ+ community are also disproportionately
represented in the criminal legal system. According to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights,
""[i]ncarcerated people are twice as likely to have an intellectual disability, four to six times more
likely to have a cognitive disability, twice as likely to have a mobility disorder, three to four
times more likely to be blind or have a vision impairment, and two to three times more likely to
have a hearing impairment than the general population.”69 The incarceration rate of LGBTQ+
individuals is more than three times that of the U.S. adult population.70
Poverty is both a predictor and result of justice involvement.71 The median income among people
entering prison is 41 percent less than the national average,72 and people have virtually no ability
to earn meaningful wages while they are incarcerated.73 People leaving incarceration are even
worse off financially, including because they often lose out on careers-long earning potential
while they are incarcerated.74 People with any kind of criminal record also often struggle to find
gainful employment and housing because of bias and policies against justice-involved
individuals and issues stemming from inaccurate or misleading background checks.75 Barriers to
housing and employment often result in high rates of homelessness among the formerly
incarcerated.76
Justice-involved individuals also frequently accrue court debt in the form of fines, fees, and
restitution that are imposed in the criminal legal system, often without any assessment of their

those who aren’t, and people earning less than 150 percent of the federal poverty level are 15 times more likely to be

ability to pay.77 Because justice-involved people and their families are disproportionately poor,
many are not able to afford repayment and their debts become past due,78 perpetuating cycles of
extraction and poverty and prolonging justice involvement.
2. Limited access to banking and credit products
Upon leaving custody, justice-involved people struggle to access checking and savings accounts
due to various account opening requirements.79 First, banks typically require photo identification
to open a bank account, as discussed above. A person may have had their driver’s license
suspended because of outstanding criminal justice debt that they cannot afford to pay80 or had
their ID expire or get lost while incarcerated, meaning they cannot satisfy this requirement.
Second, people must demonstrate proof of address both to renew a license and to open a bank
account.81 Justice-involved people may struggle to meet this requirement if they are currently
incarcerated, living in a halfway house or other temporary group residence, or are unhoused.
Third, banks may deny justice-involved people accounts based on credit checks.82 For example,
banks generally request reports on potential customers from companies such as Early Warning
Systems and ChexSystems that include information on accounts closed by banks because of
unpaid fees or suspected fraud.83 People leaving incarceration may face these issues, including
because managing accounts while in prison or jail can be very difficult. People also report having
been victims of identity theft or “identity sharing” gone wrong while incarcerated.84
Fourth, some accounts come with conditions to maintain an account – opening deposits,
minimum balances, or monthly fees. Justice-involved individuals, including those who recently
left incarceration, likely have limited financial resources as described above, and will struggle to
meet these requirements.85
Justice-involved people also struggle to access mainstream consumer credit. Justice-involved
people are more likely than people without justice involvement to have “poor” or “very poor”

credit scores.86 Even when justice-involved people do manage to obtain credit, such as in the
form of a credit card, that may not be the end of the story. Some lenders conduct background
checks on applicants and on existing customers.87 These background checks may result in a
decrease in the availability of or an increase in the cost of consumer credit for people with
criminal records.88 They may also result in the closure of existing customers’ credit cards—
without explanation from the lender or information about the entity that conducted the
background check or what the background check includes.89 As the CFPB has flagged, given the
racial disparities in arrests and convictions, such practices may raise fair lending concerns.90
These practices may also violate the adverse action notice requirements of the FCRA and ECOA,
as well as the FCRA provision providing that a consumer reporting agency may not prohibit a
user of a report from disclosing the content of the report to the consumer if an adverse action has
been taken.91
3. Recommendations to address the impacts of overly broad BSA/AML
programs on justice-involved individuals
The Agencies, in collaboration with FinCEN and state correctional institutions, should take
action to ensure that justice-involved individuals are not hurt by overly broad BSA AML/CFT
programs by:
• Ensuring that overly broad, discriminatory criminal records policies do not bar access to
bank accounts and affordable credit. To do so, the Agencies should collaborate with the
CFPB and other relevant regulators:

 To investigate both bank account and credit account closures based on criminal
records and make their findings public whenever possible.
 The Agencies should determine whether and how background check
reports, other screening or monitoring reports, and algorithms are used to
(1) assess and manage credit risk, (2) assess and manage the risk of fraud,
(3) decide whether to give a prospective client an account, and (4)
determine whether to close an existing client’s account.
 Issue guidance clarifying that financial institutions may not maintain blanket
policies and practices that bar people with any kind of criminal record from
having an account. There must be reliable evidence that the specific policy or
practice actually assists in preventing fraud and complying with other legal
obligations.
• Collaborating with relevant partner agencies to issue guidance clarifying that financial
institutions may accept non-traditional forms of identification, such as prison IDs.
• Encouraging and supporting correctional facilities in helping people obtain official
picture identification before leaving incarceration.
• Issuing guidance clarifying and encouraging banks and lenders to permit applicants to
provide non-traditional addresses, such as addresses of temporary group residences,
homeless shelters, and correctional facilities.92
V. The Agencies should be extremely cautious and vigilant about the use of AI in
AML/CFT programs and BSA compliance.
In its proposed rule, FinCEN sought feedback regarding the use of innovative approaches and the
use of emerging technologies, such as machine learning or artificial intelligence.93 FinCEN also
stated in its proposed rule that although “one of the AML Act’s purposes is to ‘encourage
technological innovation and the adoption of new technology by financial institutions to more
effectively counter money laundering and the financing of terrorism,’”94 FinCEN “recognizes
that automated transaction monitoring systems have the potential to generate a significant
number of alerts that are not necessarily indicative of suspicious activity.”95
We agree that it is of great importance for all parties who engage in payments (financial
institutions, payment processors, card networks, money service businesses, and fintech
companies) to utilize tools to combat payment fraud, including AI and machine learning
technologies. However, without proper supervision and consumer protections in place, these
tools may harm innocent consumers.96
92 As discussed at Treasury’s Re-Entry Financial Resilience Discussion: Addressing Barriers in Financial Services
for Justice-Impacted Communities on January 12, 2024, some credit unions, such as Stepping Stones Federal Credit
Union already serve incarcerated people. Brock Fritz, ‘Everything we do is to better the community,’ Credit Union

96 For a more in depth discussion of our concerns regarding the use of AI, see NCLC’s Comments in response to the
U.S. Department of Treasury’s (Treasury) Request for Information on Uses, Opportunities, and Risks of Artificial
23
Furthermore, concerns about the use of AI and machine learning tools arise regarding the lack of
transparency and explainability of the more complicated models, the unrestrained surveillance
and collection of consumer data, and the potential for bias and discrimination. The speed and
power of this technology, and its wide-scale adoption with little regulatory oversight, puts
consumers at systemic risk of harm. AI and machine learning systems used for BSA compliance
and risk assessment have the capacity to make decisions about who obtains credit, housing,
banking, insurance, and financial services. These are high-risk systems that should receive the
highest level of regulatory scrutiny.
The Agencies, along with FinCEN, the Treasury, and other regulators, should develop a
regulatory framework that requires robust evaluation of AI and machine learning systems used
by financial institutions at every stage of development and deployment to determine whether AI
systems are safe and effective. The framework should pursue a rights-based approach that
protects consumers from harm and preserves their rights. This framework should look at the
potential harm to consumers rather than seeking only to mitigate the risk the AI or machine
learning technology poses to financial institutions. This approach is consistent with the White
House’s blueprint for the AI Bill of Rights and is the basis for a robust regulatory scheme that
protects consumers.97 An approach that prioritizes the risks to financial institutions can result in
an unacceptable infringement of civil rights, constitutional rights, privacy rights, and statutory
consumer protections.
VI. Conclusion
We recognize that developing a rule for anti-money laundering and countering the financing of
terrorism programs is an arduous undertaking that requires some flexibility. We also recognize
that a strong rule will help prevent and address fraud that impacts millions of consumers.
However, more clarity and guidance are needed to ensure that these efforts do not harm
consumers’ access to financial services—especially consumers belonging to certain vulnerable
populations— or give financial institutions the ability to use compliance with the BSA as a
shield or an excuse for denying access to these consumers. As a result, we urge the Agencies to
keep underserved populations top of mind when developing guidance, policies, and examination
requirements.
In summary, the Agencies should address fraud by:
• Promoting greater sharing of fraud information among financial institutions and with
regulators, beyond SARs.
• Urging FinCEN to enhance the SAR process to capture the identity of the account and
institution that receives fraudulent funds.
In addition, the Agencies should provide greater clarity and specificity to ensure that financial
institutions do not define risk too broadly by:

• Ensuring that financial institutions do not consider credit risk as a factor in developing an
AML/CFT program.
• Reviewing bank customer identification protocols, investigating the reasons behind
denials at the deposit account opening stage, and making their findings public whenever
possible. Specifically, the Agencies, FinCEN, and other relevant regulatory agencies
should:
o Ensure that financial institutions can justify that the policies implemented to
comply with a risk-based and reasonably designed AML/CFT program are
reasonably tailored, evidence-based, and implemented in a manner that is likely to
actually reduce risk.
o Determine whether and how background check reports, other screening or
monitoring reports, and algorithms are used to (1) assess and manage credit risk,
(2) assess and manage risk of fraud, (3) decide whether to give a prospective
customer an account, and (4) determine whether to close an existing customer’s
account.
• Clarifying the distinction between unauthorized immigrants living in the United States
and non-U.S. persons living abroad in the FFIEC BSA AML/CFT examination manual
and warning regulated entities that BSA AML/CFT compliance is not a justification for
unlawful discrimination.
• Promulgating guidance clarifying the extent to which municipal IDs and prison IDs may
meet the minimum identification requirements set out by the BSA regulations and
provide guidelines or standards for local governments and correctional facilities to follow
when developing their ID programs.
• Encouraging and supporting correctional facilities in helping people obtain official photo
identification prior to leaving incarceration.
• Clarifying and encouraging banks and lenders to permit applicants to provide non-
traditional addresses, such as addresses of temporary group residences, homeless shelters,
domestic violence shelters, and correctional facilities.
• Clarifying that financial institutions may not maintain blanket policies and practices that
bar people with any kind of criminal record from having an account. There must be
reliable evidence that the specific policy or practice actually assists in preventing fraud
and complying with other legal obligations.
• Ensuring that overly aggressive BSA/AML programs targeting fraud do not lead to bank
account closures and freezes. Specifically, the Agencies, FinCEN, and the CFPB and
should:
o investigate the reasons that deposit accounts are closed or frozen and develop a
strategy to minimize the number of account closures for innocent consumers;
o provide guidance to financial institutions about what information they may and
should provide to accountholders regarding freezes and account closures while
still complying with the BSA and the proposed AML/CFT program requirements.
o clarify that if a SAR does not lead to criminal prosecution or involvement by law
enforcement for suspected money laundering/financing of terrorism activity, then
a financial institution should not automatically take derisking measures and close
the account based solely on the filing of a SAR but should instead take a
measured, case-by-case, risk-based approach.
25
o provide guidance to financial institutions about the importance of having clear
procedures to enable consumers to quickly regain access to their funds when they
are frozen due to concerns of suspicious activity; the timeliness of returning an
accountholder’s funds after account closure; and specify that failing to have clear
procedures and timely return of any funds may constitute an unfair, deceptive, or
abusive business practice.
In collaboration with FinCEN, the Agencies should also protect specific vulnerable populations
that experience financial exclusion often exacerbated by overly broad BSA/AML programs. The
Agencies, FinCEN, and other regulators should:
• Take action to ensure the financial inclusion of immigrants by:
o Reviewing bank customer identification protocols, investigating the reasons
behind denials at the deposit account opening stage, and making their findings
public whenever possible.
o Promulgating guidance clarifying the extent to which municipal IDs may meet
the minimum identification requirements set out under the BSA regulations,
and provide guidelines or standards for local governments to follow when
developing their municipal ID programs.
o Clarifying the distinction between unauthorized immigrants living in the
United States and non-U.S. persons living abroad in the FFIEC BSA/AML
examination manual and warn regulated entities that BSA AML/CFT
compliance is not a justification for unlawful discrimination.
• Take action to assist survivors of domestic violence at account opening by issuing
guidance:
o Clarifying that financial institutions may accept non-traditional forms of
identification.
o Clarifying and encouraging banks and lenders to permit applicants to provide
non-traditional addresses, such as addresses of temporary group residences,
domestic violence shelters, and homeless shelters.
• Take action to ensure that justice-involved individuals are not hurt by overly broad BSA
AML/CFT programs by:
 Investigating both bank account and credit account closures based on criminal
records and making the findings public whenever possible.
 Issuing guidance clarifying that financial institutions may not maintain blanket
policies and practices that bar people with any kind of criminal record from
having an account.
 Issuing guidance clarifying that financial institutions may accept non-traditional
forms of identification, such as prison IDs.
 Encouraging and supporting correctional facilities in helping people obtain
official photo identification before leaving incarceration.
 Issuing guidance clarifying and encouraging banks and lenders to permit
applicants to provide non-traditional addresses, such as addresses of temporary
group residences, homeless shelters, and correctional facilities.
Finally, the Agencies should be extremely cautious and vigilant about the use of AI in AML/CFT
programs and BSA compliance. The Agencies, FinCEN, Treasury, and other regulators should:
26
• Develop a regulatory framework that requires robust evaluation of AI and machine
learning systems used by financial institutions at every stage of development and
deployment to determine whether AI systems are safe and effective. The framework
should look at the potential harm to consumers rather than seeking only to mitigate the
risk the AI or machine learning technology poses to financial institutions.
We appreciate the Agencies’ willingness to undertake this effort and are happy to answer
questions. If you have any questions, please contact Carla Sanchez-Adams at

Ladies and Gentlemen:
The Illinois Bankers Association (the “IBA”) appreciates this opportunity to comment on the
proposed interagency regulations implementing Sections 114 and 315 of the Fair and Accurate Credit
Transactions Act of 2003 as proposed by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of Thrift
Supervision, the National Credit Union Administration, and the Federal Trade Commission. The IBA is a
full-service trade association representing state and national banks, savings banks, and savings and loan
associations of all sizes in the State of Illinois; collectively the IBA represents over 85% of all banking
assets in our state.
OVERVIEW OF OUR CONCERNS
The IBA views the 31 “red flags” that have been proposed to aid in preventing, detecting, and
mitigating identity theft to be excessive and overly burdensome. The enormous costs that the financial
industry will incur in its compliance with the regulations far exceed the potential benefits to consumers.
For example, “red flag” Number 19 in Appendix J requires the tracking of activity on an account that is
inconsistent with established behavioral patterns, such as a “material increase” in the use of available
credit. Smaller community banks that have limited resources (for both systems and personnel) would, at
the very least, be required to purchase expensive new software from third party vendors in order to meet
this requirement, followed by added costs for integration, training, monitoring and reporting, ultimately
resulting, we predict, in a preponderance of “false positives” produced every month due to legitimate
account usage.
In addition, we are concerned that the overly-extensive “red flags” will encourage a false sense of
security in consumers by suggesting that financial institutions are principally responsible for tracking and
reporting events that are suggestive of identity theft. The consumer—who has full knowledge and control
over his or her own financial transactions—is the first line of defense against identity theft. Consumers
are in the best position to monitor their accounts and to identify unusual and potentially fraudulent activity.
Yet the sheer number of standards that are being proposed for financial institutions—and the proposed
“red flags” clearly are the functional equivalent of standards—inevitably will prompt consumers to expect
their financial institutions to serve as the principle guardian against identity theft. We are concerned that
financial institutions eventually may find themselves in costly litigation with customers over varying
interpretations of their responsibilities under the proposed rules.
We also are concerned with the proposed migration of the role of the financial institution’s board
of directors from one of oversight to one of transaction monitoring. Board members are selected for their
diverse business expertise. We submit that it would not be the wisest use of their time to be deluged with
reports of “red flag” incidents before, during or after each board meeting. Management should bear the
responsibility for ensuring the implementation of these rules, not the board.
COMMENTS ON § 334.82 - DUTIES OF USERS REGARDING ADDRESS DISCREPENCIES
This section of the proposed regulations requires a user of consumer reports to verify a
consumer’s identity in certain cases after it has received a “notice of address discrepancy” from a
consumer-reporting agency. Following verification of the consumer’s identity, a user would then need to
report a “confirmed address” to the consumer reporting agency.
This requirement for identity verification and address confirmation should be risk-based. That is,
if the address discrepancy reported by the consumer reporting agency appears to be insignificant in
nature, such as the use of “avenue” instead of “street” in an address, verification of the consumer’s
identity and address confirmation should not be required.
In addition, the proposal does not give examples of what constitutes a “substantial difference”
between addresses that would trigger the verification and addresses for the reporting requirement.
Additionally, the terms “new relationship” and “reporting period” should be defined in the regulations.
COMMENTS ON § 334.90 - DUTIES REGARDING THE DETECTION, PREVENTION AND MITIGATION
OF IDENTITY THEFT
This section of the proposed regulations requires the implementation of a written Identity Theft
Prevention Program for the detection of “red flags” and the mitigation of the risk they present. Appendix J
lists the proposed “red flags.”
Appendix J, Number 12, would require a financial institution to treat a customer’s use of an
address, Social Security number, or home or cell phone number previously submitted by another
customer as a ”red flag.” In most cases, there are valid reasons for the duplicate use of an address and
telephone number, such as when different customers reside at the same address and share the same
telephone number. Tracking the duplicative use of this information across different business lines would
involve an enormous expense with limited benefits to consumers.
Appendix J, Number 15, is inconsistent with the existing Customer Identification Program (“CIP”)
rules set forth in 31 CFR §103.121. There currently is no requirement under the CIP rules for financial
institutions to verify identity by “go[ing] beyond that which generally would be available from a wallet or a
consumer report” as stated in the proposed regulations.
“Red flag” Number 17 in Appendix J suggests that there is a cause for concern when a
customer’s mail is returned as undeliverable although transactions continue to be conducted in
connection with the customer’s account. Customers often forget to report a change of address or delay in
reporting an address change. Consideration should be given to these failures and delays, so that only
repeated instances of returned mail over a considerable period of time should be deemed to be a “red
flag.”
CONCLUSION
Although the IBA recognizes the important role that financial institutions play in the fight against
identity theft, we do not support the proposed rules to the extent and for the reasons stated above. In
addition, given the enormous amount of system enhancements, policy development and employee
education required to implement the proposals, we recommend that, at a minimum, the mandatory
effective date be delayed for up to 18 months following promulgation of the final regulations.
We appreciate your consideration of our comments.
Sincerely,
W. Alison Huszar

Offsite Detection of Insider Abuse and Bank Fraud Among U.S. Failed Banks 1989-2015
FDIC Center for Financial Research Working Paper No. 2017-06 John P. O'Keefe and Chiwon A. Yom<.strong>

This Version: October 2017
Abstract
We find evidence that material insider abuse and internal fraud were present in approximately 457 (37 percent) of the 1,237 U.S. failed commercial and mutual savings banks (hereafter, banks) between 1989 and 2015. Using a unique dataset of the incidence of insider abuse and internal fraud among U.S. failed banks we analyze the characteristics of failed banks with the ultimate goal of developing fraud detection models—parametric (logistic regression, Benford digit analysis) and non-parametric (neural networks). We obtain information on the incidence of insider abuse and internal fraud among failed banks from failing bank cases prepared for the FDIC Board of Directors, restitution orders (fines) supervisors assessed for bank employee fraud, and bond claims the FDIC made to recover fraud-related losses on failed banks. The supervisory data we use to quantify fraud among failed banks has not been used previously in published research and, we feel, provides more comprehensive information on fraud among failed banks than that available to academic researchers. Since fraudulent behavior lies outside the realm of rationale behavior modelled in economics, we develop a framework for internal bank fraud that provides rationale and support for our fraud detection models. This framework is based on previous studies of financial fraud and internal bank fraud in particular. We test this framework using regression analysis of the determinants of fraudulent behavior among failed banks between 1989 and 2015 and find that banks with insider abuse and fraud present overstated income and asset values, under-reported losses and consequently overstated net worth. The regression models of fraudulent failed banks provide information on the financial statement line items that can be used to identify fraud. We next use a recently developed second-order Benford digit test to identify those banks whose financial statements suggest tampering and purposeful misstatement. Our results suggest that material insider abuse and fraud at banks is detectable using Benford digit analysis of bank financial data for a period one-to-four years prior to failure. Unfortunately, we are unable to develop an accurate neural network model for fraud prediction.

Supervisory Discipline and Bank Capital Management: Evidence from Before, During and After the Crisis

This Version: June 2018 Previously circulated as ""Does Depository Discipline Reduce Bank Risk? Evidence from Before, During, and After the Crisis""
Abstract
This paper investigates the effectiveness of supervisory discipline on bank risk over the years immediately before, during and just after the recent crisis. It is the first study to consider the effects of informal supervisory enforcement actions in addition to formal actions. Informal enforcement actions are not only much more numerous than the formal enforcement actions used in previous studies, but they are also often confidential, whereas formal enforcement actions must be public. Access to this information allows a complete analysis of the effects of regulatory enforcement actions on bank capital. Pre-crisis, results strongly support the risk-reducing (capital enhancing) effects of informal actions and find that using only information on formal actions leads to substantial bias. During the crisis, formal actions became a much more effective tool for slowing declines in a bank’s capital ratios and informal actions were relatively less potent. Post-crisis, while it appears that the effects of enforcement actions are moving back toward the “normal” times of the pre-crisis period, the statistical relationship between supervisory discipline and target capital is less clear. In all three periods banks had strong incentives to achieve their capital targets while they were in the higher prompt corrective action capital zones. TARP capital helped quicken a bank’s adjustment speed to its capital target during the crisis, but appears to slow this speed post-crisis.

Abstract
In order for deposit insurers to be able to maintain public confidence following a bank failure, they must be able to act quickly to repay depositors and adequately fund the resolution of failed institutions. According to the International Association of Deposit Insurers, the best measure of deposit insurer funding adequacy is the Target Fund Ratio, the deposit insurance fund divided by total insured deposits, and each country’s fund target will vary based on institutional needs. This paper presents a framework to assist countries, especially data-poor ones, in developing such a funding target. The paper employs a simulation approach that combines probability of default, loss given default, default correlation, and exposure at default to yield Target Fund Ratios required for the deposit insurer to remain solvent across a variety of different economic environments. This paper then uses the U.S. as an example country and compares results of the method to U.S. experiences and policy decisions.

Using a recently developed method of causal inference, this paper estimates the additional up-front loan origination costs that a small business can expect to pay when it first borrows from a new lender. I compare firms that borrow from a previously-unused financial institution with firms that borrow from a financial institution with which they have a preexisting financial relationship. I estimate that firms that borrow from a new financial institution can expect to pay $5,650 to $6,980 more in closing costs than firms that return to a previously-used financial institution. Based on these findings, I argue that a central function of origination fees is to pay for the production of detailed, firm-specific information that is valuable to the lender. I study a natural quasi-experiment wherein, for a small group of firms, selection into borrowing from a new lender is close to random. Returning to the wider population of small business borrowers, I use the method of Altonji, Elder, and Taber (2002, 2005) to account for endogeneity in firm's selection to borrow from a new lender. The method of Altoji, Elder, and Taber allows me to measure the degree to which a firm's selection to borrow from a new lender is driven by unobservables that also determine closing costs and to correct for any resulting bias. All analyses confirm that borrowing from a new financial institution causes firms to pay higher loan origination costs.

Does Deposit Insurance Promote Financial Depth? Evidence from the Postal Savings System During the 1920s

Abstract
This paper tests whether deposit insurance promotes financial depth by influencing depositor behavior. To do so, we rely on two schemes operating in the U.S. during the 1920s: the Postal Savings System and the deposit insurance schemes that some states had adopted. We exploit the discontinuity in deposit insurance across state borders and compute changes in postal savings deposits in cities located along the borders of states that did and did not have deposit insurance. We examine the relative growth of postal savings deposits in pairs of border cities when bank suspensions occurred within a short radius (10, 20, and 30 miles). Our results indicate that, following a bank suspension within a 10-mile radius, deposits in postal savings offices located in the non-deposit insurance state increased by 16 percent more than deposits in the neighboring postal savings office located in the deposit insurance state. The magnitude of the effect declines with bank suspension distance. It disappears when deposit insurance is not in effect. Using county-level data, we find that deposit insurance is associated with a 56 percent increase in local banking capacity.

Global Banks and Syndicated Loan Spreads: Evidence from U.S. Banks
FDIC Center for Financial Research Working Paper No. 2017-01 Edith X. Liu and Jonathan Pogach

Abstract
This paper explores the relationship between bank global exposure and their syndicated loan spreads. Linking syndicated loan information from Dealscan with confidential US bank foreign exposure data and borrower characteristics, we find that more bank global exposure is associated with a higher loan spread that is statistically significant. To analyze this relationship between global banks and loan spreads, we develop a theoretical framework where, in equilibrium, riskier borrowers are more likely to work with global banks. Using a Heckman selection model, we confirm that borrower risk characteristics indeed predict a higher likelihood of having a loan arranged by a global bank. However, after controlling for the bank-borrower selection effect, we continue to find that global banks charge on average an 12.7 bps higher spread on their syndicated loans, as compared with domestically focused banks. Finally, we explore a non-risk based alternative where firms with multinational operations are more likely to work with global banks for international banking services.

Affected by Severe Storms and Flooding in Louisiana
Scams and Fraudulent Acts
Q. How can I protect against fraud or scams?
A. Protect your personal and financial information. Do not divulge your bank or credit card
numbers or other personal information over the phone unless you initiated the conversation
with the other party and you know that party is reputable. Be wary of imposters who contact
you claiming to be government employees or volunteers and who ask for personal financial
information or money. Reject offers to cash a check for someone in exchange for a fee, even
if the bank makes the funds available to you right away, as it may turn out that the check was
fraudulent.
Be careful before accepting unsolicited offers of repairs or other assistance. Deal only with
licensed and insured home-repair contractors and get recommendations from people you
know and trust. To check out a local business, including complaints against it, start by
contacting your state Attorney General’s office or your state or local consumer affairs office.
In addition, get prices and other key details in writing and take your time to read and
understand anything you are asked to sign.
Identity Theft / Verification
Q. What should I do if I am worried about identity (ID) theft?
A. If you feel ID theft is a concern, or have reason to believe you may be a victim of ID theft, you
may place a ""fraud alert"" on your credit file by contacting the fraud department at one of the
three major credit bureaus for which contact information appears below.
This can help prevent a thief from opening new accounts or making changes to your
existing accounts. However, be aware that placing an alert on your account may
prevent you from opening an account unless the bank can contact you and positively
confirm your identity.

http://www.ftc.gov/idtheft.
 As always, protect your Social Security number, bank account and credit card numbers, and
other personal information, especially in response to unsolicited requests from strangers.
Fraudsters may try to trick you into divulging personal information, or they may steal
sensitive mail or documents from homes and offices.

Q. Severe storms and flooding forced me to evacuate without my personal IDs or
financial records. How do I rebuild my financial records?
A. These tips will help you begin to re-establish your financial records:
 Replace your driver’s license or state identification (ID) card. A driver’s license and a
state ID card for non-drivers are the most commonly used IDs for proof of identity. These
documents should be replaced as soon as possible. Contact information appears below:
Louisiana Office of Motor Vehicles at http://omv.dps.state.la.us/
 Replace your Social Security card.
The Social Security Administration’s (SSA) card replacement process requires
another form of identification, such as a driver’s license. For more information, call
1-800-772-1213 (TTY 1-800-325-0778), or go to www.SSA.gov and click on “Get Or
Replace A Social Security Card.” Information about Social Security benefit payments
also is available at www.socialsecurity.gov/emergency.
 Consider replacing other documents that may serve as proof of identity, such as:
 Passport  Marriage or divorce record
 Employer ID card  Adoption record
 School ID card  Health insurance card (not a Medicare card)
 Military ID card  Life insurance policy
 Replace your credit cards, debit cards, and checks and inquire about your safe deposit box.
 Contact your financial institution. You can call the FDIC’s toll-free number 1-877-ASK-
FDIC (1-877-275-3342) for bank contact information. Once connected, your financial
institution should explain the process for replacing your cards, checks, and financial
records. If you kept documents in your bank’s safe deposit box, you may want to inquire
whether the boxes are intact.
You also can contact your credit card issuer if your credit card was not issued by a financial
institution, or you are unsure what financial institution issued your card. Contact information
for the four major credit card issuers appears below:
 American Express - 1-800-528-4800 or TDD 1-800-992-3404

 Visa – 1-800-VISA-911 (1-800-847-2911)
https://usa.visa.com

 If you do not remember the credit cards you have, you can obtain your credit report from
one of the three major credit bureaus (Equifax at 1-800-525-6285, Experian at 1-888-397-
3742, or TransUnion at 1-800-680-7289). Your credit report should list all credit cards in
your name; a copy of this information may be provided to you at no cost under federal law.
For details, contact a central service set up by the credit bureaus at 1-877-322-8228, or go
to www.AnnualCreditReport.com.
Credit Issues
Q. I am no longer working due to the storm and don't have the income to live on and meet
my payments. If I miss loan payments, how will this affect my credit? Will I be charged
late fees?
A. The FDIC is encouraging banks to be understanding during this time and work with customers
seriously affected by the severe storms and flooding. In certain situations, the FDIC is asking
banks to allow customers to defer loan payments with no adverse consequences for the
borrower, extend loan terms, and restructure loans. However, before deferring payments or
changing the terms of the loan, contact your bank to determine its flexibility during this time.
Q. I need financing until insurance checks come in, and I can find another job. Will banks
help?
A. We understand that not all banks provide unsecured loans, but the FDIC has encouraged
banks to consider working constructively with affected consumers to meet their lending
needs.
Other Recovery Tips
Q: What are other tips to start the recovery process?
A. Report property damage to your property insurance company or agent as soon as possible. To
the extent possible, do not throw away damaged goods or make major repairs until a claims
adjuster visits your residence. Keep receipts for emergency repairs. Also:
 Look into federal assistance for survivors of natural disasters. This may include special
loans for homeowners, small business owners, or farmers to repair or replace damaged
property. Visit www.disasterassistance.gov to learn more. You also can call the Federal
Emergency Management Agency at 1-800-621-FEMA (1-800-621-3362).
 Immediately contact your creditors if you don’t think you can pay your bills or make
credit card or loan payments on time. Paying your debts late or not at all can result in
penalties, interest charges, and damage to your credit score. Your creditors likely will
work with you on a solution, but it’s important to contact them as soon as possible and
explain your situation.
3
 If you have additional concerns or a complaint with a business such as a financial
institution or an insurance company, be proactive. Contact the firm directly. If that
doesn’t produce the desired results, you may contact the appropriate federal or state
regulatory agency for help or guidance.
 Seek help from non-profit organizations in your area. Their financial assistance programs
may include services such as counseling, free legal assistance, and low-interest business
loans.
 Louisiana renters with flood damage may be eligible for federal help, as described in the
following Federal Emergency Management Agency resource: http://www.fema.gov/news-
release/2016/08/26/louisiana-renters-flood-damage-may-be-eligible-federal-help

RE: Potential Violations of Section 18(a)(4) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act
Dear Mr. Nelli:
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) has reason to believe that Zil Money Corporation
(“Zil”) has made false and misleading statements, directly or by implication, concerning Zil’s insured
status, in violation of section 18(a)(4) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (“FDI Act”), 12 U.S.C. §
1828(a)(4) (“Section 18(a)(4)”), and its implementing regulation, 12 C.F.R. Part 328, Subpart B (“Part
328”). We hereby demand that you cease and desist and take immediate corrective actions to address
these false and misleading statements, as more fully set forth below.
Section 18(a)(4) and Part 328 prohibit any person from knowingly misrepresenting the extent or manner
in which a deposit or obligation is insured under the FDI Act, whether by making affirmative statements
or by omitting material information. Pursuant to Part 328, a statement regarding deposit insurance
would be deemed to omit material information if the absence of such information could result in a
reasonable consumer being unable to understand the extent or manner of deposit insurance provided.
See generally 12 C.F.R. § 328.102(b). For example, it is a material omission for a non-insured entity that
advertises deposit insurance to fail to identify the insured depository institution (IDI) with which the
representing party has a direct or indirect business relationship for the placement of deposits and into
which the consumer’s deposits may be placed. 12 C.F.R. § 328.102(b)(5). The FDIC has the authority to
enforce these provisions against any person or entity. Enforcement tools available to the FDIC include the
authority to issue cease-and-desist orders and to assess civil money penalties for violations of Section
18(a)(4) and Part 328. See 12 C.F.R. §§ 328.104-107.
Certain statements by Zil, which appeared on Zil’s website, https://zilbank.com/, and other media, have
come to the attention of the FDIC as containing apparent misrepresentations about FDIC deposit
insurance. These statements include, but are not limited to, the following:
• “The insurance covers up to $250,000 per depositor, per account, in FDIC-insured institutions like
Zil.” See https://zilbank.com/importance-of-fdic-insurance/.
• “Our platform is an online bank that is FDIC-insured.” See https://zilbank.com/best-business-
bank-accounts-for-your-business-needs/.
www.fdic.gov
page 1
LEGAL DIVISION
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
• “Zil is an FDIC insurance bank.” See https://zilbank.com/zil-an-online-fdic-insurance-bank-for-
all-business-purposes/.
• “ZilBank.com ensures your peace of mind by being FDIC insured.” See https://zilbank.com/best-
online-bank-account-2023/.
• “Banks provide [sic] shield businesses from any fraud that has taken place in their checking
accounts. These can include incorrect vendor checks or employee fraud brought on by excessive
account access, which makes it hard to track transactions. The checking account provided by Zil
is FDIC insured, and also our online bank eliminates fraudulent activities on your checking
account by providing state-of-the art protection.” See https://zilbank.com/go-for-the-best-
business-bank-today/.
All of the statements highlighted above appear to represent or imply that Zil is an FDIC-insured bank and
that FDIC deposit insurance would protect consumers in the event that Zil becomes insolvent or in the
event of “any fraud.” In fact, FDIC only insures funds in accounts at an FDIC-insured bank in the event of
the insured bank’s failure. Accordingly, Zil’s statements misrepresent the extent or manner of deposit
insurance by implying Zil itself is an FDIC-insured bank that provides deposit insurance directly to
consumers, in violation of Section 18(a)(4) and Part 328.
Furthermore, many of Zil’s representations regarding the availability of FDIC deposit insurance appear to
fail to identify the IDI(s) into which consumers’ deposits may be placed. Because the name of the IDI into
which consumers’ funds may be placed is necessary for a consumer to understand the extent or manner
of deposit insurance provided, the absence of such information from the statements is a material
omission and thus the statements violate Part 328.
Based on the information available to the FDIC, it appears that the statements discussed above regarding
deposit insurance violate Section 18(a)(4) of the FDI Act and Part 328. Consequently, the FDIC hereby
demands the following corrective actions:
1. You shall immediately remove any and all statements, representations, or references that suggest
in any way, explicitly or implicitly, that: (a) Zil is FDIC-insured; (b) FDIC deposit insurance may
provide coverage for any event other than the failure of an IDI; or (c) FDIC deposit insurance
provides protection or coverage in any manner or extent other than those set forth in the FDI Act,
from the Zil website (including any blog posts, pop-ups, hyperlinks, or chatbots) and any other
related websites operated by Zil, X (formerly known as Twitter) and any other social media
platforms (including corporate accounts and personal accounts of senior management of Zil, and
any paid advertisement on these platforms), the mobile app, online outlet, and any other forms
(electronic or hard copy) of marketing, advertising, or other consumer-facing publications.
2. You shall cease and desist from making any statements, representations, or references that
suggest in any way, explicitly or implicitly, that: (a) Zil is FDIC-insured; (b) FDIC deposit insurance
may provide coverage for any event other than the failure of an IDI; or (c) FDIC deposit insurance
provides protection or coverage in any manner or extent other than those set forth in the FDI Act,
from the Zil website (including any blog posts, pop-ups, hyperlinks, or chatbots) and any other
related websites operated by Zil, X and any other social media platforms (including both

corporate accounts and personal accounts of senior management of Zil, and any paid
advertisement on these platforms), the mobile app, online outlet, and any other forms (electronic
or hard copy) of marketing, advertising, or other consumer-facing publications.
3. To the extent that Zil’s representations relate to pass-through deposit insurance arising from the
placement of consumer deposits into accounts at IDIs, you shall amend such statements to: (1)
clearly and accurately identify the nature of such deposit insurance and (2) identify the IDI(s) with
which Zil has a direct or indirect relationship for the placement of deposits and into which
consumers’ funds may be deposited.
4. Within fifteen (15) days of receipt of this letter, you shall provide written confirmation to the FDIC
that Zil has fully complied with the requests set forth above. Such confirmation shall detail all
efforts undertaken to comply with this letter, including all efforts to identify and locate all
misrepresentations and the specific actions you took.
If you believe that any statement Zil or its officers have made related to FDIC deposit insurance is true
and accurate, please provide a full listing of all such statements about deposit insurance on any medium
or platform, which you allege to be true and accurate, together with information and documentation
supporting the basis for your belief in the accuracy of all such statements, no later than fifteen (15) days
from the date of this letter.
Failure to timely respond to this letter may result in the FDIC taking appropriate action as authorized by
the FDI Act and any other applicable law or regulation. Be advised that this letter is intended to address
only potential violations of Section 18(a)(4) and Part 328, as described above. Your response to this
matter may or may not affect our conclusions as to the potential violations identified above, and does
not preclude the FDIC from taking any further action, as appropriate, with respect to the foregoing or any
other violations of laws or regulations. Moreover, nothing in this matter bars or estops any other federal
or state agency from investigating, or pursuing actions for, violations of other laws and regulations.
This letter constitutes an advisory letter within the meaning of 12 C.F.R. § 328.106. Accordingly, pursuant
to 12 C.F.R. § 328.102(b)(6), continuing and/or future false or misleading deposit insurance
representations may be deemed to have been knowingly made.
Should you have any questions about the contents of this letter, please contact Counsel , at

Scammers are constantly trying to steal your money and your personal information, and they use a variety of ways to try to trick you. Scammers often pretend to be from an organization you might know and trust (such as an FDIC-insured bank) and try to get your personal information. FDIC can help you verify whether a website is a fake bank website or the legitimate website of an FDIC-insured bank.
There are a number of ways scammers try to reach you, too. The term “phishing” is when scammers try to reach you by email or on a website. Similarly, “smishing” is when criminals use text messaging to reach you. The word “vishing” is when these scammers call you and try to trick you into providing personal information by sounding like a legitimate business or government official. Learn how to identify these scams and better protect yourself and your money.
Am I dealing with a legitimate, FDIC-insured bank?
Criminals create fake bank websites to mislead and entice people into transferring money or disclosing personal information. This scam is a form of “phishing.” Some of these fake bank websites use the FDIC name or “Member FDIC” logo to instill a false sense of security. Sometimes it is hard to tell which websites are real, and which are fakes. Before engaging with any website for an entity that claims to be an FDIC-insured bank, it is important to make sure that the website real.
To help you determine if a website belongs to an FDIC-insured bank, check the FDIC BankFind , a data resource on the FDIC website. You can look up banks by name or website address to verify whether they are a real FDIC-insured bank. Compare the bank name with the web address or URL. Watch for letters out of place or the bank name as a sub web address of the fake name. If you are in doubt or identify a suspicious website related to FDIC insurance, please contact the FDIC National Center for Consumer and Depositor Assistance (NCDA) at 1-877-ASK-FDIC ( 1-877-275-3342 ) to speak with a deposit insurance specialist or go to ask.fdic.gov .
Malicious apps
Scammers also develop banking apps that may install malicious software or “malware” on your phone or tablet. If you download a malicious app to your device, the malware can steal personal information from it or lock it and hold it for ransom until you pay the scammers. Other types of malicious apps may ask you to login using your social media or email accounts, which could expose your personal information for the scammers to steal.
If you do download an app, be careful of apps or websites that ask for suspicious permissions, such as granting access to your contacts, text messages, stored passwords, or credit card information. Also, poor grammar or misspelled words in an app description or on a website are red flags that it may not be legitimate.
Text messages from scammers
Scammers may use text messaging to reach you too, known as “smishing.” They may pretend they are from your bank and try to get you to provide your personal information. The text message often looks like a bank security message. Note that these fraudulent messages often try to create a sense of urgency to make you provide your personal information faster and less carefully. Take your time and call your bank using a phone number that you are familiar with, for example, the number provided on your debit or credit card. Do not use a phone number provided by someone you are unfamiliar with or that you think may be a scammer. As an alternative, contact the FDIC before you provide any information when something does not seem right.
Email links
Just like text message scams, avoid clicking on links in unsolicited emails or emails from unfamiliar sources. Some links may download malware (malicious software, such as computer viruses) to your device when you click on them. This is another form of “phishing.” The malware may steal your banking information, including your username, passwords, and credit or debit card numbers. Some links may lead to an illegitimate website attempting to get you to enter your personal information. These emails typically look very similar to ones sent by familiar sources like well-known retailers, banks, and other entities.
Be on the lookout for emails with typos, obvious mistakes, unusual fonts, that create a sense of urgency, or just seem off. In addition, be skeptical of email attachments described as coupons, rebates, or payment forms – they could include malware. Moreover, avoid email offers that seem “too good to be true.” Also watch for fee-related scams. This type of scam is where the scammer requests you to send money or pay “FDIC insurance fees” to receive a large amount of money in return. As a reminder, the FDIC does not charge or collect fees from consumers.
No matter how the scammers try to reach you, following the tips highlighted in this article will help keep you and your money safe.

on Commerce, Consumer, and Monetary Affairs, FDIC Chairman William Seidman highlighted the alarming rise in bank fraud and insider abuse, which has significantly impacted the banking industry and the FDIC insurance fund since 1982. The FDIC reported that nearly one-third of bank failures between January 1985 and June 1987 involved elements of fraud, leading to substantial financial losses. To combat this issue, the FDIC has implemented various measures, including improved training for examiners, mandatory criminal reporting, and proposals for independent audits of banks above certain asset thresholds.

L. WILLIAM SEIDMAN, CHAIRMAN
FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION
9:30 a.m.
Thursday, November 19, 1987
Room 2247, Rayburn House Office Building
Good morning, Mr. Chairman and members of the Subcommittee. I am pleased to
be here today to express the views of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation on this very important subject ~ fraud and abuse of position in
the nation's financial institutions. The FDIC staff has prepared detailed
answers to the questions contained in your letter of invitation. The staff's
report is attached to this statement and I request that it be included in the
record.
FRAUD AND INSIDER ABUSE
The number of insured banks that have been victimized by fraud and insider
abuse has increased dramatically since 1982 resulting in greater costs to the
banking industry and to the FDIC insurance fund. However, while bank fraud is
a major concern and area of focus for the FDIC, bank fraud is not at such a
level that the safety of the banking system is imperiled.
Bank failures are occurring at a post-depression record rate. We expect about
200 failures this year. As of today, 160 banks already have failed. We had
expected a break in this upward trend next year. However, we are now
reassessing our projections in light of the recent correction in the stock
market and its potential adverse effects on the economy.
We are seeing evidence of insider abuse and fraud in as many as one third of
the banks that fail. The ""autopsies"" the FDIC conducts in the wake of bank
failures also show that outright criminal activity is a factor in nearly 15
percent of recent failures.
2
- -
From January 1985 through June 1987, 98 of the 354 banks that failed were
cited by examiners as having at least some element of fraud or insider abuse.
These 98 banks had assets of $2.70 billion and the cost to the FDIC of these
failures is estimated to be nearly $676 million.
While fraud losses in failed banks are still significant, our experience since
1985 suggests a somewhat lessened impact of fraud and abuse compared to the
period studied by your Subcommittee leading to its 1984 report. Our current
experience is more in line with the historical trend and is consistent with
the impact of fraud and abuse reported in an FDIC study of bank failures
between 1960 and 1974.
The FDIC has taken several major steps to improve our supervisory response to
fraud and abuse in the banks we supervise. Since the Subcommittee's 1984
report, we have:
• Completely revised the criminal reporting system to require banks, by
regulation, to report apparent crimes to U.S. attorneys, federal
investigators and the FDIC on a standard referral form.
• Established a network of personal contacts to improve communication and
cooperation with law enforcement agencies.
• Published a list of time tested ""Red Flags"" and other warning signs of
fraud and abuse to be used as an aid by examiners and auditors.
t Designated some 60 senior examiners as bank fraud specialists to be
given specialized training in bank fraud and insider abuse.
- 3 -
t Improved and greatly increased the training opportunities for examiners,
investigators, liquidators and prosecutors by the addition of an
interagency school on white collar crime, joint FBI/examiner training
sessions and expanded treatment in the FDIC schools.
• Designated special review examiners and regional counsel in regional
offices to prepare criminal referrals, coordinate investigative
assistance and testimony and to advise banks and other examiners on
criminal laws and criminal referral requirements.
• Provided liquidators and other employees of our Division of Liquidation
with special training and refresher courses on bank fraud and abuse and
investigation techniques.
• Installed a computer system to collect information about criminal
referrals for tracking and analytical purposes and to identify subjects
of criminal referrals by name recognition.
• Decentralized and streamlined our civil enforcement process.
Delegations of authority to Regional Directors permits expeditious and
efficient administrative actions while maintaining Washington control
over issues that are controversial or raise policy questions.
I would like to repeat that current levels of bank fraud, while serious and
costly, do not jeopardize the banking system. At the same time, the rising
level of failures, and the increased cost of insider abuse and fraudulent
behavior, raise issues that we need to explore.
I commend you, Mr. Chairman, for challenging us with some very important
questions:
• How do we improve the audit capabilities of banks to prevent and detect
fraud and abuse?
t How do we insure that all bank directors adhere to high standards of
conduct?
• How do we improve intergovernmental coordination and information sharing
to assure vigorous investigations and prosecution of criminal conduct?
INDEPENDENT AUDITS OF BANKS
First, I would like to comment on our proposal to require independent audits
of banks. We estimate that around two thirds of the banks in this country
already get opinion audits. As would be expected, larger banking
organizations are more likely to have independent audits. But even so, about
half the banks under $50 million in assets get outside audits.
Nevertheless, more small banks would be impacted by an audit requirement than
large banks. And, the smaller the bank, the more difficult a cost effective
audit becomes.
We have reviewed about 250 of the banks that failed in 1986 and during the
first nine months of 1987. We found that only 40 percent of those banks had
an outside audit written during the two years prior to failure. In other
words, it appears that deeply troubled banks are much less likely to have an
- 5 -
outside audit. We also found that about 40 percent of the failed banks, with
opinion audits, had received qualified opinions from their auditors. Clearly,
these audits would have provided information that could have been used by bank
supervisors.
We appear to be near agreement with the other bank regulators on requiring
annual audits for all banks over a certain asset size threshold. We now are
considering a threshold in the range of $100 to $150 million in assets.
Our current proposal would require each state nonmember bank above a threshold
size to:
t Engage an independent public accountant to perform an opinion audit each
calendar year.
t Have the bank's board of directors perform a timely review of the
auditors report and the management letter, with such review noted on the
board of directors' minutes. The bank would be required to send copies
of these reports to the FDIC.
t Require the bank to notify the FDIC when the bank changes its
independent auditor.
We also are considering your idea, Mr. Chairman, of requiring banks to show
their auditors the bank's latest examination report.
We also are reviewing the possibility of developing something 1 ess than an
audit for smaller banks (those under the yet-to-be established threshold). In
6
- -
other words, we are considering requiring something in the nature of a
""checkup"" rather than a ""complete physical"" — something that smaller banks
would find affordable and that focuses on potential problem areas such as
internal controls and insider abuse. We have challenged the AICPA to help us
develop a program specially designed for a cost effective examination of small
banks.
We believe outside audits can benefit the supervision process, as well as
shoring up the internal operations of insured banks and aiding in fraud
prevention and detection.
DIRECTORS' RESPONSIBILITY AND CODES OF CONDUCT
We also believe that the supervisory process benefits greatly if bank
directors adhere to and are held to high standards of conduct and
responsibility. While it is true that the great majority of bank directors
already meet these high standards, we nevertheless felt it necessary to
emphasize this point to all present and prospective bank directors.
The FDIC, along with other agencies, just released final guidelines under the
Bank Bribery Statute encouraging banks to establish and maintain effective
codes of conduct. The FDIC also has just issued guidelines advising bank
directors in ""plain English"" of their responsibilities to oversee the conduct
of the bank's business, to keep informed and exercise independent judgment.
The guidelines advocate the avoidance of all preferential transactions
involving insiders and related interests and advise directors of their
critical role in keeping the banking system safe and sound.
- T i
INTERAGENCY TEAMWORK
In December of 1984, the Attorney General established an interagency group to
deal with fraud and abuse. This ""teamwork"" approach has been very successful
in coordinating efforts at the headquarters level. Real progress also is
being made at the local level, where information in one form or another is
critical to the success of specific investigations and prosecutions.
We have been pleased with the commitment demonstrated by the Justice
Department's Criminal Division and believe that this commitment is evident in
the accomplishments of the Working Group. We also are pleased with the
efforts of many U.S. Attorneys to carry this commitment to their local
districts. Unquestionably, local forums such as the one established in
Chicago represent an effective solution to problems relating to coordination
and cooperation. We would like to see more of these forums established,
particularly in districts having a heavy load of bank fraud cases.
AGENCIES' JOINT ENFORCEMENT PROPOSAL
A working group of the financial institution agencies recently completed a
proposal to amend the enforcement statutes to improve the agencies' ability to
address instances of insider abuse, misconduct and fraud at our nation's
depository institutions. The amendments clarify the enforcement powers of the
agencies in several respects, codify current administrative interpretations
and address certain anomalies created by a recent U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals decision.
8
- -
Several of the amendments contained in that proposal amend the Right to
Financial Privacy Act (RFPA). Currently, the flow of information that is
critical to successful prosecutions and effective bank supervision is unduly
constrained by the RFPA. Probably the most adverse impact of the RFPA on our
cooperative efforts to deal with fraud and abuse is the psychological
impediment the Act exerts on the interactions between examiners and law
enforcement agents. We will never know how many cases have been jeopardized
by this chilling effect. However, we do not doubt that the public interest
has been harmed by RFPA constraints on intergovernmental exchanges of
information.
One case is particularly illustrative. During a criminal investigation of a
failed bank, the FBI learned of the whereabouts of millions of dollars.
Because of legal restrictions, however, this crucial information could not be
passed on to the FDIC. Thus, the FDIC lost the opportunity to restore
millions of dollars to the FDIC insurance fund. Amending the RFPA as
recommended by the Bank Fraud Working Group and this legislative proposal
would enhance greatly our cooperative efforts with Justice in ferreting out
and prosecuting fraud and abuse.
CONCLUSION
In conclusion, bank fraud and abuse is costly and serious but does not imperil
the banking system. We cannot let up on ferreting out and penalizing fraud
and abuse until a strong deterrent to such activities is firmly established.
Thank your Mr. Chairman.","[ 0.03616769 -0.00919101  0.03232133 ... -0.03786725 -0.02079717

Interest rate risk sensitivity is garnering attention, given shifts in rates and trends in bank balance sheet information. This article reviews the current interest rate environment, analyzes aggregate bank balance sheet composition, and identifies potential risks associated with a rising rate environment. Findings from recent bank examination reports in which sensitivity to interest rate risk was considered problematic are reviewed, and identified weaknesses in risk measurement and modeling practices are highlighted. Examination findings generally indicate that the vast majority of insured institutions are managing exposure to interest rate sensitivity effectively.
First in a series about the enforcement action process as it applies to individuals, this article focuses on fraud and other misconduct by insiders and discusses internal control weaknesses that contribute to the perpetration of fraud. An overview of the statutory authority and policies that form the basis for FDIC enforcement actions in these instances is included.
Insured institutions have increased their use of credit scoring systems significantly. Although the proper use of these systems can help minimize the potential for unlawful discrimination, improper use can result in overt discrimination or disparate treatment, which could lead to fair lending violations. This article provides an overview of credit scoring systems and a conceptual framework for conducting a fair lending examination when a credit score is a factor in the lending decision.
Federal bank regulatory agencies and internal loan review departments traditionally have relied on a delinquency-based approach to evaluate automobile loan portfolios. However, heightened competition, combined with lax underwriting standards and lending controls, may require closer internal review and regulatory scrutiny. This article addresses risk management and consumer compliance risks associated with indirect auto lending programs and uses case studies to identify processes and procedures to control and mitigate those risks.
In light of the increasing use of outsourcing arrangements for information technology services, this article provides an overview of the potential risks posed by technology service providers (TSPs) to insured institutions and offers a framework for analyzing these companies that incorporates publicly available information into the examination planning process. Combining supervisory information with carefully mined information and data from public sources will strengthen the development and maintenance of accurate and meaningful TSP risk profiles.
Questions about the circumstances in which investors should recognize other-than-temporary impairments of investment securities have been a recent focus of financial institutions, their auditors, and the Financial Accounting Standards Board. This article discusses currently applicable accounting literature on impairment and its relationship to the examination process.

The Winter 2006 issue of Supervisory Insights featured an article that serves as a ""field guide"" 1 to unfair or deceptive acts or practices (UDAPs) under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (FTC Act). As noted therein, ""UDAPs are not always apparent or easily discovered,"" making compliance and compliance supervision in this critical area especially challenging. 2 To aid compliance professionals in meeting their UDAP oversight responsibilities, the FDIC's Division of Supervision and Consumer Protection (DSC), during an 18 month period, 3 surveyed UDAP issues identified and analyzed through the FDIC's examination--consultation process. 4
The primary focus of this article is on the analytics used in determining an FTC Act violation, rather than on actual practices. However, it is important to note the following about practices observed specific to overdraft protection programs and services. Though the FDIC has previously issued substantial guidance relating to unfair or deceptive overdraft protection practices, 5 the most common FTC Act violations identified by FDIC examiners during this 18-month UDAP survey involved overdraft protection programs and services. The following were typical overdraft protection practices analyzed by examiners and other FDIC staff for compliance with the FTC Act during this period:
Bank compliance officers should reference FDIC overdraft protection guidance and, along with FDIC examiners, remain vigilant in ensuring overdraft protection programs and services are conducted responsibly and comply with all applicable laws and regulations.
This article highlights the methodology used by FDIC examiners (and other staff) to analyze the FTC Act (Section 5) UDAP issues surveyed during this period. Each FTC Act violation determination turns on the specific facts and circumstances presented. Thus, while a number of practices are identified and addressed, this article is not intended, nor does it attempt, to list a series of citable FTC Act violations. 6 Rather, the goal of this article is to impart, through examples, a better understanding of the approach for determining UDAP violations.
An examiner has discretion to discourage a particular banking practice, regardless of whether that practice is determined to be an FTC Act violation. The FDIC expects all banks to engage in fair and ethical behavior toward consumers and adopt best business practices, including those identified in guidance issued by the FDIC. 7 Failure to do so exposes banks to a variety of risks, even where some practices may not constitute a violation under Section 5 of the FTC Act.
The standards for determining whether an act or practice is unfair or deceptive are independent of each other. 8 Although a specific act or practice may be both unfair and deceptive, an act or practice is prohibited by the FTC Act if it is either unfair or deceptive. Whether an act or practice is unfair or deceptive, in each instance, will depend on a careful application of the appropriate standard to the particular facts and circumstances. What follows is a discussion, based on examples from FDIC UDAP examination-consultations (consultations), of analyses performed by FDIC staff (consultants) in determining the existence of a violation of Section 5 of the FTC Act. The representative sets of facts in these particular consultations relate to advertising and credit card lending.
As stated by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) 9 and subsequently adopted by the FDIC, 10 a three-part test is used to assess whether a representation, omission, or practice is deceptive under Section 5 of the FTC Act:
The practices described below are only illustrative of each component of the three-part test for deception. Their inclusion (and any finding that the examined practices satisfy one part of the test) should not be interpreted as an ultimate finding that the practices are deceptive in violation of Section 5 of the FTC Act.
For a representation, omission, or practice to be deceptive under Section 5 of the FTC Act, it must mislead or be likely to mislead a consumer. The facts in Advertising Consultation #1 describe how a bank used direct marketing to solicit credit card business. To entice potential customers, the bank's credit card solicitations prominently featured a Cash Back Reward program (i.e., use of the credit card would garner cash awards; the greater the card's use, the greater the rewards). In determining whether the bank's solicitation practices were likely to mislead consumers, the consultants reviewed five documents comprising the solicitation (a mailing envelope, a folded brochure, a solicitation letter, an application form, and a summary of terms and conditions) and found the following:
In concluding that the bank's credit card solicitation practices were likely to mislead a consumer, the consultants noted that the bank promoted ""6% Cash Back"" in 13 places throughout the solicitation documents. The consultants further observed that the bank failed to adequately disclose that the actual ""Cash Back"" reward in a chosen bonus category is tiered, with only 0.5% earned on the first $10,000 in purchases, and with the maximum ""6% Cash Back"" earned only on ""Bonus category qualifying purchases"" between $40,001 and $50,000. Additionally, the solicitation failed to disclose (or otherwise qualify), in close proximity to any of the 13 occurrences of the phrase ""6% Cash Back,"" the tiered nature of the ""Cash Back"" reward structure. Also, the bank's use in its solicitation of the qualifying words ""up to"" for non -bonus category purchases (e.g., ""and up to 2% Cash Back on all other purchases"") tended to reinforce a message that a tiered structure for bonus category purchases (a category which would seemingly always earn ""6% Cash Back"") did not exist. In addition, the consultants found that the solicitation was misleading in that no ""Cash Back"" reward at all is paid unless and until the earned rewards within the year reached $50. Consequently, to receive any bonus, a consumer would have to spend at least $10,000 on purchases ($10,000 x .50% = $50) in their Bonus Category between the time the card is issued and the closing date of his or her twelfth statement. The consultants noted that the bank's repetitive use of the phrase ""6% Cash Back,"" lacking any qualification, falsely suggests that a 6% bonus is immediately available on all bonus category purchases.
Representations should be sufficiently qualified within an advertisement or direct solicitation to avoid the likelihood of misleading consumers. Furthermore, the likelihood of a consumer being misled by an advertisement or direct solicitation increases with the repetitiveness of the unqualified representation. In Advertising Consultation #1, the bank repeatedly promoted ""6% Cash Back"" throughout its solicitation documents when, in practice, due to the ""tiered"" structure of the Reward Program, the reward earned was far less than the amount stated in the solicitation documents. In fact, as a result of the program's ""tiered"" structure, the consumer could never earn, on overall purchases, the amount of rewards stated in the solicitation. Thus, the consultants concluded that the bank's practice of omitting qualifying information in its credit card solicitation materials concerning its Cash Back Reward program was likely to mislead consumers.
In determining whether a consumer's interpretation of a representation, omission, or practice is reasonable, the totality of the circumstances and the net impression of the solicitation must be evaluated. For instance, in Advertising Consultation #1, the consultants found that, viewed as a whole, the credit card solicitation was likely to mislead a reasonable consumer in that it gives the false impression that a 6% cash bonus is available for all purchases in a chosen bonus category.
In Advertising Consultation #2, a consumer's interpretation of a representation and omission was deemed reasonable given the totality of the circumstances and the net impression made. Here, a consumer complained that she received a direct mail solicitation from a bank offering her zero percent interest for 12 months on balance transfers to a new credit card account (new card). She accepted the offer by applying for the new card and requesting a balance transfer on July 3, 2005. A new card account was opened in her name on July 3, 2005. Her balance transfer ($6,000) was posted to the new card account on July 12, 2005, and appeared on the July 2005 periodic statement, which had a closing date of July 24, 2005. Thereafter, she made at least minimum monthly payments as required. She made no other charges, either purchases or cash advances, on this account. When she received the July 2006 periodic statement (which had a closing date of July 24, 2006), she sent a payment for the outstanding balance before the due date reflected on the statement. This payment was posted to her new card account on the actual due date: August 13, 2006. Nevertheless, the bank assessed finance charges, beginning on July 24, 2006, of $19.89, representing interest at the standard rate for purchases on the average daily balance of the account for the July 24-August 23, 2006, billing cycle.
The bank never disclosed to the consumer the actual date that her 12-month promotional zero percent rate would end. In addition, it was difficult for the consumer to accurately calculate the date, given the conflicting and confusing information contained in the direct mail solicitation for the promotional offer and in the card member agreement sent to her when she accepted the offer.
The bank stated that it does not send cardholders any kind of disclosure advising them when the promotional zero percent interest rate expires, because the bank does not know when the balance transfer will be made, how many transfers will be made, and when each one will be processed. Therefore, the bank left it to the consumer to determine when the 12-month promotional period expires based on when the transfer is transacted on the account. The direct mail solicitation to which the consumer responded contained the following information, which became part of the consumer's agreement with the bank:
AS IF 0% INTEREST WASN'T ENOUGH OF A REWARD
0% APR ON BALANCE TRANSFERS FOR 12 MONTHS. Pay off all your high-rate cards and get the most out of [new card account].
No interest for 12 months. No annual fees. Lots and lots of rewards.
IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING YOUR APPLICATION
Information on Balance Transfers. I understand that finance charges will begin to accrue at the time a check is issued to my current credit card institution.
0% APR ON BALANCE TRANSFERS FOR 12 MONTHS. Pay off all your high rate cards and get the most out of [new card account].
[Footnote]: Please note this balance transfer rate applies to balance transfer requests submitted with this acceptance certificate. Then, the balance transfers will receive the standard purchase APR unless otherwise notified.
As stated, for an act or practice to be misleading, the consumer's interpretation of the representation, omission, or practice must be reasonable. In determining whether a consumer's interpretation is reasonable, it is appropriate to look at the entire advertisement, transaction, or course of dealing to determine how a reasonable consumer would respond. In this consultation, it was determined that the consumer's interpretation of the promotional offer and disclosures was reasonable, especially in light of the entire course of dealing between the parties. Here, the consumer received monthly periodic statements showing the remaining balance of the transfer, credit for payments remitted, the new balance, and no finance charges. This was repeated each month for 12 months with no notice from the bank at any time that the new balance on the monthly statement had to be paid by a certain date to avoid finance charges. There was nothing in this course of dealing to warn the consumer that her interpretation of the term of the promotional offer was incorrect (or was not shared by the bank).
Although other interpretations were possible, given the totality of the circumstances and the net impression under the facts in Advertising Consultation #2, the consumer's interpretation of the bank's representation and omission was deemed reasonable.
Although not discussed in Advertising Consultation #2, it must be noted with respect to reasonableness, as the analyses in many of the consultations remind us, where a particular group is being targeted by a bank's representations or marketing practices (for example, the elderly, students, or the financially unsophisticated), the reasonableness of a consumer's interpretation of the representation or practice must be judged from the vantage point of a reasonable member of the targeted group. 11
Diligence must be exercised to ensure that (1) representations made in advertisements are accurate, clear, and sufficiently informative to convey to consumers the message intended and (2) ongoing communications made throughout the account relationship reinforce, not controvert or cloud, the intended advertised message. Here, the consultants concluded the consumer's interpretation of the conflicting representations or repeated omissions, as to when the zero percent promotional interest rate expired, was reasonable given the totality of the circumstances and the net impression.
To find a representation, omission, or practice deceptive under Section 5 of the FTC Act, the representation, omission, or practice must be material . A representation, omission, or practice is material if it is likely to affect a consumer's decision regarding a product or service. Representations about costs are presumed material. Omissions about costs are presumed material when the bank knew or should have known the consumer needed the omitted information to evaluate the cost of a product or service. 12 For instance, in Advertising Consultation #2, the consultants concluded not only that the consumer's interpretation of the bank's representations and omissions was reasonable with respect to when the zero percent introductory interest rate period expired, but that the representations and omissions were material to the consumer's decision regarding when to pay off the outstanding card balance.
In Advertising Consultation #3, the facts present a clear example of materiality within the context of Section 5 of the FTC Act. Here, the bank regularly ran advertisements in local newspapers, on the radio, and through a direct mail campaign that claimed that customers would receive free credit reports. Typically, the language in these advertisements stated: ""Call for a FREE CREDIT REPORT "" or simply "" FREE Credit Report. "" The representation of a free credit report was neither qualified nor conditioned in the advertisements. If a consumer asked for a copy of the report, it was provided free to the consumer. However, if that consumer ultimately applied for and was granted credit, the cost of the credit report would be charged to the consumer at closing. Nothing in the bank's records or promotions suggest that consumers were told they would be charged a fee for the ""free credit report"" if they accepted a loan.
In this instance, the bank's representation that consumers would receive a free credit report is clearly material. The consultants in this case cited several court cases in which the court affirmed the FTC's position that information regarding the price of goods or services is material, because price is likely to affect a consumer's choice of or conduct regarding a product. 13 The consultants also noted the FTC's recognition of the extraordinary drawing power of the use of the word ""free"" in these situations.
All advertisements are designed to excite demand for the advertised article and to call attention to the particular product. But when a prospective customer is offered something ""free,"" it is not unreasonable to assume that the conscious or subconscious appeal involved in the offer will influence his judgment; the value of the so-called ""free"" article will divert the customer from the major inquiry into the quality of the article or of competing articles. 14
It is important to note that a deceptive representation can be expressed, implied, or caused by a material omission. In Advertising Consultation #3, the bank's omission from its advertisement of a free credit report —and subsequent communications—that the consumer, in fact, would be charged the cost of the credit report if the consumer accepted a loan was material.
Representations that go to the heart of a consumer's decision with respect to a bank product or service must be carefully reviewed and monitored for accuracy and clarity. The FDIC deems representations about costs, benefits, or restrictions on the use or availability of a product or service to be material. 15 In Advertising Consultation #3, the bank advertised free credit reports without qualification or condition. However, in practice, when a consumer applied for and was granted a loan, the bank would charge the cost of the credit report to the consumer at the loan closing.
As stated above, the standards for finding an act or practice deceptive have been established by the FTC and adopted by the FDIC. 16 However, unlike deception, the standards for finding an act or practice unfair are codified in Section 5 of the FTC Act. 17 With limited exceptions, 18 whether an act or practice is unfair under Section 5 of the FTC Act must be judged against the three statutory standards. Historically, enforcement actions brought by the FTC and others have focused on deception. However, recent history shows a significant increase in enforcement actions brought under the FTC Act's unfairness standards.
The statutory standards for unfairness are as follows:
In addition to these standards, the FTC Act allows public policy to be considered in determining whether an act or practice is unfair.
The practices described below are illustrative of each component of the three-part test for unfairness. Their inclusion (and any finding that the examined practices satisfy one part of the test) should not be interpreted as an ultimate finding that the practices are unfair in violation of Section 5 of the FTC Act.
To find an act or practice unfair, it must cause or be likely to cause substantial injury to consumers. Substantial injury usually involves monetary harm. 20 Trivial or merely speculative harms (e.g., the emotional impact of an act or practice) are typically insufficient for a finding of substantial injury. However an act or practice that causes (or is likely to cause) even a small amount of monetary harm to one person may meet the substantial injury standard if the act or practice results in (or is likely to result in) harm to a large number of people.
A review of the facts presented in Credit Card Lending Consultation #1 demonstrates how a monetary harm, in the aggregate, was found substantial by consultants even if the harm, on a case-by-case basis, was small. Here, the bank allocated credit card payments (i.e., the required minimum payment) on accounts with multiple-rate tiers in such a way as to credit the balances with lower annual percentage rates (APRs) first. Specifically, for all accounts with multiple-rate tiers (i.e., separate APRs for purchases, cash advances, balance transfers, promotional rates, etc.), the bank applied the consumer's monthly payment exclusively to the lowest rate tier, potentially resulting in the capitalization of interest to the balance with the highest rate. For example, where a customer has both a purchase balance and a balance transfer balance, the lower APRs are typically assigned to balance transfers and the highest assigned to purchase balances. As a result, any payments made by the customer would first be applied exclusively to the balance transfer balance. Unless the payment completely pays off the balance transfer balance, the interest accrued on the purchase balance is capitalized, and the balance increases.
In finding the substantial injury element of the unfairness standard met, the consultants noted how the harm suffered was monetary and concluded that the harm was or could be substantial when multiplied by all cardholders with accounts that had multiple-rate tiers. This standard is met regardless of any actual injury experienced, as long as substantial injury is a likely result of the act or practice.
To find an act or practice unfair, the injury caused by the act or practice must not be reasonably avoidable by consumers. In Credit Card Lending Consultation #2, the bank periodically sent convenience checks to its customers along with their regular credit card statement indicating the offer to use the checks is good until a certain date. The checks are drawn against the customers' credit card accounts and can be used to obtain cash, purchase goods or services, or pay the outstanding balance on another credit account. They are mailed to consumers unsolicited.
Use of the convenience checks is monitored by the bank and can trigger a verification of credit (as disclosed in the card agreement). Their use may represent one factor in the bank's decision to reduce a customer's line of credit. (The account card member agreement discloses the bank's ability to change a customer's line of credit ""without notice"" and ""at any time."") The bank stated that the reasons for reductions of credit limits are obtained from a review of the credit report and a review of its own, internal information.
Injury caused to a group of consumers by a bank's practices, in its totality, may be judged substantial by the FDIC; injury of a similar nature limited to only one consumer may not. Therefore, banks should routinely examine their business practices to ensure such practices do not (or are not likely to) substantially injure consumers, either individually or in the aggregate. In Credit Card Lending Consultation #1, the bank allocated credit card payments on accounts with multiple-rate tiers first to balances with lower APRs, potentially resulting in the capitalization of unpaid interest to balances with higher APRs. While the harm (or likely harm) to one cardholder caused by this practice arguably may not have been substantial, when multiplied by all cardholders with rate-tiered ac-counts, such harm (or its likelihood) was determined to be substantial.
Here, a customer had his credit limit reduced after using a convenience check but before the check was presented for settlement. The customer first learned of the credit reduction in a letter from the bank dishonoring the check and advising him of the credit reduction. (In many cases, it is the bank's practice to honor the check, but in so doing, triggering unintended overdraft services and costs to the consumer.)
As a result of this practice, the customer's check bounced, causing a variety of harms to the customer. For instance, when the check was declined (because it would have caused the customer's credit limit to be exceeded), the customer still owed the debt that the check was originally written to cover. In addition, the customer may be liable for fees resulting from the check not being honored. For example, the payee may pass on the cost of the bounced check to the consumer and, depending on what the check was for, may assess a late fee against the consumer if the check was used to pay a bill that then became past due. Once the check is written, if there is a decrease in the credit line such that the bank will not cover the check, the harm to the bank's customer is unavoidable.
Banks should monitor their business practices to reduce the likelihood of harm to consumers, especially harm that consumers cannot reasonably avoid. In Credit Card Lending Consultation #2, customers of the bank were not reasonably able to avoid the harm caused by a bounced check drawn against a credit card account. Here, a check bounced solely because the bank, unbeknownst to the customer, reduced the customer's credit limit after the customer had already issued the check, but before the check was presented for settlement.
Banks should structure their practices to enable their customers to make informed decisions about the products and services they choose to purchase and use, and to operate under reasonably reliable expectations about any costs/consequences associated with those decisions.
To find an act or practice unfair, the injury caused by the act or practice must not be outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers or to competition.
In Credit Card Lending Consultation #3, as in Consultation #1, the bank offered a credit card account composed of multiple balances, each of which was subject to a different APR. 21 The bank allocated the required minimum credit card payments to this account in such a way as to credit a payment to the lower-rate balances first, potentially resulting in the capitalization of interest to the balances with the highest rates.
Although the consultants found this practice to be injurious to consumers (i.e., longer amortization periods and, thus, higher costs for the higher rate balances; see Credit Card Consultation #1), and the harm not reasonably avoidable, the consultants determined the injury was, in this instance, outweighed by the benefits in the form of low promotional rates for balance transfers and similar promotional rates (e.g., introductory low rates for new accounts). Determining whether this element of the unfairness test is met (i.e., whether an injury is outweighed by countervailing benefits) turns on the facts of each case; though the consultants in Credit Card Lending Consultation #3 found the injury outweighed by the benefits, a different finding may result from different facts. 22
Banks should closely examine, monitor, and test their business practices to confirm the benefits associated with those practices (be they related to a product or service), in their net effect, outweigh any harm resulting from such practices. For instance, while certain payment allocation practices in isolation may appear onerous and unfair, such practices, in their net effect, may benefit consumers and competition (e.g., the availability of low-rate balance transfers or other promotional rates). In addition, practices that do not result in a fair exchange of value between banks and their customers are likely contrary to best—and sustainable —business practices, as evidenced by current macroeconomic and financial events. 23
Public policy—as established by statute, regulation, or judicial decisions—may be considered in determining whether an act or practice is unfair under Section 5 of the FTC Act. For example, a credit card lending practice that violates a federal banking regulation may evidence an unfair act or practice. In Credit Card Lending Consultation #4, a bank failed to provide required finance charge disclosures under Regulation Z (Truth in Lending) yet charged finance charges to a consumer's account. The consultants cited the violation of Regulation Z as evidence of an unfair credit card lending practice.
The consequences of noncompliance with consumer protection laws and regulations are not limited to the statutory and regulatory penalties specific to those laws. In Credit Card Lending Consultation #4, a bank's violation of Regulation Z was found to evidence conduct contrary to public policy and, thus, was considered in analyzing unfairness under Section 5 of the FTC Act. Therefore, a comprehensive and effective compliance management program—one that avoids an overly myopic and, thus, constrained approach to compliance—will greatly benefit a bank in general, and in particular with respect to compliance with Section 5 of the FTC Act.
Meeting the standards for deception or unfairness depends on the specific facts and circumstances of each case. Judgment will always be a factor. The FDIC examination-consultation process assists FDIC staff responsible for exercising such judgment. Through the consultation process, not only are concerns relevant to a particular examination appropriately and comprehensively addressed, valuable lessons emerge that can assist in future examinations and serve as the basis for effective supervisory policy.

3 Survey of FTC Act, Section 5 consultations conducted between January 2007 and July 2008.
4 To ensure the highest degree of consistency and uniformity throughout the supervisory and enforcement functions of the agency, the FDIC maintains a consultative process applicable to several compliance examination matters, including Section 5 of the FTC Act. Depending on the issue, a ""consultation"" may be anything from a simple phone conversation or a series of e-mails to formal memoranda among field, regional, and Washington FDIC staff members. These communications are instrumental in maintaining the quality and consistency of compliance, fair lending, and Community Reinvestment Act examination and supervision. Consultations ensure that senior Division of Supervision and Consumer Protection officials are alerted to significant or unusual supervisory issues and that those issues receive appropriate and timely consideration. The examination consultation process also helps the FDIC develop more responsive and effective compliance policies and regulations. (Examiners see ""Division of Supervision and Consumer Protection Memorandum System, Class. No. 6456"" (May 7, 2004).)
5 See FIL-11-2005, ""Overdraft Protection Programs Joint Agency Guidance"" (February 18, 2005), id. Examiners also see DSC memoranda ""Examiner Guidance: Joint Guidance for Overdraft Protection Programs"" (April 18, 2005) and ""Deceptive Practices: Customer Access to Overdraft Protection"" (March 27, 2007).
6 For a list of some specific citable FTC Act violations, see Regulation AA (12 CFR 227), which specifically prohibits unfair credit contract provisions, unfair or deceptive cosigner practices, and unfair late charges.

18 Regulation AA specifically prohibits certain credit practices, such as the pyramiding of late fees.
19 Section 5; 15 U.S.C. 45(a).
20 However, substantial injury may involve other forms of harm. For instance, unwarranted health and safety risks may also support a finding of unfairness. For an example, see Philip Morris, Inc., 82 F.T.C. 16 (1973) (a consent agreement in which respondent had distributed free-sample razor blades in such a way that they could come into the hands of small children). And while emotional harm typically is not sufficient to find substantial injury, under certain circumstances (e.g., emotional harm caused by unfair debt collection practices), such harm could be sufficient to find substantial injury.
21 The circumstances in Credit Card Lending Consultation #1 are instructive for purposes of demonstrating the third prong of the unfairness standard and, therefore, are revisited and referenced here as Consultation #3.
22 The Federal Reserve Board (FRB) has proposed amendments to Regulation AA which, if adopted, would restrict the allocation of credit card payments in excess of the required minimum payment. The proposal provides that when different annual percentage rates (APRs) apply to different balances on a credit card account (for example, purchases and cash advances), banks would have to allocate payments exceeding the minimum payment using one of three methods or a method equally beneficial to consumers. They could not allocate the entire amount (i.e., the amount in excess of the required minimum payment) to the balance with the lowest rate. Under the proposal, a bank could, for example, split the amount equally between two balances. In addition, to enable consumers to receive the full benefit of discounted promotional rates (for example, on balance transfers) during the promotional period, payments in excess of the minimum would have to be allocated first to balances on which the rate is not discounted. The FRB has indicated it expects to issue a final rule by the end of 2008. However, as of the date of publication of this article, the FRB has not done so. When issued, the reader is urged to consult amended Regulation AA for UDAP guidance with respect to credit card payment allocation practices as well practices relating to time to make payments, application of an increased annual percentage rate to outstanding balances, fees for exceeding the credit limit caused by credit holds, security deposits and fees for the issuance or availability of credit, and use of unfair balance computation methods (as well as overdraft protection practices). In addition to Regulation AA, Regulation Z (Section 226), implementing the Truth in Lending Act (as recently amended by the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act Amendments of 2008), proscribes several specific mortgage lending acts and practices as unfair or deceptive, including certain servicing and advertising practices and the coercion of appraisers. In limited circumstances, Regulation Z also prohibits as unfair collateral-based lending, stated-income/asset-based lending, prepayment penalties, and not escrowing for taxes and insurance. All other practices must be judged by applying the FTC Act UDAP standards discussed in this article.

During 2010, legislators and regulators undertook a number of significant regulatory reforms in response to the financial crisis. One important theme of these reforms is the need for banking organizations to have stronger capital positions to weather periods of economic stress. This paper discusses one component of regulatory capital that was the subject of significant discussion, debate, and reform: trust preferred securities issued by bank holding companies.
The FDIC's Credit and Consumer Products/Services Survey was implemented in late 2009 to augment the collection of more traditional examination information. This Survey targets underwriting practices, new and evolving banking activities and products, local commercial real estate market conditions, funding practices, and consumer compliance issues. The authors summarize areas of particular interest to regulators and bankers from the analysis of recent survey results.
Senior life settlements (SLS), also known as death bonds, are increasingly being touted by Wall Street firms and financial advisers as a unique investment option. However, substantial financial risks, aggressive and deceptive sales practices driven by the possibility of high commissions, as well as the potential for fraud have resulted in heightened regulatory and legislative scrutiny of the SLS industry. SLS, in fact, have never received the supervisory approvals required to be deemed permissible bank investments. This article provides an overview of the development of the SLS market and identifies significant risks associated with these transactions to financial institutions, investors, and consumers.
The agricultural sector has continued to perform well during the recent economic downturn. However, the industry is cyclical and subject to substantial inherent volatility, and adherence to prudent and safe-and-sound banking practices will help ensure farm banks are well positioned to weather any challenges. This article identifies perennial hazards to the agricultural economy and highlights best practices related to agricultural lending and management of agricultural credit concentrations.
This feature provides an overview of recently released regulations and supervisory guidance.

""Prime"" Bank Instruments Spreading
Two scams are spreading across the United States and internationally: one playing on
the ambition to be debt free; and the other to receive a high rate of return on an
investment.
While the frauds should be obvious, they continue to trap unsuspecting bankers,
would-be investors and gullible consumers.
The first scheme involves ""certified money orders"" being sold by groups that dismiss
currency laws as unconstitutional. These bogus money orders are being sold to buyers
who are told they can be used to erase debt. A bank is instructed to mail the money
orders to an address, but is never paid. The number is growing, but an estimated 100 to
500 banks have already received the bogus money orders.
The second scheme involves ""prime"" bank financial instruments and has spread
around the world. Federal regulatory agencies have warned bankers to avoid
transactions involving these bogus ""prime"" bank financial instruments.
The articles below advise bankers on what to look for, and what to do.

Joint Statement on Crypto-Asset Risks to Banking Organizations
The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve), the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC)
(collectively, the agencies) are issuing the following statement on crypto-asset1 risks to banking
organizations.
The events of the past year have been marked by significant volatility and the exposure of
vulnerabilities in the crypto-asset sector. These events highlight a number of key risks associated
with crypto-assets and crypto-asset sector participants that banking organizations should be
aware of, including:
• Risk of fraud and scams among crypto-asset sector participants.
• Legal uncertainties related to custody practices, redemptions, and ownership rights, some of
which are currently the subject of legal processes and proceedings.
• Inaccurate or misleading representations and disclosures by crypto-asset companies,
including misrepresentations regarding federal deposit insurance, and other practices that
may be unfair, deceptive, or abusive, contributing to significant harm to retail and
institutional investors, customers, and counterparties.
• Significant volatility in crypto-asset markets, the effects of which include potential impacts
on deposit flows associated with crypto-asset companies.
• Susceptibility of stablecoins to run risk, creating potential deposit outflows for banking
organizations that hold stablecoin reserves.
• Contagion risk within the crypto-asset sector resulting from interconnections among certain
crypto-asset participants, including through opaque lending, investing, funding, service, and
operational arrangements. These interconnections may also present concentration risks for
banking organizations with exposures to the crypto-asset sector.
• Risk management and governance practices in the crypto-asset sector exhibiting a lack of
maturity and robustness.
• Heightened risks associated with open, public, and/or decentralized networks, or similar
systems, including, but not limited to, the lack of governance mechanisms establishing
oversight of the system; the absence of contracts or standards to clearly establish roles,
responsibilities, and liabilities; and vulnerabilities related to cyber-attacks, outages, lost or
trapped assets, and illicit finance.
It is important that risks related to the crypto-asset sector that cannot be mitigated or controlled
do not migrate to the banking system. The agencies are supervising banking organizations that
may be exposed to risks stemming from the crypto-asset sector and carefully reviewing any
1 By “crypto-asset,” the agencies refer generally to any digital asset implemented using cryptographic techniques.

proposals from banking organizations to engage in activities that involve crypto-assets. Through
the agencies’ case-by-case approaches to date, the agencies continue to build knowledge,
expertise, and understanding of the risks crypto-assets may pose to banking organizations, their
customers, and the broader U.S. financial system. Given the significant risks highlighted by
recent failures of several large crypto-asset companies, the agencies continue to take a careful
and cautious approach related to current or proposed crypto-asset-related activities and exposures
at each banking organization.
Banking organizations are neither prohibited nor discouraged from providing banking services to
customers of any specific class or type, as permitted by law or regulation. The agencies are
continuing to assess whether or how current and proposed crypto-asset-related activities by
banking organizations can be conducted in a manner that adequately addresses safety and
soundness, consumer protection, legal permissibility, and compliance with applicable laws and
regulations, including anti-money laundering and illicit finance statutes and rules. Based on the
agencies’ current understanding and experience to date, the agencies believe that issuing or
holding as principal crypto-assets that are issued, stored, or transferred on an open, public, and/or
decentralized network, or similar system is highly likely to be inconsistent with safe and sound
banking practices. Further, the agencies have significant safety and soundness concerns with
business models that are concentrated in crypto-asset-related activities or have concentrated
exposures to the crypto-asset sector.
The agencies will continue to closely monitor crypto-asset-related exposures of banking
organizations. As warranted, the agencies will issue additional statements related to engagement
by banking organizations in crypto-asset-related activities. The agencies also will continue to
engage and collaborate with other relevant authorities, as appropriate, on issues arising from
activities involving crypto-assets.
Each agency has developed processes2 whereby banking organizations engage in robust
supervisory discussions regarding proposed and existing crypto-asset-related activities.3 Banking
organizations should ensure that crypto-asset-related activities can be performed in a safe and
sound manner, are legally permissible, and comply with applicable laws and regulations,
including those designed to protect consumers (such as fair lending laws and prohibitions against
unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices). Banking organizations should ensure appropriate

3 Entities seeking to become regulated banking organizations will also be expected to adopt and demonstrate
appropriate risk management processes and controls to mitigate risks associated with planned activities, which
would include any crypto-asset-related activities, before receiving a charter or otherwise being authorized to

application.

Over the past several months, some crypto companies have suspended withdrawals or halted operations. In some cases, these companies have represented to their customers that their products are eligible for FDIC deposit insurance coverage, which may lead customers of these companies to believe, mistakenly, that their money or investments are safe. The FDIC is concerned that some customers of crypto companies, such as crypto custodians, exchanges, brokers, wallet providers, and neobanks may be confused about whether, and if so, how, they may be covered by FDIC deposit insurance. This Fact Sheet is intended to address some common misconceptions about the scope of deposit insurance coverage and whether deposit insurance applies to funds that customers provide to these crypto companies. The FDIC is providing the information below to assist the public in understanding FDIC deposit insurance coverage in light of recent market activity and media reports.

In July we recognize Military Consumer Month. During this month, we strive to increase awareness of financial readiness for servicemembers, veterans, and their families. Military Consumer Protection Day was first launched in 2013 by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) as a day to raise awareness about identity theft crimes that impact servicemembers. Since then, it has grown to a month-long campaign that is supported by numerous partners across the nation.
If you are planning programs for servicemembers this month, consider our Money Smart for Adults (MSA) curriculum . The MSA includes many different topics that can be helpful to servicemembers. From buying a home (module 13) to protecting your identity and other assets (module 11), there is something to enhance your financial literacy classes.
Our latest resource, How Money Smart Are You? offers multiple games on the same topics discussed in Money Smart for Adults .
We are eager to hear about your promising approaches and successful strategies involving Money Smart . Please share your story or tips about Money Smart at moneysmartnews@fdic.gov . Join us on social media using the #FDICMoneySmart and show us the Money Smart products in action!

Good news! All of the Participant Guides in English for our instructor-led version of MSA are now PDF-fillable. Participants can follow along on their phones or computers and fill in the questions and activities electronically, if they wish. The Apply It and Try It activities that involve math, now also perform the calculations automatically. Participants can focus on the content rather than the math. Our website always includes our most updated versions. You can find the PDF-fillable and math-enabled MSA Participant Guides in English at fdic.gov/msa-modules .

The July 2022 edition of the FDIC Consumer News focuses on aspects you should consider when sharing expenses, combining finances or buying a home with someone. Getting married? Or, perhaps moving in with a significant other? Regardless of your relationship, there are some financial aspects you should consider when sharing expenses. Read them here .

Proposed Interagency Guidance on Third-Party Relationships: Risk Management
Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the proposed interagency guidance on the management of
third-party relationships.
The National Community Reinvestment Coalition (NCRC) consists of more than 600 community-based
organizations, fighting for economic justice for almost 30 years. Our mission is to create opportunities for
people and communities to build and maintain wealth. NCRC members include community reinvestment
organizations, community development corporations, local and state government agencies, faith-based
institutions, fair housing, and civil rights groups, minority and women-owned business associations, and
housing counselors from across the nation. NCRC and its members work to create wealth-building
opportunities by eliminating discriminatory lending practices, which have historically contributed to
economic inequality.
NCRC urges the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation,
and the Federal Reserve (collectively, “the Agencies”) to apply a high degree of scrutiny to third-party
relationships. In instances where third-party relationships consist of agreements to originate loans at rates
greater than rates states permit non-banks to make, the Agencies should automatically deem them as
“high-risk."" Loans that exceed 36% APR, including fees, should be considered to be especially high-risk.
This letter emphasizes our concerns related to third-party relationships between banks and non-banks in
the context of providing deposit services, installment loans, lines of credit, and single-repayment loans.
We agree with the principle stated in the proposed update to the guidance that a banking organization's
use of third parties should not diminish its responsibility to operate safely and soundly and in compliance
with applicable laws.
Discussion
I. Because third-party relationships naturally create a wall between banks and their
customers, they undermine the ability of those banks to understand the needs and
conveniences of underserved consumers.
a. Although industry literature speaks with confidence, the claim that fintechs are enhancing
financial inclusion is unproven.
The most promising result found that in mortgage credit, non-bank lenders were at best less
discriminatory than traditional lenders but still charge borrowers of color more for purchase and refinance
loans.1 In non-mortgage consumer lending, while it is true that the use of algorithms and non-traditional
credit may lead to more loan approvals,2 traditional lenders and fintechs are both capable of using these
technologies. Notably, it is essential to differentiate between broad access to credit and safe and
affordable credit. Research suggests that online mortgage lenders charge higher rates of interest3 and are
more likely to originate refinances.4

b. Banks do not assess the needs and conveniences of the customers who use their third-
party products.
A significant challenge is that consumers are often not aware that they are using a bank when they receive
a loan or make a deposit with a fintech through a third-party relationship. For example, 813 of the 2,183
complaints filed to the CFPB for Enova include a consumer narrative. Not one contains a reference to
Republic Bank & Trust, even though Enova has a rent-a-bank scheme with Republic Bank & Trust in
about 20 states. The same absence is the case with the 75 complaints about Personify loans issued by First
Electronic Bank. 5 In each case, these banks have used their charter to help third parties provide high-cost
credit to consumers, but without a corresponding community reinvestment plan.
Similarly, the bank has not taken any role in finding customers and may not oversee marketing to prevent
targeting of struggling consumers and communities of color. While agreements stipulate that the banks
should review the marketing materials used by the third party to communicate with customers, the banks
do not acquire customers directly. Instead, the non-bank third parties create the materials, such as direct
mail and online pre-approved offers, and deploy their marketing budgets to pay for the cost of customer
acquisition. Ninety-two percent of Elevate Elastic line of credit borrowers responded to one of the
company’s prescreened credit offers. Elevate purchased those leads from credit bureaus.6 OppFi7 and
Elevate8 are examples of online non-bank lenders who use proprietary artificial intelligence to find
customers. Third-party lenders are more likely to respond only to motives of profit – they have no
obligation to meet community reinvestment needs.
c. Until the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) is updated to account for the disconnect
between the geographic reach of online fintechs and their branch networks, the business
activities performed by banks in third-party relationships will not be subject to
meaningfully commensurate community reinvestment obligations.
As third-party relationships usually govern activities that occur outside of the assessment area of the bank,
they exist outside of the realm of community reinvestment obligations.
A third-party relationship necessarily permits a bank to expand its business activity outside of its
assessment – not just outside of its home state – but potentially in all states.
Although an exception may exist, we are not aware of a case of an insured depository with a nationwide
branch network that engages in third-party relationships to make loans or take deposits. Almost always,
the opposite is true: a depository with an assessment area in one or a handful of MSAs uses a third-party
relationship with a program manager to offer bank accounts in many states.

In the category of digital bank accounts, a handful of small banks, usually with branches in a single
assessment area, have partnerships with non-bank program managers who serve consumers nationally.
For example, non-bank account program manager Chime now has twelve million active demand deposit
accounts through Stride Bank after its customer account grew fifty percent during the pandemic.9 Non-
bank program manager Current, whose demand deposit account is issued by New York-based
Metropolitan Commercial Bank, has enrolled three million consumers since its start in 2019.
These non-bank program managers conduct their business throughout the country, creating an
inconsistency between the customers they serve and where they are obligated to meet their community
reinvestment needs and conveniences. Some examples include the following:
• FinWise Bank has an assessment area in Salt Lake City, Utah but permits OppLoans and Elevate
to use its charter to make high-cost loans in several states. Through third-party relationships in its
Strategic Program division, FinWise facilitated $2.4 billion in loans in 2020.10
• First Electronic Bank, a Utah industrial loan company, has an assessment area in Salt Lake but
facilitates loans for Personify in 19 states.11
• Republic Bank & Trust has assessment areas in Kentucky, southwestern Ohio, western Florida,
and southeastern Tennessee12 but facilitates lines of credit for Elevate Credit in 22 states and Easy
Advance tax refund advances in all states. 13
The lending facilitated through these partnerships is not included in the banks’ CRA performance
evaluations (PEs). Republic's PE only covers its home mortgage and small business loans. The PE states,
""While the volume of loan originations by number through the Republic Processing Group is significant,
RBTC’s (Republic Bank & Trust Company) performance in extending loans in these areas was not
reviewed, as it operates strategically outside the traditional retail banking operations and largely offered
throughout the country (outside of the AAs).”14
Prudential regulators are not holding bank partners accountable for the misbehaviors of their demand
deposit account program managers. Earlier this year Chime began to close accounts without the
permission of account holders. Consumers filed complaints to the CFPB – not to the regulator of its
partner bank.15 No action against Stride Bank has been announced. When Chime referred to itself as a

In spite of existing guidance that placed responsibility on Stride Bank to monitor the actions of its partner,
it did not – and Stride Bank was not penalized.
II. The third-party relationships governing rent-a-bank schemes are high-risk
Third-party relationships between banks and non-bank lenders deserve to be highlighted explicitly as
""high-risk"" The amount of activity is sizeable, interest rates can be very high, and many of the loans are
not repaid. Non-bank lenders concentrate storefront payday loan stores in neighborhoods of color,18 and
are more likely to make high-cost internet payday loans to persons of color - 19 signaling that these
partnerships may pose fair lending issues. Lending is a risky area with numerous compliance issues, and
risks are high if the bank is not closely involved with all aspects of the loan program. These relationships
should be defined as ‘high-risk.”
a) When all loans made to consumers are considered in aggregate, banks engaged in rent-a-bank
schemes distribute significant sums of money, usually at high interest rates.
In the latest CRA performance evaluation for FinWise Bank, FDIC examiners estimated that FinWise
Bank facilitated 360,000 loans worth a total of $1.9 billion in 2019.20 Since then, FinWise has only
expanded its rent-a-bank lending. In its S-1 Registration Statement offered to investors before an initial
public offering of its stock, FinWise reported that it facilitated $2.4 billion in lending with third-party
non-bank lenders in 2020.21 Elevate uses FinWise Bank to originate Rise installment loans that can reach
149% APR.
OppFi, where interest rates may reach 160% APR, made $566 million in loans with bank partner FinWise
in the two years ending in December 2020 and additional loans when it signed partnership agreements
with two new partner banks during the latter half of 2020. During those years, 28.4 and 35.6 percent of
OppFi loans were charged off.
In the same year, Republic Bank & Trust’s Tax Refund Solutions division originated $95.7 million in
loans to tax preparation providers. At the end of September 2019, it held $252 million in loans made

through Republic Processing Group, its online third-party consumer lending division – constituting 5.2
percent of its total portfolio at that moment. 22
Republic Bank & Trust’s agreement with Elevate requires it to hold ten percent of originated Elastic lines
of credit (94 percent effective APR) on its balance sheet.23 At the end of the 3rd quarter of 2019, Republic
Credit Solutions had $99.15 million and $105.4 million in such loans on its balance sheet on September
30th, 201924 and December 31st, 2019,25 inferring that the ten percent of loan participations held by
Republic Bank & Trust as a part of its relationship with Elevate were a part of a moment-in-time portfolio
of more than $990 million. Moreover, because this is only a snapshot in time of loans that have a duration
of more than one month but no more than ten months,26 the annual sums of facilitated loans are likely to
be far more than $1 billion.
It is essential to clarify that bank partnerships do not uniformly facilitate high-cost lending. For example,
many platform lenders that use the partnership model have procedures in place that cap interest rates to
under 36 percent or below the applicable state interest rate cap, whichever is lower, and frequently at rates
that are lower than risk-based credit card rates.27
b) A high share of loans originated through bank partnerships are charged off – demonstrating that
rent-a-charter structures often ignore the ability of many borrowers to repay their loans despite
using a coercive repayment mechanism.
OppFi has three bank partners: FinWise Bank, First Electronic Bank, and Capital Community Bank. In
the first half of 2021, it used those partnerships to make approximately 86 percent of its originations.28 .
In 2019 and 2020, 42.2 percent and 35.6 percent of OppFi’s loans (as a percentage of average net
receivables) were charged off.29 This poor performance has happened even though OppFi is an online
lender that undoubtedly induces most of its borrowers to authorize automatic electronic repayment.

Elevate relies on FinWise Bank for its Rise installment loan product and Republic Bank & Trust for its
Elastic line of credit. Elevate does not report loan performance using charge-offs as a share of average
loan receivables. Nonetheless, in using an alternative metric, the high-risk nature of the lending is
revealed. In the last year, charge-off expenses were 52 and 41 percent of revenues for 2019 and 2020,
respectively. Charge-offs are the highest expense items at Elevate. The cost of lending and the frequency
of non-payment and defaults reflect the compromised nature of this lending -- a high-cost, high-default
model that does not rely on consumers’ ability to repay to be profitable. Echoing the similar nature of the
lending, but from a second vantage point, Republic Bank's annual report for 2019 indicates that it has
established a loan loss reserve allowance of 46 percent on the line of credit loans inside its Republic
Processing Group division.31 RPG is where it holds the loans it facilitates for Elevate Credit’s Elastic Line
of Credit product.
The charge-off rates demonstrate consumer harm and underscore our rationale for asking any future
guidances to designate high-cost (above 36 percent or state rate caps, whichever threshold is lower) loans
as “high-risk.” The proposed guidance (page 26) asks banks to consider whether a third-party ""has
identified, and articulated a process to mitigate, areas of potential consumer harm, particularly in which
the third-party will have direct contact with the bank's customers, develop customer-facing documents, or
provide new, complex, or unique products."" The relationships that facilitate the lending of the types
referenced above are inherently harmful to consumers. Similarly, the proposed guidance (page 36)
suggests that it might include benchmarks for risk management. If so, then the final guidance should have
benchmarks for consumer harms.
c) Safeguards to protect consumers from aggressive debt collectors should be strengthened. Some
third-party non-bank lenders outsource their debt collection services to other third parties.
Elevate, which services the loans it makes through its third-party relationships with FinWise Bank and
Republic Bank, outsources its collections and customer service to a third party.32 Enova uses bank
partners to make its loans and acknowledges that it uses third-party debt collectors to cure some of its
delinquencies.33
The Agencies should be skeptical about an agreement in which a non-bank third-party services loans
originated by a bank but then outsources some of its debt collection practices to a third-party debt
collection agency, as it suggests that the partner bank has little or no ability to exert influence over how
customers who receive its loans are treated. Suppose the non-bank partner has a contractual relationship

with a separate third party. In that case, the bank may have little or no ability to review and supervise the
debt collection policies of the debt collector.
d) The Agencies should prohibit bank partners from engaging in relationships with non-banks
where they do not have complete control over all consumer-facing activities, regardless of
whether the consumer-facing activities are the work of the non-bank partner or a contracted
party to the non-bank partner.
The guidance highlights that banks should be cautious about approving relationships where the third party
lacks negotiating power.
While existing regulations place an expectation on banks to control underwriting, marketing, and other
activities, the statements made by their non-bank lending partners underscore the inconsistency between
that operating assumption and the on-the-ground reality. Consider, for example, how OppFi explains its
business model to investors:
We are a leading financial technology platform that powers banks to offer
accessible lending products through its proprietary technology and artificial
intelligence (""AI"") and a top-rated experience…Our bank partners benefit from our
turnkey, outsourced marketing, data science, and proprietary technology to digitally
acquire, underwrite and service these everyday consumers.34
A turnkey service is just a service of such scope that there is minimal participation needed from the
partner. Each partnership between a bank and a fintech creates a new set of supervisory challenges, as
each fintech is likely to have a proprietary approach to analytics. The core value of many non-bank online
lenders is their analytics – they do not look to bank partners to provide those services, and they are
proprietary.
Moreover, regulators should view with skepticism the possibility that banks have the technological
sophistication to adequately monitor the building, training, and optimization of artificial intelligence and
machine learning systems. These systems are used in every step of the lending lifecycle, from marketing
to underwriting and through to collections. The non-bank partners control every aspect of model creation
and management, providing ""turnkey"" services and even the ""analytics-as-a-service"" systems used to
improve the explainability of the AI itself.35 The width (number of variables) and depth (number of
cases) in data sets utilized to build and train these systems are becoming so substantial that it strains
credulity to imagine that small banks can monitor the actions of their non-bank service partners. At the
point in time when Upstart’s model was operating under a no-action letter, its model had 1,600

variables.36 Enova’s decision engine includes over 100 algorithms and more than 1,000 variables.37 For
years, Elevate Credit has reported that its model has more than ten thousand variables.38
e) Banks must be sure that third-party non-bank partners do not violate the payment provisions in
the CFPB's 2017 final rule on payday, vehicle title, and certain high-cost installment loans (the
“payday rule”).
Under a court order issued in the Western District of Texas, the payment provisions in the 2017 final rule
have been upheld and will go into effect on June 13th, 2022.39
Online installment lenders generally use commercial banks to collect pre-authorized payments through
ACH networks. The payday rule prohibits payday lenders and installment and line-of-credit lenders where
loans bear interest rates of greater than 36% APR from debiting a bank account after two earlier attempts
have failed unless the lender has received reauthorization to do so from the borrower. Bank partners
should be required to report on how they verify that non-bank partners are complying with this provision.
f) These structures may undermine the reputation of partner banks.
The provision of high-cost credit seems destined to provoke negative public opinion, as there are
profound concerns held by many people and institutions about lending money at high interest rates. For
centuries, institutions have raised concerns about the lending of money at unreasonably high rates of
interest. The idea of usury – and the need to create laws to thwart it – reaches back to civilization's
formative stages.
g) They present risks associated with disparate impact and fair lending, including when lending is
targeted at struggling consumers by non-bank third parties using artificial intelligence and
machine learning.
Non-bank partners provide the analytics to identify customers, collect applications, and determine the
creditworthiness of potential borrowers.40 They design the marketing strategies and decide whom to
target.
Both the proposed guidance and prior Bulletins (e.g., OCC Bulletin 2020-10)41 states that banks should
conduct due diligence on the usage of alternative data for underwriting, fraud detection, loan pricing,

servicing, marketing, and other aspects of account management. However, both that Bulletin and the prior
Bulletin (2019-62) talked about the use of alternative data in a general context; the only empirical
example was related to the use of cash flow data. As a result, content is absent to address the issues
associated with the complexity and scope of alternative data used in online underwriting. As we noted
earlier, marketplace techniques routinely use more than one thousand variables in an underwriting
decision. These models break from traditional credit scoring in significant ways – for example, they are
non-linear, rely on decision trees and dynamic variables, and are constantly in flux.
As a result, while the guidance’s themes of bank accountability and rigorous assessment sound
convincing, we think the proposal should be more skeptical of the ability of bank partners to supervise the
AI and ML techniques being deployed in the marketplace.
It is also not clear that the banks will engage in rigorous fair lending testing of the lending program's
marketing, underwriting, and other aspects. One non-bank lender says that it provides underwriting
(“decision management platform as a service”) and marketing services as well as analytics to optimize
models and test for their explainability (“analytics as a service”)42 – suggesting that its bank partners no
longer perform the functions required in existing guidance.
In describing its analytics, Elevate Credit provides evidence to support the view that managing a third
party is not simple. In its most recent annual report, Elevate states:
We have made substantial investments in our proven technology and analytics platforms to
support rapid scaling and innovation, robust regulatory compliance, and ongoing
improvements in underwriting. Our proven technology platform provides for nimble
testing and optimization of our user interface and underwriting strategies, highly automated
loan originations, cost-effective servicing, and robust compliance oversight. Our
proprietary risk analytics infrastructure utilizes a massive (approximately 80+ terabytes)
Hadoop database composed of more than ten thousand potential data variables related to
each of the customers we have served. We are in the process of migrating our data stack to
Snowflake, a next-generation cloud-based platform, which will provide us with improved
scalability, reliability, and performance benefits to support our future growth. Our team of
data scientists uses our proprietary technology to build and test scores and strategies across
the entire underwriting process, including segmented credit scores, fraud scores,
affordability scores, and former customer scores. We also use a variety of analytical
techniques from traditional multivariate regression to machine learning and artificial
intelligence to continue to enhance our underwriting accuracy while complying with
applicable lending laws and regulations. As a result of our proprietary technology and risk
analytics, more than 95% of loan applications are automatically decisioned in seconds with
no manual review required.43

Elevate’s analytics platform epitomizes the challenges that AI and ML create. The amount of information
is vast, decision-making is not linear, weights are dynamic, and models change over time. To make it
more difficult, decisions occur in seconds and without human review.
The guidance should state how bank partners will be held accountable to verify that these models are not
biased against protected classes, that the models have been optimized not just for accuracy but also
fairness, and that adverse action notices describe the reasons that resulted in an adverse decision. For
example, the guidance could instruct banks on suitable pre and post-hoc methods for monitoring the
systems used by their third-party relationships and standards for training methods and appropriate
demographic makeups of training data sets.
The guidance should state how bank partners will be held accountable to verify that these models are not

example, the guidance could instruct banks on suitable pre and post-hoc methods for monitoring the
systems used by their third-party relationships and standards for training methods and appropriate
demographic makeups of training data sets.
h) The guidance should state that models that are not explainable have heightened risks for
discriminatory impacts.
Increasingly, third-party relationships involving lending are made through digital channels (online and
mobile). The emerging models rely heavily on artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to
provide instantaneous underwriting decisions and incorporate many variables, including alternative data.
The guidance should include expectations for ensuring that decisions are explainable.
The Agencies should develop transparent systems for monitoring the use of algorithmic tools. Necessary
steps include: Requiring lenders to use explainable models or to use explainability techniques that can
accurately describe the reasons for a decision made by an AI model. The Agencies should staff and invest
in testing models for explainability, including tests for explainability among different demographic
groups.
• To fulfill the purpose of adverse-action notices, the CFPB should reconsider the content and form
of adverse-action notices. The Agencies should require lenders only to use data elements that
would give turned-down applicants the agency to improve their creditworthiness.
• The Agencies should address how consumers can resolve instances where lenders used incorrect
data to evaluate applicants for creditworthiness.
• The Agencies should supervise and take enforcement action where lenders cannot demonstrate
they have effectively performed disparate impact analysis of their use of AI and alternative data,
including that provided by third parties. The Agencies should clarify that all financial institutions
are accountable for ensuring a robust CMS that includes rigorous evaluations of their use of AI
and alternative data.
i) Relationships that permit data aggregators to access customer information should be defined as a
business arrangement, regardless of how it obtains the information.
Many banks have agreements with data aggregators. With the permission of a consumer, these companies
can gain access to a consumer’s bank account. Data aggregators may use automated programming
interfaces (APIs) or screen scraping to access account information. Screen scraping is an older
technology, more susceptible to cyberattacks, and does not permit a consumer to place conditions on how
his or her data is utilized.44
The proposed guidance would assign the “business arrangement” standard to contracts that permit a data
aggregator to access consumer information through an API, but not when the information is obtained by
screen scraping. The inconsistency creates a gap in consumer protection and has the counterintuitive
effect of applying a lighter regulatory standard to a riskier technology. Screen scraping does not permit a
consumer to apply gradations of permission. Moreover, the consumer is unlikely to perceive the
difference when authorization is granted for screen scraping versus a system that uses an API. The
guidance would not define screen scraping as grounds for a business arrangement but would only state
that banks should “engage in appropriate risk management.”
j. The guidance fails to alert banks to the risk that preemption authority may not apply, and the loan
program may be found to be unlawful when it enables the issuance of credit at rates that exceed state
laws.
Rent-a-charter relies on preemption power and undermines rate caps passed by states for payday and
consumer installment lending. These partnerships have the effect of transferring preemption power to
non-banks.
Rent-a-bank relationships exist to permit a non-bank high-cost lender to tap the preemptive immunity for
a national bank or federal savings association from state usury laws (12 USC 85 or 1463 (g)). A lengthy
litigation record exists to demonstrate that online lenders use bank partnerships to evade state laws and
that states resent these evasions. The legal landscape is fluid, and banks that rent out their charters to non-
bank entities run the risk that the lending programs will be deemed subject to state law and that the banks
could be conspirators to usury evasions. The greater the disparity between a loan's interest rate and the
legal state rate, and the more significant the role of the non-bank entity in designing, operating, and
profiting from the loan program, the greater the likelihood that it will be viewed not as a bank lending
program but as an unlawful evasion of state usury laws.
For example, the Attorney General of the District of Columbia filed a lawsuit against Elevate Credit for
violating the District's Consumer Protection Procedures Act when it issued installment loans and lines of
credit at interest rates of greater than 99 percent.45 The complaint concerned loans issued through bank
partnerships with FinWise Bank and Republic Bank & Trust. In remanding the case from federal to DC
court, a federal court found that the AG’s allegations are similar enough to older rent-a-bank schemes for
the court to conclude that “the District has sufficiently alleged that Elevate is the true lender of the Rise
and Elastic loans.”46

46 Distr. of Columbia v. Elevate, 2021 WL 2982143 at *9 (DDC July 15th, 2021).
III. Loans originated with interest rates of greater than 36 percent are especially high-risk and
should be discouraged whether made directly or through a non-bank.
a) The guidance should state that there is a heightened risk of violating the Military Lending Act
(MLA) when loans are over 36%, especially when originated online through a third-party
relationship.
Lenders are prohibited from extending credit to service members and their families at rates that exceed 36
percent as calculated under the MLA. Any lending program above 36% runs the risk of violating the
MLA.
b) Heightened risk of providing national support for predatory lending, leading to consumer harm.
When federal banking regulators permit national banks to originate high-cost credit, they encourage
lending that is predatory, harmful to struggling consumers, and highly unpopular.
In poll after poll, the public has expressed its opposition to predatory lending,47 48a preference for lower-
cost small-dollar bank products as opposed to non-bank payday loans,49 and support for a 36 percent
annual interest rate cap on payday and consumer installment loans.50
By offering guidance on third-party lending without highlighting the risks of high-cost lending, especially
lending that exceeds state interest rate caps, new guidance could be interpreted to permit predatory
lending.
Conclusion
We applaud the Agencies for focusing on the critical questions of risk management of third-party
relationships. Our comment calls attention to the particular problems posed by the subset of relationships
that concern lending between banks and high-cost non-bank lenders.
We are concerned that the guidance does not include specific conditions associated with them, as they
impact consumers, are achieving scale in the marketplace, and pose risks to harm consumers. They
represent an example of innovation that may lead to financial inclusion of the wrong kind – giving
consumers access to credit that they may not have the ability to repay.
Because third-party relationships naturally create a wall between banks and their customers, it undermines
the ability of those banks to understand the needs and conveniences of underserved consumers.

When cybersecurity is inadequate, it can lead to stolen identity and financial loss. Most scams and scammers have two main goals--to steal your money and your identity. You should know what to look for, how they work, and what to do, so you can protect yourself and your finances.
Maintaining cybersecurity is very important, even for consumers. It is not simply something that concerns large corporations and other businesses. Here are some steps you can take:
Here are some trending scams to look out for:
Money Mules
Scammers use people as “money mules” to receive or move money obtained from victims of fraudulent activities. Scammers proactively recruit people to be part of fraudulent activity without their knowing it. If a stranger asks you to open a bank account, or asks for access to your bank account or debit card, be extremely guarded. A scammer may ask you to move money and direct you to deposit funds into your bank account, or ask you to purchase virtual currency or gift cards for someone else’s benefit. In these scenarios, you may be unknowingly hiding someone else’s money for them. Be very cautious if a stranger asks you to receive or forward packages containing money or goods, which may also be part of a similar fraudulent scheme.
If you believe you have engaged in, or contributed to, money mule activities, stop transferring money or merchandise, and stop communicating with the person giving you direction. Then, immediately report your concern to your bank. Your banker can assist you with the appropriate steps toward protecting your bank account and money. You should also report the suspected activity to law enforcement. Visit the U.S. Department of Justice webpage on money mules for more information.
Online Dating
Romance scammers, as they are often called, create fake profiles and try to develop relationships with their targeted victims through online dating apps or social networking websites. Once the relationship develops and they have earned your trust, the scammer makes up a story and asks for your money. Be aware that scammers are lurking in these areas, so you can keep yourself and your money safe. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has additional information on romance scams .
Impostors
Impostor scams are when a scammer pretends to be someone you know or trust to convince you to send them money. They may even claim they are with the FDIC or another government agency. These scams are communicated through emails, phone calls, letters, text messages, faxes, and social media. The messages might ask you to “confirm” or “update” confidential personal financial information, such as bank account numbers. In other cases, the communication might be an offer to help victims of current or previous frauds with an investigation or to recover losses. Some scams request that you file official looking forms, such as insurance claims, or pay taxes on prize winnings. They might claim that you have an unpaid debt and threaten you with a lawsuit or arrest if you don’t pay. Other recent examples include check endorsements, bankruptcy claimant verification forms, stock confirmations, and investment purchases.
The FDIC or other government agencies do not send unsolicited correspondence asking for money or sensitive personal information, and we will never threaten you, or demand that you pay by gift card, wiring money, or digital currency. FDIC Consumer News: Scammers Pretending to be the FDIC has more information on impostor scams.
Mortgage and Foreclosure Scams
Watch out for scammers who falsely claim to be lenders, loan servicers, financial counselors, or representatives of government agencies who can help with your mortgage. These criminals prey on vulnerable, desperate homeowners. For more on mortgage scams and how to protect yourself, visit the FTC Mortgage Relief Scams .
Foreclosure scams usually come from multiple advertisements stating that a company wants to save you from foreclosure. This scam allows fraudsters to take the equity out of your home. They may even try to evict you from your home and sell it. Learn more at Common Foreclosure Rescue and Loan Modification Scams under the FDIC Consumer Assistance Topics.
Ransomware
One cyber threat often discussed in the news is ransomware. Typically, this scam targets businesses, not individuals. Ransomware is a type of malware created to lock or encrypt files on an electronic device like a smart phone or computer.

Introductory Remarks
Chairman McWilliams welcomed members to the Committee’s
second virtual meeting, noting that much had happened in the
months since the Committee last met, and that the FDIC is
working hard to ensure community banks can continue the business
October 28, 2020
586
of banking amidst dire pandemic circumstances and unprecedented
business closures. She welcomed new Committee member Stephen
Hayes, Chairman and President of Dakota Prairie Bank, Fort
Pierre, South Dakota, then introduced Mr. Davis as moderator.
Mr. Davis invited opening comment from Director Gruenberg,
who thanked members for their participation, and said he looked
forward to hearing their current experiences and their outlook
on the upcoming months.
Community Banking Conditions
Mr. Davis then introduced a roundtable discussion of
community banking conditions. The Committee members discussed a
range of trends and issues related to local banking environments
and conditions, including the following:
COVID-19 Pandemic. The pandemic and its economic and
banking consequences permeated the members’ discussion. Those
from areas with significant COVID-19 case numbers early in the
pandemic generally reported improvement in conditions over the
summer, while some members from rural areas less affected by the
late winter and spring outbreaks described increasing spikes.
All members indicated concern about the prospects of rising
cases with winter’s arrival, and with it the potential for
economically consequential responses. Within that uniformity,
members described a variety of local conditions and operational
responses.
Although all members indicated that some modifications to
operations were in place to protect their employees and the
public, the actual practices ranged from continuing branch or
lobby closures to business-as-usual (with masks) in the front
office and expanded telework behind the scenes. Many stated
their institutions increasingly relied on “non-contact channels”
such as online and telephone banking. Those members reporting
COVID-19 infections among staff expressed a belief that their
operational response had precluded spread within their offices,
with several stressing the importance of protecting customer and
staff alike. Two members recounted positive experience with
remote examinations necessitated by the pandemic: Member DeBiasi
stated his hopes that this experience leads to a “paradigm
October 28, 2020
587
shift” in the manner of conducting examinations of smaller
institutions, while Member Maley noted the continuing importance
of face-to-face contact during this process.
Committee members also noted that the pandemic highlighted
the importance of community banking. Member Shettlesworth
echoed Chairman McWilliams’s prior public statement that
community banks hit “above their weight” in delivering stimulus
to their communities during the crisis, noting that the
institution in his state with the most deposits did not make a
single Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan in-state. Member
Epstein expressed a belief that the community bankers’ customer
knowledge enabled prudent exercise of flexibility in managing
the credit needs of borrowers impacted by the crisis. Member
Maley noted a sense that, unlike prior financial crises, “banks
were friends, not foes” providing aid to communities through
extensions of PPP loans and Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and
Economic Security (CARES) Act funds, as well as by sharing rate
reductions with customers.
Most members who reported involvement in PPP described
their experience with the forgiveness program, noting some
difficulties and surprise at the requirement to deduct Economic
Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) advances from the forgiveness amount
– resulting in an unexpected need to carry a balance on the loan
after forgiveness. Member Mongold commented favorably on the
recent Interim Final Rule providing temporary relief from Part
363 Audit and Reporting requirements for banks that have
experienced temporary growth due to participation in the PPP and
other stimulus programs.
Member Leavitt and Member Kelly said that their
institutions had resumed action on long-term strategic
initiatives paused earlier in the pandemic. Still, no member
indicated that the end of the pandemic is in sight. Subsequent
sections of these minutes address the variety of continuing
effects of and responses to the pandemic, which the members
expect to continue until an effective vaccine or therapeutic
treatment is widely available.
Economic Conditions. Members reported significant economic
improvement since the July 2020 meeting. Most said that the
October 28, 2020
588
robust employment recovery continued in their communities,
though Member Leavitt noted that many job seekers had “opted
out” of the labor market, and Member Epstein expressed concern
that anticipated pandemic closings would lead to increases in
unemployment. Nearly all members described robust single-family
housing market conditions, with high demand for construction,
expansion, purchase, and refinance loans. This demand, members
said, was attributed to low rates and strong price appreciation
due to limited inventory – itself a result of increased purchase
interest and high construction labor and materials costs.
Members Edwards and Walker spoke of home buying in exurban and
rural areas being driven by workers exploring telework as a
result of the pandemic, while Member Kimbell posited that the
draw of “country living” explained increased demand in his
region. Member Andersen said that her institution purchased a
mortgage company to expand its reach in this market, while
Member Epstein said his bank invested in an improved online
platform to compete with nonbank mortgage lenders. According to
the members, agriculture is also performing above expectations
in 2020, thanks to direct support programs and improved growing
conditions over 2019. Member Kimbell said that farming “is on
top of its game” and that this buoys all sectors in some rural
areas. Member Walker noted the strength of the education and
healthcare sectors.
Members identified difficulties in other sectors, notably
hospitality and commercial real estate. Most members reported
that the hospitality industry in their markets continued to
suffer from pandemic-driven reductions in demand. Some members
observed that summertime recovery was now at risk due to the
return of indoor weather and the threat of shutdowns aimed at
controlling COVID-19 infections. Member Narvaez said that
border crossing restrictions in his location had heavily
affected hospitality businesses. The transition to telework
raises long-term questions about demand for office space,
according to Members Getzlaff and Andersen. Other impacted
industries include the nonprofit sector, with Member Pitkin
noting that the survival of many nonprofits may hinge on
additional stimulus.
Many members attributed the overall positive economic
conditions to federal and state stimulus programs. Members
October 28, 2020
589
indicated that doubts as to further stimulus programs, just like
doubts about the course of the pandemic itself, give rise to
overall uncertainty about 2021, a year that Member DeBiasi
described as a “wildcard.”
Banking Conditions. Across the board, members reported
strong banking conditions prevailing in their institutions and
local markets. Member Shettlesworth expressed a shared
sentiment of surprise, noting that his bank will end the year
with record earnings and loan and customer growth, which
“doesn’t make sense” given the challenges posed by the pandemic
and recession.
Nearly all members reported strong asset quality, with few
borrowers continuing to use the deferrals, extensions, and other
forbearance extended earlier in the year. Member Edwards said
that past-due loans were at “unbelievably” low levels even
without considering the pandemic. Members Leavitt and Epstein
praised the conscientiousness and fortitude of borrowers in
keeping loans current despite 2020’s challenges. Members also
reported asset growth, with a fraction attributed to stimulus
programs but with organic growth noted as well. Member Kelly
observed that asset quality is strong, but qualified this as a
“short run” observation, and that his institution was increasing
its allowances for loan losses – something reported by roughly
half of the members.
Members continued to report significant deposit growth,
attributing much of it to the stimulus programs as well as to
traditional asset-growth strategies, such as branch openings.
Members told of a variety of strategies to address the capital
implications of asset and deposit growth. Member Maley described
a successful capital raise, and Member Shettlesworth said his
institution was considering one.
Several members noted record years for earnings, with some
pointing to mortgage origination and sales as a “bright spot”
for community banks. Members identified net interest margin
compression, reduced interchange fees due to recession-related
decreases in spending, and the earnings effects of increasing
reserves as challenges to earnings. Some members expressed
caution about earnings prospects for 2021.
October 28, 2020
590
Diversity and Inclusion. Several members complimented the
FDIC’s efforts, and Chairman McWilliams’s leadership, on
diversity and inclusion in 2020. Member Kelly noted that in “a
capitalist society, economics are the measuring stick” and that
2020 provides an opportunity to be equitable. To this end, he
called attention to the National Bankers Association’s
priorities of equity investments, revenue-generating business
opportunities, and deposits. Member Leavitt mentioned the
FDIC’s recent publication, “Investing in the Future of Mission
Driven Banks” and his institution’s support for a Vermont
community development financial institution, as well as its own
“Equity Framework.”
Other Topics. Members mentioned competition with nonbank
lenders, with Member Hayes noting that recent revisions to
agricultural appraisal requirements helped level the playing
field with nonbank agricultural lenders. Member Maley urged a
reconsideration of FDIC treatment of “Amish Aid” flood
insurance, saying that discrepancies in regulatory approach
advantage national banks over FDIC-supervised institutions.
Member Epstein recounted recent experience with cyber-attacks in
his area, noting the success of his institution’s response plans
and his initiation of further training and testing to prevent
social engineering attacks. Member Pitkin discussed the
importance of vigilance against fraud, especially in the area of
unemployment insurance claims. Member Hayes told of a
successful emerging leaders program at his institution, designed
to train newer workers and involve them in succession planning.
Finally, Member Getzlaff recounted her involvement in a recent
small business panel convened by the Consumer Protection
Financial Bureau as part of its rulemaking to implement Section
1071 of the Do -Frank Act. Member Getzlaff explained some of
dd
the issues explored by the panel relating to data collections
regarding applications for credit by women-owned and minority-
owned businesses. She advocated for a $10 billion institution
size threshold for loan-level data collection requirements to
avoid unintended impacts on borrowers and undue burdens on
smaller institutions.
After the committee member roundtable, Mr. Davis introduced
FDIC staff members to discuss their national and regional
October 28, 2020
591
observations. Shayna Olesiuk, Associate Director, National and
Regional Risk Analysis, Division of Insurance and Research
(DIR), presented on the national economy and banking trends.
John Conneely, Regional Director, Chicago region, and Kathy Moe,
Regional Director, San Francisco region, presented observations
from local FDIC staff.
Following this discussion, Mr. Davis announced the meeting
would briefly recess. Accordingly, the meeting stood in recess
at 3:13 p.m.
Update from the Minority Depository Institutions Subcommittee
The Committee reconvened at 3:22 pm. Mr. Davis introduced
Member Narvaez and Ms. Rudolph, National Director, Minority and
Community Development Banking, RMS, to present an update on the
Minority Depository Institutions (MDI) Subcommittee, which had
met the day before.
Following the presentation, Member Kelly provided feedback
about the request for proposal (RFP) for financial advisors to
support the new Mission Driven Bank Fund. He expressed concern
about the RFP creating exclusion based on experience. By way of
example, he said that if an RFP has a magnitude of $2 billion,
but no minority firm reaches that threshold, the RFP should
include some provision for inclusion. In addition, he suggested
that minority organizations have a representative in the process
of standing up the fund. He expressed his willingness to work
with the MDI Subcommittee to ensure the process is inclusive.
Ms. Rudolph thanked him for those suggestions, and she
shared that the MDI Subcommittee had discussed the importance of
ensuring the fund investment committee understands the MDI and
CDFI bank sector, which is different from mainstream banking.
She added that the FDIC solicited minority and women-owned law
firms to assist in drafting fund documents and helping with the
RFP. She noted that the FDIC is focused on ensuring diversity
of participation.
October 28, 2020
592
Proposed Changes to the Supervisory Appeals Process
Mr. Davis next introduced Samuel Lutz and James Watts, both
Counsel in the Legal Division’s Assessment Unit, who presented
on proposed changes to the supervisory appeals process.
Following their presentations, Members Hayes and Edwards
asked whether the FDIC had considered adding a banker to the
proposed Office of Supervisory Appeals to enhance its
independence. Mr. Watts responded that the FDIC had received
similar comments in writing as well as in listening sessions and
webinars and will consider these comments as the proposal is
finalized. Member Edwards added that new office should be
diverse and include others besides bankers.
Supervision Update
Mr. Davis then introduced a panel of RMS representatives to
provide updates on supervisory matters. Doreen Eberley,
Director, RMS, outlined the topics to be discussed.
Next, John Rieger, Chief Accountant, RMS, discussed
Financial Institution Letter (FIL) 74-2020 issued on August 3,
2020, which provides direction on prudent risk management and
consumer protection principles for financial institutions to
work with borrowers as loans near the end of their initial
accommodation period.
Then Shannon Beattie, Deputy Chief Accountant, highlighted
differences between Section 4013 of the CARES Act and
discussions in the Interagency Statements of April 7 and August
3, 2020 regarding loan modifications related to COVID-19.
Mr. Rieger then discussed an interim final rule the Board
approved on October 20 that provides certain relief under Part
363 regarding audits, financial reporting, internal controls,
and the makeup of Boards.
Ms. Beattie then concluded the panel’s presentation by
discussing the Call Reports for March 31, 2020 and June 30,
2020. She noted that those Call Reports contained revisions
associated with several capital-related and other interim final
October 28, 2020
593
rules and a final rule issued in response to COVID-19’s impact
on financial markets and strain on the U.S. economy. Ms.
Beattie added that institutions should refer to the separate
stand-alone September 2020 COVID-19 Related Supplemental
Instructions, which address these revisions.
Following these presentations, Member Walker asked whether
the FDIC had considered adjusting the CRA thresholds due to the
unusual growth in assets. Ms. Eberley responded that the FDIC
is looking at other thresholds and factors that might have been
affected, as noted in the background section of the Federal
Register notice relating to the recent Part 363 interim final
rule (as announced in FIL-99-2020).
Member Hayes then requested clarification on the evaluation
process regarding Threshold Adjustments Due to Unusual Asset
Growth mentioned in the presentation. Ms. Eberley responded
that it related to the foregoing discussion of how the FDIC is
evaluating regulatory thresholds in light of balance sheet
increases, and made one adjustment while continuing to review
others.
Next, Member Epstein suggested, as a topic for future
consideration, the challenges banks will encounter in evaluating
extensions of commercial credit as a result of the pandemic
impact on cash flow or debt service coverage for 2020. He
suggested considering these measures over a multi-year period,
or substituting a pro forma statement for 2020 figures. Ms.
Eberley responded by referencing the examiner guidance and
instructions issued in June, which advises examiners to be
cognizant of difficulties with financial statements and the
potential use of pro forma financial statements due to
continuing uncertainty or disruption. Ms. Miller added that
examiners are instructed to look at the risk assessment process,
and she expressed a willingness to discuss the topic at the next
meeting.
October 28, 2020
594
Rapid Prototyping Competition and Request for Information on
Proposed Voluntary Certification Program to Promote New
Technologies
Mr. Davis then introduced Brandon Milhorn, Deputy to the
Chairman and Chief of Staff, who presented an update from
FDiTech on the Rapid Prototyping Competition and Request for
Information on Proposed Voluntary Certification Program to
Promote New Technologies. Member Epstein expressed support for
the initiative.
Update from the U.S. Small Business Administration
Mr. Davis then introduced staff from the U.S. Office of
Small Business Administration (SBA) – William Briggs, Deputy
Associate Administrator, Office of Capital Access; Dianna
Seaborn, Director, Office of Financial Assistance; and Susan
Streich, Director, Office of Credit Risk Management – to discuss
issues relating to forgiveness of PPP loans.
Ms. Seaborn noted the National Association of Government
Guaranteed Lenders national conference was occurring that week,
and the SBA had been hearing more about issues regarding PPP
loan forgiveness. She added that the SBA recently issued
information on change of ownership rules for business owners who
received PPP funds.
Mr. Briggs reported that the SBA released its FY-20 data
that day. Combining PPP, EIDL, and the SBA’s regular loan
program, the SBA had issued nearly nine million loans and over
$750 billion worth of financial assistance for small businesses
this year – a record in the agency’s history.
Member Shettlesworth asked about the SBA’s timeline for
responding to forgiveness applications, and whether the SBA can
send forgiveness notices to lenders who communicate directly
with the borrowers.
Mr. Briggs began by reminding the Committee that the
borrowers apply to the lenders for forgiveness, and the lenders
then send the forgiveness decisions to the SBA. He noted that
the SBA has not yet received the vast majority of forgiveness
October 28, 2020
595
decisions from lenders. Mr. Briggs added that the SBA has begun
remitting payments to lenders who submitted forgiveness
applications, and he expects that pace to pick up. He stated
that since the remittance payment is the point at which taxpayer
funds are exposed, the SBA has been working with its Inspector
General as well as the U.S. Government Accountability Office
(GAO) and congressional committees on implementation of the PPP.
He expressed willingness to look into how forgiveness notices
are distributed. Ms. Seaborn noted that they will evaluate
whether they can provide access to the portal to more staff
members at each lender. She added that direct receipt of
forgiveness notices is facilitated by lenders’ signing up in the
portal, and ensuring they enter correct ACH information.
Member Shettlesworth next asked about potential tax
consequences of PPP loan forgiveness. Mr. Briggs and Ms.
Seaborn provided general responses regarding federal and state
tax consequences, with Ms. Seaborn advising that the SBA is in
discussion with the IRS about CARES Act tax exemptions.
Next, Member Walker asked the SBA’s timeline for responding
to borrowers after banks submit requested items for forgiveness
applications. Mr. Briggs responded that the SBA does not have a
specific timeframe, but tries to handle applications
expeditiously.
Member Mongold then asked about unexpected reductions of
forgiveness by EIDL advances. Mr. Briggs emphasized that
Section 1110 of the CARES Act requires EIDL advance deduction
from the forgiveness amount. He said the SBA is aware of this
issue, but it would require a statutory remedy. He noted that
EIDL advances are shown in the portal.
Next, Member Leavitt asked how to ensure the SBA does not
subtract the EIDL advance amount again during the forgiveness
process, in the event a borrower already subtracted it. Mr.
Briggs responded that the SBA is looking into that with the
Department of Treasury. He advised that, since the SBA will
deduct the EIDL amount, if a borrower already deducted the EIDL
advance amount, the lender should wait to apply for the
forgiveness decision as the SBA and Treasury work to resolve the
problem.
October 28, 2020
596
Member Shettlesworth then asked what documentation the SBA
wants lenders to send with forgiveness applications under Form
3508S for smaller loans. Mr. Briggs said that supporting
documentation is required regardless which form is used. Ms.
Seaborn added that the SBA does not expect a level of
confirmation involving external review, but does expect that a
lender would not move a forgiveness application forward if they
believe, in good conscience, that there is an issue.
Division of Insurance and Research Update
Mr. Davis then introduced a panel from DIR: Angela Hinton,
Senior Financial Analyst; Daniel Hoople, Financial Economist;
and Jonathan Pogach, Chief, Financial Modeling & Research
Section. They discussed deposit trends, the Deposit Insurance
Fund, and the FDIC's Academic Challenge.
Ms. Hinton highlighted the unprecedented deposit growth
reported in the first half of 2020. She presented statistics
for the industry as a whole, and for all FDIC-insured
institutions, and detailed the impact of that deposit growth on
the FDIC's reserve ratio.
Next, Mr. Hoople discussed the restoration plan adopted by
the FDIC Board in September, including the necessity for the
plan, its components, and underlying analysis.
Following the presentations, Member Shettlesworth asked
about the possibility of the FDIC increasing deposit insurance
assessments to raise the DIF ratio. He questioned whether, in
those circumstances, the increased assessments would apply
across the industry, or focus on larger institutions. Mr.
Hoople responded by noting that the FDIC’s desire to avoid
overburdening the banking system at this time is evidenced by
its recent decision to maintain assessment rates, but described
scenarios in which increased assessments could become necessary
and related considerations.
Finally, Mr. Pogach presented on the 2020-2021 Academic
Challenge, a nationwide undergraduate competition.
October 28, 2020
597
Closing Remarks
Mr. Davis invited closing comments from Director Gruenberg,
who thanked the Committee Members for their participation in the
lengthy virtual meeting and useful discussion. He reiterated
that the Committee has been a valuable asset to the FDIC over
the years, providing a line of sight into what community banks
experience at the local level, and that their presentations
reflect the value and commitment community banks offer to their
communities.
Chairman McWilliams closed the meeting by thanking the
Committee members and presenters for the feedback and
interesting data points to consider on regulatory and
supervisory fronts. She expressed her gratitude for the members
whose Committee terms end this year: Members DeBiasi, Edwards,
Epstein, Kimbell, Leavitt, Maley, Shettlesworth, and Walker.
Having no further business to discuss, the meeting
adjourned at 5:38 p.m.

It’s easier than ever to handle our finances without setting foot inside a bank with so many advances in technology, but these changes have also made fraud and financial abuse a prevalent problem for older adults. Most elder financial abuse involves scams, forgery, identity theft, or undue pressure to give someone access to property or funds by simply providing information over the phone. Older adults are often targeted for such exploitation because they may be perceived as trusting, they may be cognitively impaired, they may have more funds available after a lifetime of saving, and potentially less exposure to technological advances.
Tips for Protecting Finances
Seniors can protect themselves from financial abuse by making sure financial records are organized and being aware of how much money is in all accounts. In addition, you can protect your assets by talking to someone at your bank, an attorney, or a financial advisor to discuss your options for ensuring your wishes for managing your money and property are followed in the event you become incapacitated. Other activities to help protect yourself include:
Tips for Family and Friends
Family and friends can also help by being aware of the many ways in which an older person may be financially exploited. There are many scams and frauds that attempt to get bank account information or Social Security numbers from the elderly to steal their identity or money. Be on the lookout for signs of possible financial abuse, including:
If you suspect elder financial abuse, talk to the victim to determine what is happening and who is involved. For instance, you’ll want to know whether a new person in their life is helping them manage their money or a relative is using their credit card without permission. If financial abuse seems likely, you may want to contact your state’s adult protective services and the local police for assistance.
You should also contact any bank or other financial institution involved to notify them of the potential abuse, and they may be able to assist you. They may not be able to provide you with specific information about accounts or transactions due to privacy laws, but they have the ability to review information for potential abuse as well as the resources to report abuse.
Also be aware of consumer financial protection regulations that help protect funds withdrawn from an account without authorization. For example, most cases of fraud and identity theft are committed using an access device, such as when an individual steals an older person’s debit card and pin number to withdraw money from a checking account.
The Electronic Fund Transfer Act, which is implemented through Regulation E, protects consumers from losses that may occur as a result of certain unauthorized electronic financial transactions, such as unauthorized ATM withdrawals and point-of-sale terminal transfers in stores. If a debit card or the card number is used to make an unauthorized withdrawal from a checking or savings account, you can minimize your losses by contacting your bank as soon as possible. Your maximum liability under Regulation E is $50 if you notify your bank within two business days after learning of the loss. Additionally, many credit card issuers have zero-liability policies, meaning that customers typically do not pay for unauthorized transactions, so contact your credit card issuer as soon as you discover any.

Excerpted and updated from “When a Criminal's Cover Is Your Identity,” Summer 2000.
Your good name and reputation are among your most valuable assets. Unfortunately, criminals know the value of a good name and reputation, too. That's why increasing numbers of con artists are “stealing” identities. They typically start by using theft or deception to learn a person's Social Security number, date of birth or other personal information. Armed with those details, the perpetrators can open credit card accounts, make purchases, take out loans, or make counterfeit checks and ATM cards in your name. In effect, the crook becomes you to commit fraud or theft.
Federal and state laws plus banking industry practices may limit your losses from identity theft, also known as ID theft. Under the Truth in Lending Act, if a crook opened a credit card account in your name and ran up thousands of dollars in charges, the most you'd owe is $50—and many creditors will agree to excuse you of all liability. Still, innocent victims are likely to face long hours (and sometimes years) closing tarnished accounts and opening new ones, fixing credit records, and otherwise cleaning up the damage. They may even be denied loans, jobs and other opportunities because an identity theft ruined their reputation and credit rating.
Here are things you can do to minimize your risk of becoming a victim of ID theft:
Protect your Social Security number, credit card numbers, account passwords and other personal information. Never divulge this kind of information unless you initiate the contact with a person or company you know and trust. A con artist can use these details and a few more, such as your mother's maiden name, to withdraw money from your bank or order credit cards or checks in your name. If you get an unsolicited offer that sounds too good to be true and asks for bank account numbers and other personal information before you receive anything in return, this is probably a scam. Likewise, if a caller claims to represent your financial institution, the police department or some similar organization and asks you to ""verify"" (reveal) confidential information, hang up fast. Real bankers and government investigators don't make these kinds of calls.
Keep thieves from turning your trash into their cash. Thieves known as “dumpster divers” pick through garbage looking for credit card applications and receipts, canceled checks, bank statements, expired charge cards and other documents or information they can use to counterfeit or order new checks or credit cards. Before putting these items in the garbage bin, tear them up as best you can. Any paper you don't need that contains private information should be shredded.
Pay attention to your bank account statements and credit card bills. Contact your financial institution immediately if there's a discrepancy in your records or if you notice something suspicious, such as a missing payment or an unauthorized withdrawal. While federal and state laws may limit your losses if you're victimized by a bank fraud or theft, sometimes your protections are stronger if you report the problem quickly and in writing.
Review one or more of your credit reports approximately once a year. Your credit reports (prepared by credit bureaus) will include identifying information such as your name, address, Social Security number and date of birth, as well as details about credit cards and loans in your name. Make sure each report you obtain is accurate, and that includes monitoring it for unauthorized bank accounts, credit cards and purchases. Under federal law, you can get at least one free report from each of the nationwide credit bureaus every 12 months. To order your free annual reports from the three major credit bureaus — Equifax, Experian and TransUnion — visit www.AnnualCreditReport.com or call toll-free 1-877-322-8228 .
Don't let ID theft take on a life of its own — yours. If someone is using your personal information to cash in on your name, visit www.identitytheft.gov , the federal government’s one-stop resource to help people report and recover from ID theft.

Settlement awards restitution to harmed consumers and requires the bank to provide increased oversight of third-party providers
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) announced settlements with Cross River Bank, Teaneck, New Jersey, and its institution-affiliated party, Freedom Financial Asset Management, LLC (FFAM), San Mateo, California, for unfair and deceptive practices in violation of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Act related to the marketing and origination of Consolidation Plus Loans (C+ Loans).  In addition, the FDIC found the bank and FFAM violated the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) and Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA).
As part of the settlement, Cross River Bank and FFAM stipulated to the issuance of respective Consent Orders, Orders for Restitution, and Orders to Pay Civil Money Penalties (collectively, FDIC Orders).  The FDIC Orders require restitution to harmed consumers.  Although the exact amount of restitution has not yet been finally determined, $20 million has been placed in a segregated account for the purpose of providing restitution to harmed consumers.  Additionally, the FDIC Orders assess civil money penalties of $641,750 against the bank, and $493,500 against FFAM.
Cross River Bank originates C+ Loans, an unsecured debt consolidation loan product, through FFAM.  C+ Loans are offered exclusively to consumers who contract with Freedom Debt Relief (FDR), a FFAM-affiliated debt settlement company.  C+ Loans were marketed as a way for consumers to quickly resolve their outstanding debts.  Consumers are charged a settlement fee of up to 25 percent of each debt enrolled in FDR's program.
The FDIC determined that Cross River Bank and FFAM violated federal law prohibiting unfair and deceptive practices, by, among other things:
As the originator of these loans, Cross River Bank is responsible for ensuring the C+ Loans program operates in compliance with all applicable laws.
The FDIC Orders require Cross River Bank and FFAM to develop and implement a restitution plan that covers borrowers who, from 2013 to the present, received loans originated by the bank through FFAM, and were harmed by the practices identified as being unfair and deceptive.  The restitution plan must be submitted to the FDIC for review and non-objection, and restitution calculations will be verified by an independent third-party. Consumers who are eligible for relief under the settlement are not required to take any action to receive restitution.
In addition to the payment of restitution to harmed consumers and civil money penalties, the FDIC Orders also require Cross River Bank and FFAM to take affirmative steps to ensure compliance with the FTC Act, as well as TILA and EFTA.  Cross River Bank's Order also requires adequate oversight of its third-party providers; a Compliance Management System that effectively identifies, addresses, monitors, and controls consumer protection risks associated with third-party activities; and sufficient resources to oversee third-party relationships.

Abstract
We use a matched credit bureau and mortgage dataset to identify occupancy fraud in residential
mortgage originations, that is, borrowers who misrepresented their occupancy status as owner
occupants rather than residential real estate investors. In contrast to previous studies, our dataset
allows us to show that such fraud was broad based, appearing in the government-sponsored
enterprise market and in loans held on bank portfolios as well. Mortgage borrowers who
misrepresented their occupancy status performed worse than otherwise similar owner occupants
and declared investors, defaulting at nearly twice the rate. In addition, these defaults are
significantly more likely to be “strategic” in two senses: first, that their bank card performance is
better and utilization rates lower; in addition, the default decisions of fraudulent investors in
significantly more sensitive to house price changes. Finally, we show that the interest rates paid
by fraudulent investors were only modestly higher for private securitized and GSE-guaranteed
loans, suggesting that they were not able to consistently identify such fraud; by contrast, those
fraudulent investors whose mortgages were held on bank portfolios paid significantly higher
rates.

I. Introduction
Policymakers and the popular press have cited anecdotal evidence to suggest that one of the
contributing causes to the housing bubble was pervasive mortgage fraud.1 Recent academic work has also
verified the existence of mortgage fraud along several dimensions. Ben-David (2011) finds evidence of
inflated prices. Griffin and Maturana (2015a) examine three dimensions of fraud among securitized
nonagency loans: unreported second liens, owner occupancy misreporting, and appraisal overstatements.
Piskorski, Seru, and Witkin (2015) study second lien misreporting and occupancy fraud in the nonagency
securized market. Mian and Sufi (2015) argue that borrowers misstated their incomes on mortgage
applications.
In this paper, we use a matched credit bureau and mortgage dataset to identify occupancy fraud in
loans originated between 2005 and 2007. This occurs when mortgage borrowers claim on the mortgage
application that they will be the owner occupants of the property, will not rent the property out to another
individual or family, and do not intend to sell the property quickly. Borrowers may have an incentive to
commit occupancy fraud because the benefits can be substantial: Banks often require declared residential
mortgage investors to offer higher down payments and charge them higher interest rates because of the
elevated default risk of investor loans (which we also document in this paper). In contrast to previous
work, our data allow us to confirm that occupancy fraud was pervasive and did not just affect private-
securitized loans. It appeared in government-sponsored enterprise (GSE)–guaranteed, private securitized,
and portfolio-held loans (by contrast, Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loans exhibited markedly
lower fraud rates). We show that accounting for fraudulent investors more than doubles the size of the
effective investor population, and that these fraudulent investors are concentrated amongst the prime
population.
After we have identified these investors from the matched credit bureau and mortgage data, we
compare the performance of the honest homeowners, the fraudulent investors, and the honest declared
investors. We find that the fraudulent investors, after controlling for available characteristics, performed
substantially worse than otherwise similar honest homeowners and declared investors. We find that they
make up an 18% of the dollar share of defaulted loans for originations during this time period.

This is significant, as Adelino, Schoar and Severino (2016), and Foote et al (2016) have argued
that much of the increase in net borrowing in the housing boom, and defaults during the bust, can be
attributed to the prime sector.
Using the credit bureau data, we gain an understanding of the borrowers’ other consumer
liabilities, particularly bank cards. We find that the fraudulent investors who defaulted on their mortgages
had significantly lower bank card utilization rates and were likelier to be current on these accounts
relative to both honest homeowners and declared investors.
Finally, we also interact consider the impact of state laws concerning deficiency judgments on this
strategic behavior. Ghent and Kudlyak (2011) have shown that state laws that limit lenders’ ability to
pursue deficiency judgments are associated with higher default rates. We confirm this for honest
homeowners and fraudulent investors. Conversely, we also show that declared investors’ default behavior
is unaffected by these laws, which reflects the fact that many states restrict the prohibition against
pursuing deficiency judgments to owner-occupied properties (see Pence, 2006).
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section II describes the related literature.
Section III describes the data we have used. Section IV documents our definition of mortgage occupancy
fraud. Section V provides descriptive statistics on occupancy fraud. Section VI covers loan performance.
Section VII presents the results from estimating our econometric models. And Section VIII concludes.
II. Related Literature
This paper is not the first to examine the role of owner occupancy fraud and its impact on loan
performance. Although they do not focus on fraud per se, Haughwout, Lee, Tracy, and van der Klaauw
(2011) were among the first to use credit bureau data to explore the role of real estate investors during the
mortgage boom and to show that the self-reported occupancy status may paint a misleading picture. They
document significant increases in the share of purchase mortgages attributed to borrowers with multiple
first lien mortgages in their credit files, with as many as half of all purchase mortgages attributable to
investors in states that experienced the largest housing booms and busts. They also show that such
investors account for a substantial share of defaults.
Several different strands of mortgage misrepresentation are explored in the literature. Garmaise
(2015) explores the role of borrower misreporting of personal assets just above round number thresholds.

He finds that borrowers who reported above-threshold assets were 25 percentage points more likely to
default. Mian and Sufi (2015) explore the role of fraudulent income overstatement on mortgage
applications. They compare the growth in income as implied by mortgage applications with the average
Internal Revenue Service–reported income growth at the zip code level, and they find that there was
substantial divergence between these two series. Income overstatement was higher in zip codes with low
credit scores and low incomes; Mian and Sufi show that borrowers in these zip codes experienced some of
the most significant increases in mortgage credit during the boom.
Piskorski et al. (2015) analyze privately securitized loans and find that second lien
misrepresentation was widespread and occurred late in the intermediation process (e.g., by the
underwriters of the residential mortgage-backed securities). More relevant to our paper, in their Internet
Appendix, they detail additional analysis on the role of owner occupancy misrepresentation in their
sample of privately securitized loans. They infer owner occupancy misrepresentation by comparing the
property zip code reported by the residential mortgage backed securities (RMBS) trustee with 12 months
of credit bureau–reported zip codes for the matched borrower. If none of these zip codes matches, then the
authors conclude that this loan was characterized by owner occupancy fraud.
Note that this method of inference does not allow them to identify within–zip code
misrepresentation, that is, fraudulent investors who misrepresent their owner occupancy status in the zip
code in which they normally live. These “smart money” investors (Li, 2015) are likely aware of local
trends and factors that should affect the value of local real estate, as opposed to distant speculators who
trade on noise and create mispricing in local markets (Chinco and Mayer, 2015). We show, however, that
occupancy fraud affected mortgages originated both to those living in the same zip code as well as those
in different zip codes. In addition, we can identify occupancy fraud not just for loans that were privately
securitized, but also loans insured by the GSEs and those held in bank portfolios. Griffin and Maturana
(2015a) also examine three types of fraud (unreported second liens, owner occupancy misreporting, and
appraisal overstatements) in privately securitized loans by matching to deeds data. They find that nearly
half of the loans examined had at least one form of fraud and that these loans had 51% higher delinquency
rates than otherwise comparable loans. They argue that investors appeared to be unaware of the
incendence of fraud. Finally, they explore the extent to which mortgage fraud and misrepresentation were
responsible for the recent house price boom–bust cycle (2015b).

III. Data Description
We use a data set known as CRISM, or Credit Risk Insight Servicing McDash.2 It is a match
between loan-level mortgage data from McDash Analytics (formerly known as LPS) and credit bureau
data from Equifax. Personally identifiable information has been removed. CRISM’s monthly observations
begin in June 2005. We restrict our data to borrowers who
(1) Are listed as the “primary” borrower in CRISM;
(2) Are available and listed as primary borrowers in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York
Consumer Credit Panel (FRBNY CCP); and
(3) Originated a first lien purchase mortgage loan for a single-family unit in the McDash data set
between June 2005 and 2007.
Table 9 gives a comparison of our sample with the loans originated during this time period from
the entire McDash dataset.
Crucial to our occupancy fraud identification process, we further focus on CRISM-matched
borrowers who also appear in the FRBNY CCP, so that we can use information on the borrowers’
scrambled addresses. We also restrict to borrowers who have scrambled address, zip code, and state data
from Equifax one quarter before and four quarters after their matched McDash mortgages originated. Our
definition of occupancy fraud is discussed in detail in Section IV.
We focus on borrowers with self-reported McDash occupancy type as owner occupants, declared
investors and second home buyers. We also exclude the small number of loans with origination loan-to-
value ratios (LTVs) either under 25% or exceeding 120%, loans whose matched borrowers’ bank card
utilization at first mortgage default was greater than 150%, loans whose McDash investor type six
months after origination was a Ginnie Mae buyout loan, local housing authority, federal home loan bank,
and unknown and mortgages with origination amounts exceeding $1 million. We also exclude Equifax
borrowers whose address type is a post office box either one quarter before or two quarters after their
matched McDash first lien originated.. Our final dataset consists of 146,425 loans, matched to 142,775
distinct borrowers.4
2 See Beraja et al (2015) for more detail on the CRISM dataset.
4 We begin with 3,727,623 McDash mortgages meeting criterion (3) who were also matched to consumers in Equifax in
CRISM. Among these approximately 3.7 million consumers in CRISM, about 10% (369,541) are also found in the FRBNY

Our house price index (HPI) data come from CoreLogic, and we use zip code–level house price indices
for single-family detached homes (including distressed sales) when available and state-level indices
otherwise. Our county-level unemployment rates come from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)
IV. Defining Occupancy Fraud
A key aspect of our experimental design is the identification of fraudulent investors. We discuss
our definition and compare it with others in the literature. Importantly, the CRISM data enable us to
compare the self-reported occupancy type from the McDash Analytics loan-level data with information
from the borrowers’ Equifax matched credit bureau file. Our goal is to identify and classify borrowers
who self-report owner occupancy on their purchase mortgage applications (judged by the McDash data)
but who appear to be investors judging by their credit history information. In our owner occupancy fraud
classification algorithm, we focus on three pieces of information:
1. The self-reported occupancy type;
2. The count of first-lien mortgages four quarters after their matched McDash mortgage is
originated;
3. The borrowers’ Equifax scrambled address from one quarter before and four quarters after
when the McDash mortgage originated.
Using these data, we identify four types of borrowers:
1. Honest owner occupants: These are reported in the McDash data set as having originated
an owner-occupied home purchase loan and whose Equifax scrambled addresses one
quarter before and four quarters after their matched McDash mortgage originated are
different.
2. Fraudulent investors: These are reported in the McDash data set as having originated an
owner-occupied home purchase loan and whose Equifax scrambled addresses is the same
one quarter before and four quarters after their matched McDash mortgage originated. The
borrower’s credit bureau file also reports more than 1 first lien mortgage four quarters after
the matched lien was originated as well.
CCP. So, we focus on these 366,065 borrowers, matched to 369,541 mortgage loans, and after we apply the additional
restrictions described above, our final data set consists of 146,425 loans matched to 142,775 distinct borrowers.

3. Declared investors: These are borrowers who are reported in the McDash data set as
taking out a mortgage for the purchase of an investment property.
4. Second home buyers: These are borrowers who are reported in the McDash data set as
taking out a mortgage for the purchase of a second home.
Note that we drop mortgages that do not fit in one of these four criteria. We further restrict our
attention to borrowers in the McDash data with single-family property types to avoid situations in which
our fraud classifier does not pick up an address change because of borrowers moving within a large
multifamily unit. Any concerns concerning the accuracy of the fraud classifier should bias downward the
likelihood of finding that these borrowers behave differently.
In Figures 7a and 7b we show that these criteria lead to a clear distinction between honest
homeowners and investors. The fraudulent investors are much closer to declared investors – both in terms
of their likelihood to change address and their propensity to have multiple first liens – than they are to
honest homeowners. In addition, this fugures also demonstrate that there is little drift in these variables
over time after 4 quarters following origination, which implies that we are unlikely to simply be picking
up slow updating of addresses and liens in the credit bureau files.
Our methodology of identifying owner occupancy misrepresentation differs from other papers that
have address the phenomenon, and we provide evidence that our approach has a number of benefits that
improve on existing work. Both Griffin and Maturana (2015a) and Piskorski, Seru, and Witkin (2015)
confine their analysis to private securitized loans (primarily subprime and jumbo mrotgages). By contrast,
we are able to study the extent of fraud across the entire universe of mortgage and loan types. As we show
below, this substantially increases to total amount of fraud. In particular, we find significant incidence of
fraud amongst prime GSE-guaranteed loans and those held on bank portfolios.
Also recall that Piskorski et al. (2015) classifies a loan as truly owner occupied if — for 12 months
of data after the mortgage originates — one of the borrowers’ zip codes from Equifax matches the
property’s zip code reported to the RMBS trustee. Our method, by contrast, enables us to identify
fraudulent investors who purchase and finance a purportedly owner-occupied property in the same zip
code in which they reside. We show below that this category represents a significant fraction of the
fraudulent investor pool, with distinct default behavior.

V. Descriptive Statistics
In this section, we compare origination characteristics by borrower type, that is, honest owner
occupants, fraudulent investors, declared investors and second home buyers.
Incidence of Occupancy Fraud
In Table 2a we show the share of borrowers by vintage half years and the intended investor type of
the mortgage who are classified as misrepresenting their occupancy status according to our definition of
occupancy fraud. Similar to Piskorksi (2015) we find a significant drop in the share of owner occupancy
misrepresentation among private-securitized loans from the first half of 2007 to the second half 2007,
consistent with the tighter standards that were reported in this market,5 but at the same time we find slight
increases in the share of owner occupancy misrepresentation among other types of loans, particularly
GSE-guaranteed mortgages, and loans held on the bank’s portfolio. Overall, our estimate of the share of
borrowers misrepresenting their occupancy status peaks in the first half of 2006 at 6.4% while it declines
to 5.2% for the 2007 second half vintage. We also show in Figure 8 that the fraud share continued to drop
further after 2007, leveling off at around 2.5% for originations from 2009-2014.
FICO Scores at Origination
Gao and Li (2012), find that most declared residential real estate investors are prime. We confirm
their results: the subprime share amongst declared investors is only 10%, as compared to 26% for honest
owner occupants (Table 2). We also show that the fraudulent investors we identify are overwhelmingly
prime as well: the subprime share in this group is one third lower than amongst the honest owner-
occupants.
The Geography of Mortgage Occupancy Fraud
Because occupancy fraud may have been undertaken to facilitate property speculation, Figure 1
gives a heat map with the state-level mortgage occupancy fraud rate for self-reported owner-occupied
mortgages for loans that were originated between 2005H2 and 2007. The geographic patterns are
informative: In the continental U.S., it appears that occupancy fraud rates were highest in California
(15.5%), Hawaii (14.1%), Nevada (12.8%), Florida (10.7%), Arizona (10.5%), New York (7.4%), New
Jersey (7.4%) Maryland (7.3%), and Illinois (7.1%). Iowa had the lowest estimated occupancy fraud rate
5 Similarly, there is a sharp drop in the share of private securitized subprime loans in the LPS dataset second half of 2007.
8
at 1.3%. We also show below that occupancy fraud was associated with prior run-ups in house prices in
the originating zip code (see also table 2).
As we next discuss, the origination characteristics also appear to suggest that the fraudulent
investors took on substantially riskier mortgages than declared investors and honest homeowners. We will
see later in this paper how they performed on their debt obligations as the housing boom came to an end
and house prices began their collapse across the country.
Originating Loan-to-Value Ratios
Not surprisingly, based on the reported first-lien origination loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, honest
homeowners put down the lowest down payments, and declared investors put down the highest down
payments on their properties. Fraudulent investors had a mean origination LTV ratio of 78.7%, closer to
honest homeowners’ mean LTV (81.8%) than to the LTV ratio of the declared investors (75.7%). This
higher LTV represented a substantial advantage for borrowers who misrepresented their occupancy type
because originators tend to require higher down payments from declared investors to compensate for the
known additional risk of default associated with real estate investors.
Second Liens and Combined Loan-to-Value Ratios
Our credit bureau data also allow us to check for the incidence of both closed-end and revolving
second liens (HELOCs). We focus on the presence of second liens around the time of origination of their
matched McDash first-lien purchase mortgages; specifically, we wait two quarters to capture the second
liens to allow time for them to appear in the credit bureau data. We find that the fraudulent investors
behaved much more similar to the declared investors than the honest homeowners in terms of the
incidence of second liens. We find that 28.6% of the honest homeowners had second liens around first
lien origination, while 50.3% of fraudulent investors and 53.2% of declared investors had second liens
around origination (see Table 2).
The widespread incidence of second liens around origination implies that the LTV ratios
calculated from the matched McDash first liens are an underestimate of the true overall equity positions of
the borrowers. Because the credit bureau data have not only the count of second liens but also the balance
9
associated with them, we add these balances to the origination amount and divide by the appraisal amount
to get an estimate of the combined LTV ratio for each property. We find that the equity positions were
worse than the first-lien LTV ratios implied, With the fraudulent investors having a mean estimated
CLTV ratio of 92.2% and declared investors having a mean estimated CLTV ratio of 104.2%.
Incidence of Adjustable-Rate, Interest-Only, and Jumbo Mortgages
Among the self-reported owner occupants, 9.7% of those we identify as honestly representing
their owner occupancy financed their homes with an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM). However, we find
that fraudulent investors were 9.3 percentage points more likely to have entered into an ARM. Fraudulent
investors’ higher preference for ARMs more closely resembled that of declared investors (Table 2), who
financed their properties with ARMs at a rate of 17.3% on average. This is consistent with the possibility
that fraudulent investors were intending to hold these properties for a short period of time, thus making
them less sensitive to changes in interest rates. An alternative explanation is that taking out an ARM is
motivated by a desired by investors to conserve liquidity, given that they also have another mortgage.
Similarly, the share of mortgages that were interest-only at origination was substantially higher for
the fraudulent investors among the self-declared pool of owner occupants across both prime and subprime
borrowers. At its peak, fraudulent investors in the 2006 vintage were more than twice as likely as honest
homeowners to have had an interest-only mortgage. Interestingly, the interest-only share for the 2007
vintage of declared investors was more similar to that of the honest homeowners (Figure 2).
We also find that fraudulent investors identified from the pool of self-declared owner occupants
were more likely to take out a jumbo mortgage, that is, one with an origination amount that exceeded the
GSEs’ (e.g., Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac) conforming loan limit — the maximum value of a mortgage that
they can buy from the originator. In fact, we found that this is true for loans that originated in both the
bubble states where the housing boom and bust was accentuated and in states where the boom and bust
was not as pronounced.
Interest Rates
From Table 2, we see that interest rates on fraudulent mortgages are slightly higher than those taken out
by honest homeowners, but significantly lower than those for declared investors. This is true even when
comparing within intended investor type and fixed-rate versus adjustable-rate mortgages (Table 2b). As
10
discussed earlier, the desire for a lower interest rate than that offered to declared investors is likely one of
the motivations for borrower fraud. The fact that the rate is slightly higher than that for honest
homeowners may reflect the fact that lenders are able to identify some of these borrowers, or it may
simply reflect the fact that the fraudulent investors are also riskier along observable dimensions, as seen in
Table 2. We study this issue further in section VII below. In any case, as will become clear, the slightly
higher interest rate is not sufficient to compensate for the much higher default risk of these fraudulent
loans.
Investor Type
From Table 2a, we see that the fraud share was highest for private securitized loans, peaking at
10.5% for loans originated in the second half of 2005. This is consistent with other evidence indicating
that underwriting standards were laxer in this market during this period. However we show that it was
also high for portfolio loans. While the fraud rate for GSE loans was lower, we note that considering only
private securitized loans (as previous studies do), would have missed more than half of all fraudulent
mortgages.
Finally, both fraudulent and declared investors are much less likely to have FHA-guaranteed
loans. This is likely because of the stricter enforcement of FHA owner occupancy requirements.
Zip Codes in Credit Bureau and Mortgage Datasets
As discussed, our method for identifying fraudulent mortgages allows us to uncover occupancy fraud by
borrowers whose zip codes were the same in both the credit bureau and mortgage data, unlike previous
work. As we show in Table 2, this represents over a quarter of the incidence of fraud.
VI. Loan Performance: Summary Statistics
Cross-Sectional View of Mortgage Payment Performance
We investigate the delinquency and default behavior of these borrowers by examining the rate at
which borrowers became 60 or more days past due as of December 2008. For loans that originated
11
between June 2005 and December 2007, the fraudulent investors identified from the pool of self-reported
owner occupants became seriously delinquent or defaulted at more than twice the rate of honest
homeowners and declared investors. Table 3a summarizes the delinquency rates by year of origination
and borrower type.
The differences in loan performance between fraudulent and honest buyers are particularly striking
for borrowers in the prime (with FICO scores between 680 and 739) and super prime (with FICO scores
between 740 and 850) credit score categories. As of December 2008, fraudulent investors went into
serious delinquency at more than five times the rate of honest homeowners among the pool of super-prime
honest owner occupants (Figure 4). Among borrowers with originating FICO scores between 680 and 739
as of December 2008, 7.8% of the honest homeowners entered serious delinquency or default, while
27.5% of the fraudulent investors identified from the population of self-declared owner occupants had
gone into serious delinquency or default. The differences are also substantial among the subprime
borrowers (with FICO scores between 620 and 679) and even among the deep subprime (with FICO
scores between 550 and 619) borrowers (Table 3b).
House prices peaked in early 2007 and began to fall until early 2011. In one set of analyses, we
followed our borrowers until December 2008, the first year and a half of the collapse in house prices.
Among loans originated in our June 2005 – Dec 2005 vintage, by December 2008, 32% of honest
homeowners and 40% of fraudulent investors were underwater with their mortgages, that is, the
outstanding value of the mortgage exceeded the estimated value of the property (Figure 5). Not
surprisingly, this is associated with much higher default rates. Among fraudulent investors with updated
LTV ratios as of December 2008 between 100% and 110% (those with slightly negative equity), 26%
were seriously delinquent or in foreclosure. This compares with 11% of honest homeowners who were
seriously delinquent or in default or foreclosure falling in the same LTV range. For borrowers with deeper
negative equity (in excess of 110% updated LTV), serious delinquency or default rates were 21
percentage points higher for fraudulent investors than honest owner occupants in the same category
Strategic Default: Evidence from Other Consumer Liabilities
We now present evidence from the mortgage borrowers’ matched credit bureau data to argue that
these fraudulent owner occupants may have acted strategically in their default decisions. That is, the
borrowers may have defaulted on their mortgages, not because of an inability to pay, but rather an
12
unwillingness to pay, driven by substantial declines in home value that caused many borrowers into
negative equity on their properties. We first capture each borrower’s bank card utilization rate as of
December 2008 as a proxy for the borrowers’ liquidity (Elul et al., 2010) and calculate the utilization rate
along three different dimensions: all national borrowers, borrowers with their mortgaged properties
located in bubble states, and those with properties located in non-bubble states. We also divided those
who became seriously delinquent or defaulted and those who remained current or at most 30 days past
due within each geographic group.
On average, there was very little difference in the bank card utilization or default rates among the
three borrower types (honest homeowners, fraudulent investors, declared investors and second home
buyers) when they remain current on their mortgage (Table 2). But there are significant differences in the
bank card utilization rate across borrower types for those who became seriously delinquent or defaulted as
of December 2008. Fraudulent investors who become seriously delinquent or in default on their
mortgages have significantly lower bankcard utilization rates, and are likelier to be current on their bank
cards (Tables 4a and 4b).
As shown in Figure 5, fraudulent investors were also more likely to have negative equity in their
homes as of December 2008. And those with negative equity were much more likely to be seriously
delinquent or in default as of December 2008. Not only were “underwater” borrowers much more likely
to be in serious delinquency or in default, but the fraudulent investors also had the highest default rates
relative to the honest homeowners and the declared investors. Figures 6a and 6b show the share of
borrowers in serious delinquency or in default stratified by updated LTV ratios exceeding 100%, that is,
borrowers who now owe more on their mortgages than the updated value of their house. . We show below
that, while this explains some of the higher default rate for fraudulent investors, they remain riskier even
after controlling for differences in equity. We also show below that fraudulent investors’ default decisions
are more sensitive to changes in house prices.
Taken together, the evidence on bank card utilization and negative equity at default point to the
possibility that fraudulent investors who we identified from the pool of declared owner occupants acted
more strategically in defaulting, that is, their default decisions are more likely to be driven by
considerations of home equity rather than liquidity.
13
VII. Estimations and Results
Probability of Default
We first estimate a probit model for the probability that a loan defaults as of December 2008. We
include a variety of mortgage origination characteristics, local house price and unemployment dynamics,
and data drawn from other parts of the borrowers’ credit histories as explanatory variables. We cannot
control for lender-specific fixed effects, but Griffin and Maturana (2015a) show that there is very little
variation in owner occupancy misreporting across lenders, suggesting that it is likely that these decisions
were made by the borrowers, perhaps in conjunction with brokers.
In the first specification in Table 5a, we estimate the probability of default by December 2008
with a variety of origination characteristics known to affect the likelihood of default. In addition, we
include fixed effects for the investor type of the loans six months after it was originated (FHA, GSE,
portfolio, or private label securitization); private label securitization is the excluded category. Changes in
zip code–level house price and unemployment dynamics are captured as well from origination to
December 2008. State and origination year fixed effects are also included (2005 is the excluded
origination year). All covariates have the expected signs and are highly statistically and economically
significant. Of particular interest is the occupancy fraud dummy variable, which we note is both highly
statistically significant and economically significant in explaining the probability of mortgage default. It
is also three times the size of the coefficient for declared investors.
In the second column, we include an additional dummy variable for whether the borrower has
multiple first-lien mortgages in his or her credit bureau file four quarters after his or her matched McDash
first-lien mortgage was originated. The coefficient is highly statistically significant in explaining
mortgage default. Recall also from Table 2 that declared investors are very likely to have multiple first
liens, and indeed, accounts for all of the additional risk associated with declared investor. Moreover, we
see that second home buyers, who are also likely to have multiple first liens, are much less risky. On the
other hand, although including this indicator reduces the explanatory power of the fraudulent investor
dummy by approximately half, significant default risk remains.
In column (3) we also add an indicator for having a second lien, obtained from the credit bureau
data; again this is associated with elevated default risk, as is known from other work (e.g., Elul et al,
2010). In column (4) we compute the marginal effects associated with specification (3). We see that,
holding all else constant, a fraudulent investor is still 3.6 percentage points more likely to default than an
14
otherwise similar borrower, relative to an average default rate of 10.6% percent. This is roughly
equivalent to an origination FICO score that is 36 points lower.
In the fifth specification, we estimate the probability of default with a probit model similar to
specification (1) but where we allow for the possibility of interaction between our two types of investors
— fraudulent and declared — and whether the loans was FHA guaranteed, GSE, private securitized, or
held in portfolio. For both declared and fraudulent investors, we find that the interaction effects are either
not statistically significant or very modest in magnitude, that is, they have higher default rates regardless
of investor type. This is not the case for FHA-guaranteed loans, however. The interaction between FHA
and fraud is negative, and the sum of this interaction and the fraud level effect is statistically insignificant:
FHA loans classified as fraudulent are no more likely to default than any other FHA loan.
In the sixth specification, we add an indicator variable for states that prohibit deficiency judgments
to the model of column (4) of Table 4a. Ghent and Kudlyak (2011) have shown that state laws that limit
lenders’ ability to pursue deficiency judgments are associated with higher default rates. We confirm this
for honest homeowners and fraudulent investors; interestingly, we also see that fraudulent investors are no
more likely to be affected by these laws than honest homeowners. By contrast, however, we find negative
interactions for that declared investors and second mortgages, which may reflect the fact that many states
restrict the prohibition against pursuing deficiency coefficients on the judgments to owner-occupied
properties.
Strategic Default and the Probability of High Bank Card Utilization
In Table 6a, we estimate probit models for the probability — among borrowers with active mortgages
who are not seriously delinquent or default on their first-lien mortgage as of December 2008 — that their
total bank card utilization rate as of December 2008 (reported in their credit bureau files) exceeds 80%. In
column (2) we add an indicator for whether the borrower has multiple first liens, which could represent an
additional source of liquidity shocks (as indeed shown by the positive coefficient), and in column (3) we
account for second liens, which might also be associated with a need for liquidity (again the coefficient is
positive). Column (4) gives the marginal effects associated with model (3). In all of these specifications,
we find that after controlling for other characteristics (e.g., origination FICO score), occupancy fraud is
not statistically significant; that is, for mortgages that are current as of December 2008, there is no
significant difference in bank card utilization rate between honest homeowners and fraudulent investors.
Declared investors and second home buyers are modestly more likely to have higher utilization.
15
As far as the other covariates, higher origination FICO scores are associated with lower utilization,
and higher origination LTV ratios are associated with higher utilization, as expected. Higher
unemployment rates and higher current LTV ratios are associated with higher utilization, likely reflecting
local economic stresses. ARM borrowers have higher utilization; this is consistent with earlier work
showing that those taking out ARMs are likelier to be borrowing-constrained (Johnson and Li, 2014).
In Table 6b, we estimate the same models for the probability of high credit utilization, but we
focus on the group of borrowers who had a seriously delinquency or default as measured by becoming 60
days or more past due on their first-lien mortgages as of December 2008Utilization is measured here as
of December 2008. In comparing the results to those of Table 6a, we notice several striking differences.
First, fraudulent investors are significantly less likely to have high utilization rates at the time of default,
reflecting, as suggested earlier, a more strategic approach to default. In particular, they are 10.1
percentage points less likely to have had high bank card utilization rates, relative to an average for
defaulted borrowers of 52.6 percentage points for the entire sample (column 4). In addition, high current
LTV is associated with lower incidence of high utilization, in contrast to the results for non-defaulters.
This is consistent with the “double-trigger” theory of mortgage default (see, for example, Elul et al.,
2010).
Finally, to further support our argument that the fraudulent investors behave more strategically, we
also rerun the baseline mortgage default model, but add interactions between the borrower type and
changes in house prices and unemployment rates. The results, reported in column (7) of Table 5a, confirm
this: fraudulent investors’ default decisions are significantly more sensitive to declines in house prices
than other borrowers (the converse is true for declared investors), and insensitive to unemployment rates.
Determinants of Fraudulent Investors
In Table 7, we estimate models for the probability of a self-declared owner occupant being a
fraudulent investor. Recall our definition of a fraudulent investor: These are self-reported owner
occupants who did not change their Equifax scrambled addresses within the one quarter before and four
quarters after window around the time their matched McDash mortgages originated and have more than
one first-lien mortgage on their credit files four quarters after origination.
16
These multivariate estimation results generally confirm the summary statistics, reported earlier.
We find that FHA loans are 4.9 percentage points less likely to be fraudulent, relative to an overall rate of
5.95 percent. GSE-guaranteed loans are also modestly less likely to be fraudulent.
Fraudulent investors are also associated with various indicators of housing bubbles such as higher
lagged house price appreciation. Similarly, in the final specification we replace the state fixed effects with
a bubble state dummy and find a significant positive coefficient on the bubble state dummy.
Fraudulent investors are also associated with higher origination amounts, interest-only loans,
ARMs, low or unknown documentation loans, and broker-originated loans (as in the previous literature).
They are also significantly more common in 2007, consistent with Haughwout et al. (2011).
Interest Rates
In Table 8, we present regression models for the interest rate at origination (or when first available). In
order to create more uniform samples, we restrict attention to mortgages with 30-year terms, and, for
ARMs, we further to those with the most common initial fixed-rate periods: 1, 12, 24, 36, 60, 84, and 120
months. Taken together, these account for 70% of all mortgages in our sample. The fact that we do not
have information on fees and points should generally be expected to attenuate our results.
The control variables have the expected signs: higher origination FICO scores are associated with
lower rates, with a discrete jump at 660. Higher LTV ratios are also associated with higher rates. Low-doc
loans, IO’s, and broker-originated mortgages also have higher rates. FHA, GSE and mortgages held on
bank portfolios all have lower rates, relative to the omitted category, private securitized loans. Having
multiple first liens is associated with higher rates.6
Turning now to the primary coefficients of interest, we see that fraudulent pay slightly higher rates
on average, 14bp for FRM (column 1) and 18bp for ARMs (column 3), confirming the results reported in
Table 2b. For declared investors, the effect is much larger: 49bp for FRM and 59bp for ARMs.
When we consider the interactions in columns (2) and (4), we see some striking differences. We
find rates for fraudulent investors that are not significantly higher than those for honest homeowners for
FHA and GSE-guaranteed loans (columns 2 and 4), suggesting that the ultimate investors may not have
6 In these models we measure the number of liens one quarter following origination, in contrast to previous tables.
17
been able to identify the fraudulent loans. By contrast, for private securitized loans (the omitted
category), we find a modest effect, and for loans held on bank portfolios, the rate is over 50 basis points
higher. These results suggest that, particularly for loans that were held by banks, there was some
understanding of the additional risk of these loans (although the higher rate was not sufficient to offset the
elevated default risk, in retrospect). Finally, for declared investors interest rates are higher than for honest
homeowners across all investor types.
Distance and Default (in progress)
Chinco and Mayer (2016) study out-of-town “second home buyers.” They define these as borrowers
whose tax bills were sent to different MSAs than the property address. They show that their purchases
drove price appreciation. They also show that they acted like “uninformed speculators” - their realized
returns (driven by change in HPI) were lower than those of within-MSA second home buyers.
To extend their analysis, we begin with the subsample of borrowers with multiple first mortgages.
We first show (column 9 of Table 5b) that those whose Equifax zip code (4 quarters after origination) is
the same as that of the matched purchase mortgage, are much less likely to default than those whose
property is located in a different zip code. Furthermore, declared investors and second homebuyers are
also less likely to default than other multiple mortgagees.
The increased default risk may be driven by a lower attachment to these distant houses, as column
(5) of Table 6b shows that, conditional on default, those with different zip codes have lower bankcard
utilization rates. By contrast, outside of default we find insignificant effects in column (5) of Table 6a (or
at most very modest, for the most distant group).
We then further restrict attention to those whose credit bureau zip code is not the same as that of
the matched purchase mortgage. By comparing zip codes we can identify those out-of-own buyers, who
have zip codes associated with different MSAs. In Figures 9a and 9b we see that in-town investors are
roughly evenly split between honest homeowners, fraudulent investors and declared investors, whereas
second home buyers are overwhelmingly found in the out-own-town investor category.
In model (10) of Table 5b we verify that the lower returns for out-of-town investors observed by
Chinco and Mayer (2016) are associated, as expected, with elevated default rates. We also see that the
indicator variable for mortgage fraud becomes insignificant. We interpret this as suggesting that we have
18
an additional category of fraudulent investors: those with multiple mortgages and with a different zi code
in their credit bureau data.
Interacting the out-out-town indicator with the borrower type in model (11), we learn that this
additional risk for out-of-town buyers is not found amongst the declared second home buyers, nor
amongst the fraudulent investors, but, as can be confirmed by test statistics, declared investors. In other
words, a share of fraudulent investors are out-of-town, this is not associated with any additional risk for
this group; we interpret this as suggesting that fraudulent investors were more likely to be informal
investors.
Finally, in columns (12) and (13) of Table 5b we further demonstrate that most of this additional
risk remains even after controlling for changes in house prices following origination, which suggests that
differences in information across classes of speculators explains only part of the variation in default rates.
VIII. Conclusion
Using a matched credit bureau and mortgage data set to identify occupancy fraud in residential mortgages
originated between June 2005 and December 2007, we find that such fraud was widespread. In contrast to
previous studies, our data set allows us to show that occupancy fraud was common in the GSE market and
in loans held in portfolio in addition to the private label market. We found that mortgage borrowers who
misrepresented their occupancy status performed worse than otherwise similar owner occupancy
occupants and declared investors, with an incidence of default at nearly twice that of honest owner
occupants or declared investors. Fraudulent investors’ bank card utilization rates and default rates relative
to those of honest owner occupants and declared investors imply that the fraudulent investors’ mortgage
defaults may have been strategic. Our results and estimates are large and economically significant and
demonstrate one important role that occupancy fraud played during U.S. housing boom and bust.

Table 8: OLS regression models for the interest rate at the time of origination (or when first available), for 30-year mortgages
originated between June 2005 and December 2007. Column (1) is for borrowers with fixed rate mortgages; column (2) adds the
interactions between the borrower type and investor type. Columns (3) is for adjustable-rate mortgages with initial fixed-rate
terms of 1, 12, 24, 36, 60, 84, and 120 months; column (4) again adds the interactions between the borrower type and investor
type. All specifications include (but do not report) a constant term, state fixed effects, origination month-year fixed effects; the
ARM regressions also include dummy variables for the initial fixed term. Source: Authors’ calculations of McDash Analytics,

FDIC Publishes a Bank Customer’s Guide to Cybersecurity
Special edition of consumer newsletter feature tips for preventing online fraud and theft
Consumers increasingly rely on computers and the Internet for everything from shopping and communicating to
banking and bill paying. While the benefits of faster and more convenient “cyber” services are clear, the strategies
for preventing online fraud and theft may not be as well-known by many bank customers. That is why the FDIC has
produced a special edition of the agency's quarterly FDIC Consumer News (Winter 2016) entitled “A Bank
Customer’s Guide to Cybersecurity.” Here is a brief overview of the articles and other features in this special issue.
Safety precautions to take before connecting to the Internet with a personal computer, laptop, smartphone or
tablet: The lead article discusses ways to protect log-in information for bank accounts and other financial accounts,
including the use of “strong” user IDs and passwords that will be hard for a hacker to guess, basic security measures such
as security software updates, and the need to be careful where and how to connect to the Internet. Other articles focus on
security measures when using a smartphone or tablet (including ""auto lock"" features and the ability to remotely remove
data if a mobile device is lost or stolen), how to protect computers from malicious software (“malware”) that can steal
valuable personal financial information, and ideas to help small businesses protect against losses from cyberattacks.
Tips on how to avoid identity theft online: One article advises on identifying and avoiding “phishing” and
“pharming” scams that start with fake emails and websites and end with consumers providing Social Security
numbers, bank account numbers and other valuable details. A second article offers assistance on preventing
identity thieves from using social networking sites to learn enough information about individuals to figure out
passwords, access financial accounts or commit identity theft. And a third provides guidance to help parents and
caregivers protect young people from cyber-related identity theft and financial fraud, including the need to secure
all electronics connected to the Web, even video games, because the equipment may link to information such as
credit or debit card numbers.
What to know about the roles that banks and the government play in protecting customers: As explained in
one article, federal law and regulations require financial institutions to have programs to ensure the security and
confidentiality of customer information. The article also notes that banking regulators expect the institutions they
supervise to have a framework for learning about emerging threats and provide guidance about the steps
institutions can take to be prepared. Another article describes how federal consumer laws and financial industry
practices protect cybertheft victims from losses under certain circumstances. And, our “Dear FDIC” feature
answers questions about deposit insurance coverage and online banking.
Additional resources from the FDIC that can help educate consumers: The back of the guide features an
eight-question quiz to test a consumer’s knowledge of key information in this issue and a checklist with reminders
about 10 simple things bank customers can do to help protect themselves from online criminals.
The goal of FDIC Consumer News is to deliver timely, reliable and innovative tips and information about financial
matters, free of charge. The Winter 2016 special edition on cybersecurity can be read or printed at
www.fdic.gov/consumers/consumer/news/cnwin16. Check back there for coming versions of this issue for e-
readers and portable audio (MP3) players. To find current and past issues, visit www.fdic.gov/consumernews, or

behavior, particularly in the context of a fraudulent subscription service. It highlights how poor default options can lead to significant errors in decision-making, especially among less educated and lower-income populations. The authors present evidence from a lawsuit against a company that used deceptive marketing practices to enroll customers in a subscription service, resulting in daily charges that many consumers were unaware of. The findings suggest that changing the default settings in enrollment processes can significantly reduce fraud and improve consumer outcomes, as evidenced by the exogenous variation created by the lawsuit.",payment fraud - subscription fraud,unknown,"{""fraud_type"": ""payment fraud - subscription fraud"", ""detection_method"": ""unknown""}",Unknown,Counterfeit Fraud,Other / Unknown,"Knowing When to Quit: Default Choices,

Outline
• Overview: evidence about impact of defaults
and demographics on making right choice
• Background: Fraud case leads to same choice
under 3 exogenously assigned choice structures
• Regression Discontinuity: Poor defaults causes
60+% of the population to make errors
• Hazard: Low SES neighborhoods less
responsive to enrollment-by-default letters; quit
more when charged
• Welfare effects: Cancellation default saves
$400+ relative to 2 observed alternatives
• Conclusion
We observe who makes the
choice right under 3 structures
• Exiting is the right choice: Fraud
enrolled people in (nearly) useless
subscriptions that charged until they quit
• Lawsuit creates exogenous variation in
defaults and decision structure
– Enrolled <5 months: Cancellation default
– Enrolled >5 months: Enrollment default
Direct evidence that bad defaults cause (many) mistakes.
Quit rate before and after transition to cancellation default
Demographics interact with decision
structure when enrollment is the default
• Observe enrollment as default. When
people from less wealthy/educated
neighborhoods get:
– charges they are more likely to exit
– letters they are less likely to exit
• Making cancellation the default could save
$400 per subscriber

Suntasia used deceptive phone
calls to enroll ~750,000 customers
• Phone calls:
– Claimed to represent bank
– Offered “free” reward
– Read routing number; asked consumer to
“verify” their checking account number

Econometric model
• Discrete time hazard rate is a logit.
• Model all billing cycles before the lawsuit
plus all enrollment letters.
• We truncate cancellation letter recipients
at the time of the lawsuit
• Coefficients on demographics X = attrition
while firm operated; on Letter*X = predict
response to enrollment letters
Hazard rate model finds the same pattern. The story comes through in
several variables; quirks in measurement complicate interpretation
This leads to a 10-20% difference in predicted
attrition rates between residents of low SES and
high SES neighborhoods
Cancellation default outperforms enrollment default
with letters and charges by >$400

FDIC 5th Annual Consumer Research
Symposium
October 15 2015
Overview
• Both studies examine behavior in light of a
naturally occurring experiment:
– “Identity Theft as a Teachable Moment”—
The effect of realizing one’s identity was stolen.
– “Knowing When to Quit”—
The effect of court assignment into either subscription
cancellation as default or subscription continuation as
default.
October 15 2015
Behavioral Aspects?
– Identity Theft as a Teachable Moment”—
The study, examining the effect of identity theft on future
financial consequences, is not behavioral per-se.
The results show an unintended positive consequence on
low SES individuals.
This is difficult to explain with usual machinery. One
way to explain this is that the event increased attention.
Contribution: ID theft can be thought of as a strong
reminder.
October 15 2015
Behavioral Aspects?
– “Knowing When to Quit”—
The goal of this study is to measure the effect of defaults
on subscription cancellation.
This study is a direct measure of the effects of defaults
which, according to the standard model, should not play
a role.
Contribution: while default were shown to affect
behavior in other context, this paper explores default
effects in an environment where the optimal action is
known.
October 15 2015
Identity Theft as a Teachable Moment
• Goal: To examine financial behavior and
outcomes post realizing ID theft.
• Measure of ID Theft:
– Extended fraud alert on credit report.
– This remains on the report for 7 years; during the first
5 years prescreened credit and insurance offers are
banned.
– Further proxy of severity of the ID theft is address
change at the alert quarter. This is often the case
when there are attempts to open fraudulent accounts.
October 15 2015
Identity Theft as a Teachable Moment
• Empirical Strategy:
– Using propensity score—the probability of being
assigned to the “treatment” group—to match similar
individuals that ended up not being subject to ID
theft.
– Propensity score calculated based on a year lag
measures.
– Compare behavior (credit score, number of accounts
in collection, number of inquiries, etc.) of treated vs.
matched-control groups, splitting analysis by prime
status.
October 15 2015
Identity Theft as a Teachable Moment
• Results:
– Reported by prime(>660) and subprime(≤660)
consumers
• Prime: no significant difference after the alert
• Subprime: significant increase in risk/credit scores,
fewer accounts in collection, but higher number of
inquiries.
October 15 2015
October 15 2015
October 15 2015
Identity Theft as a Teachable Moment
• Comments:
– At the core of the study is the comparison of individuals in the
treatment vs. matched-control groups.
– If the effect is truly of inattention, and the ID theft event act as
a reminder, it may be the case that individuals were subjects
to fraud long before the alert, even more than a year or two.
• Inattentive prime individuals may be compared to
subprime individuals (in the control)
• One robustness check shows that less attentive consumers
(those w/o inquiry 6 months prior), experience a larger
effect. This is consistent with the possibility of a mismatch.
October 15 2015
Identity Theft as a Teachable Moment
• Comments:
• Results using matching based on measures 8 quarters
after the alert show that immediately after the alert the
treatment group is similar to the control, but before the
alert the treatment group has significantly lower scores.
That is consistent with a story of mismatch of types.
• Suggestions:
• It may be more appropriate to compare those who file
other, less involved, forms of alert to a match-control.
Since these people probably did not end up having ID
theft, but the suspicion did increase their attention.
October 15 2015
Identity Theft as a Teachable Moment
• Suggestions:
• Maybe it is possible to identify identity theft in the data
that is not yet flagged—such as a sudden reduction in
score along with change in address and increase in
collection a few quarters later that is out of the
ordinary—and match these individuals to the
treatment group?
• Lastly, by filing a report to put on alert, these
individuals may not only be paying more attention, but
they reveal that they are also action-minded people.

Knowing When to Quit:
Default Choices, Demographics and Fraud
• Goal: Examine the effect of default on
behavior in a naturally occurring experiment
in the case of Suntasia Marketing.
• Measure:
– Rate of subscriptions cancellation by the type of
default , where the default was determined by the
court.
October 15 2015
Knowing When to Quit:
Default Choices, Demographics and Fraud
• Details:
– In Feb 2008, while FTC vs. Suntasia case was in
court the firm was allowed to resume operations
under the condition that:
• Those who enrolled before Feb 1, 2007 will be sent an
“Enrollment Letter”. The default is to stay enrolled
• Those who enrolled after Feb 1 2007 will be sent a
“Cancellation Letter”. The default is to cancel
subscription.

October 15 2015
Knowing When to Quit:
Default Choices, Demographics and Fraud
• Contribution:
– Unlike in previous studies showing the effect of
defaults, there is no ambiguity of what is the
optimal decision for the individual.
– Hence, it shows that even in a very simple
decision making environment, where optimal
action is clear, defaults still have a very strong
effect.
– …and much more effective than an alternative
that requires taking only a very easy action.
October 15 2015
Knowing When to Quit:
Default Choices, Demographics and Fraud
• Comments:
– The hazard rate is such that most people cancel in
the first two months.
– Hence, the studied group of individuals may be
different than the overall population.
• Possibly the estimated effect is exaggerated.
• The others may have been more responsive taking an
action followed by an “Enrollment” letter.
October 15 2015
Knowing When to Quit:
Default Choices, Demographics and Fraud
– Staying enrolled for so long may be for very different
reasons for low SES and high SES:
• Low SES: may stay enrolled because they did not
understand that they can cancel; a letter mentioning a
lawsuit could confuse some of them further, reducing
their chance of cancellation
• High SES: may stay enrolled since they do not pay
attention. If this is indeed case, the enrollment letter
would lead to higher cancellation rate among this group
• Can you think of measures of attention? If available, the
number of accounts cancelled may be helpful.

DARRYL: This is…the “Money Smart Podcast Network with Darryl and Terri.”
Music down
DARRYL: This podcast series was created to help you know more about money and banking.
We’re addressing some of your most pressing questions, and we’re talking to experts who can
help give us some answers and understanding.
TERRI: (from remote; breaking in) Hey, did you say “Darryl and Terri?”
DARRYL: (sound of him hurriedly turning off her microphone) Oooops. Oh what sorry Terri I
couldn’t hear you there, technical difficulties. Uh…so. We’ve been getting letters from listeners
like you asking for advice on some money-related matters. And we’re bringing in experts to
help us understand the topics and answer questions. (to Terri) Uh, Terri. Are you there?
TERRI: (somewhat mock annoyed) Well, I was. Until you shut off my mic. But, yes, I’m back
now.
DARRYL: I was just going to introduce the topic.
TERRI: That sounds like a good idea.
DARRYL: So today we’re beginning with a question we got from Marsha, a listener from
Eureka, California. She’s concerned about identity theft. Here’s what she said.
MARSHA: (playback of the message she left on the show’s voicemail; it should be read in a
slightly stilted manner, as a non-actor would when reading something out loud) “Dear Terri and
Darryl—”
DARRYL: (breaking in) She means, “Darryl and Terri.”
MARSHA: (playing back) “My wallet was stolen recently. I cancelled my credit cards as soon
as I noticed, and got new ones. Was that all I should have done? Plus, it started making me
really nervous about identity theft. What can I do to protect myself?”
DARRYL: Those are fantastic questions. To answer them, Terri is on a field trip to Marsha’s
hometown of Eureka, California, along with security consultant Antonia Lopez, an authority on
identity theft. (to Terri) Terri, are you there?
“Coffee house” sounds in the background throughout. We hear the clinking of cups, a barista’s
now-and-again faint calls of: “triple-foamed non-fat extra-hot raspberry espresso with a whip”
and so on
TERRI: Yup. Haven’t gone anywhere Darryl. (to listeners) So we’re visiting Marsha at what
we’re told is one of her favorite hangouts – the Caffeine Station. From the looks of it – and I
imagine the sound of it – it’s the favorite hangout of at least half of her college classmates, too.

1-3: HOW TO PROTECT YOUR IDENTITY
Initial sounds of Marsha typing on her laptop as Terri and Antonia go up to introduce
themselves.
TERRI: Good morning. Marsha? I’m Terri, from the “Money Smart Podcast Network.”
MARSHA: Yes, oh, wow – you’re from the radio! I didn’t expect you to come here!
TERRI: Well, here I am, and I’ve brought with me an expert to help you with your identity theft
questions. Do you have 10-15 minutes this morning to talk with us on the air?
MARSHA: Uh, I have to leave for class in about 15 minutes…
TERRI: That’s perfect, because you have the quick-witted, fast-talking half of our team here.
They laugh
TERRI: Marsha, this is Antonia Lopez. She was on the police identity theft teams of three cities
in Michigan and Illinois over the past 10 years. She worked alongside federal investigators on
some cases. Now she’s a private consultant who specializes in identity theft.
MARSHA: Hi!
ANTONIA: (it’s ok if Antonia sounds a little rough around the edges; she was a cop) It’s good
to meet you.
TERRI: Antonia’s going to help you and our listeners learn to protect ourselves.
ANTONIA: Basically, I’ve seen it all. All the tricks, all the tactics, you name it.
TERRI: Marsha, why don’t you start by telling Antonia what happened with your wallet.
MARSHA: Well, about two weeks ago I was sitting, uh… (her voice changes slightly, because
she’s craning her neck)…over there. On the green couch. I was working on a paper. I reached
into my purse for my wallet, and it wasn’t there. I looked all over. Gone.
ANTONIA: It can happen so fast, right? In the future, keep your purse on your lap, not beside
you, since it’s easy to be distracted.
TERRI: And men?
ANTONIA: It’s safer to carry wallets in an inner jacket pocket, or front pants pocket so it’s
harder for a thief to take.
ANTONIA: I was told that you cancelled your credit cards right away. Is that right, Marsha?
MARSHA: Yeah. And my ATM card, too. But whoever took it managed to charge $1,000 on
one of my debit cards anyway.

1-3: HOW TO PROTECT YOUR IDENTITY
ANTONIA: Well, you did the right thing. You need to notify those banks within two business
days. That way the most you might be responsible for is $50.
MARSHA: Wow! Fortunately they didn’t ask me to pay anything. What if you call them after
two days?
TERRI: You might lose up to $500, or perhaps much more.
MARSHA: No way!
TERRI: Let’s move on to identity theft.
ANTONIA: Right. If it was just your credit cards and ATM card and you cancel them right
away, that’s one thing. Think about what else was in your wallet. Did the thieves get other
personal information from your wallet like your birth date, social security number, or bank
account?
MARSHA: No, that day I just had my credit cards and some cash.
TERRI: That’s a relief!
ANTONIA: Good. I always recommend that people carry only what they need for the day. It’s
never a good idea to carry around your social security card. Keep it secured at home, along with
any credit cards you’re not using or put it in a safety deposit box. You need to be aware, though,
that this kind of information is very valuable to thieves. They can use it to open new accounts in
your name. And they’ll take it from anywhere they can, whether that’s your pocket or purse or
even from your mailbox. They will even go through your trash to find it.
MARSHA: Yuck!
ANTONIA: So don’t print your social security number on your checks, or use it on your driver’s
license. Also be careful with bank statements or any documents with personal information.
That’s what thieves are after in your trash.
TERRI: You know… I think Darryl’s favorite jacket came from a dumpster. There’s a reason
we leave him at the studio. Antonia, you had suggested I get a shredder.
ANTONIA: Yeah. That’s the best way to deal with bank statements or other mail that has your
social security number or your account number on it. File it safely if you need to keep it – and
shred it when you don’t. Make sure it’s a crosscut shredder. That makes it almost impossible to
put documents back together.
TERRI: To stop getting many of those credit card offers altogether, you can do what’s called
“Opt Out.”
MARSHA: What’s that?

1-3: HOW TO PROTECT YOUR IDENTITY
TERRI: It’s taking yourself off of the mailing list for offers of credit or insurance. It gives
thieves fewer opportunities to try to open a credit card in your name.
ANTONIA: That means your mailbox is less attractive to thieves.
MARSHA: That sounds good!
TERRI: It’s easy, too. Just call 1-888-OPT-OUT (1-888-567-8688) or fill out the form at
www.optoutprescreen.com.
ANTONIA: Marsha, the thief didn’t get a driver’s license from you, right?
MARSHA: Right.
ANTONIA: That’s also good. If he had, he’d know where you live. I would recommend that if
your mailbox didn’t have a lock, get one that does or get a post office box. Use direct deposit if
your employer offers it.
MARSHA: I guess I was really lucky!
TERRI: Definitely.
ANTONIA: And…and this has been bothering me since we came in. (hear “thud” sound of
Antonia closing Marsha’s laptop) Your private information can be stolen online if you’re using a
public computer, post the wrong information on social media, or respond to a fake e-mail or text
message.
MARSHA: Aw! But this is my own computer.
ANTONIA: But have you secured your computer by installing antivirus software and firewall
protection?
MARSHA: Yes!
ANTONIA: And do you have it set to update automatically?
MARSHA: Oh, I don’t think I do! And I was buying and downloading music here all the time!
TERRI: One big problem is a fake e-mail or text message that looks like it came from your bank
or credit card company – or even an online seller. It’ll usually say something like there’s a
problem, and you need to verify your account information, password, and credit card or they’ll
have to suspend your account.
ANTONIA: That’s called a “phishing” scam—
MARSHA: —as in…flounder?

TERRI: No, this phish is spelled with a “PH” at the beginning.
ANTONIA: It happens by phone, too. Another scam is pharming –
MARSHA: Let me guess: this farm has nothing to do with the place where they grow spinach.
TERRI: Correct. It’s also spelled with “PH” – I don’t know why they do that!
MARSHA: Phun times.
ANTONIA: Pharming is when the e-mail directs you to a website that looks like it belongs to an
online merchant or bank you do business with.
MARSHA: So how do you know if it’s real or phake? (to Terri) I said that with a “PH.”
ANTONIA: The big point is no real bank or business will ask for that kind of information in an
e-mail or a phone call. So don’t provide any information over the phone or e-mail. Don’t click
on any links, or open any attachments.
TERRI: If you’re unsure, you can call the bank’s customer service number listed on your credit
or debit card, which you know is real. That way you can make sure there are no issues with your
account.
ANTONIA: You can also contact the National Fraud Information Center by going to
www.fraud.org. That site lets you report suspicious e-mails and calls asking for personal
information. It has a lot of great information, too.
TERRI: For our listeners, are there other steps Marsha should have taken when her wallet was
stolen?
ANTONIA: Marsha, you were right to contact your credit card companies and report the stolen
cards. If any checks had been taken, you might have considered opening new checking and
savings accounts and stop payment on the missing checks. A new ATM card and PIN would be
a good idea.
MARSHA: Um…now that I’m thinking about it, I couldn’t find my driver’s license this
morning – maybe they did take it. I can get a duplicate, but…how do I know if someone is using
my information?
ANTONIA: First, if you haven’t reported the theft to police, do so and keep a copy of the police
report.
Next, be sure to look at all your bank and credit card statements as soon as they’re available.
Check for any purchases you didn’t make, or new credit cards or loans you didn’t request. If you
see anything suspicious, report it immediately to security or fraud department of your bank or
credit card company.

You also can contact a check verification company, who will notify stores not to accept the
stolen checks. Two that work with consumers are TeleCheck and Certegy.
TERRI: You can find specifics for those companies in the InfoBooth portion of the Money
Smart Podcast Network, at www.fdicmspodcast.com.
ANTONIA: Next, get and look at your credit reports. By law you can get a complete and free
credit report every twelve months from each of the three major credit reporting agencies. Those
are Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. You can request a report online at
www.annualcreditreport.com
TERRI: This information is also at www.fdicmspodcast.com.
MARSHA: Whoa, I’m getting a little lost.
ANTONIA: I’m going fast so you can get to class. Just remember that there’s complete
information on all this at www.fdic.gov, under the Consumer Protection section, so you can
follow up on everything.
TERRI: It is a good resource. Other questions, Marsha?
MARSHA: What do I do when I get my credit report?
ANTONIA: Check for any new loans or credit accounts that you didn’t request. If you see
anything suspicious, contact the fraud department of any of the credit reporting agencies. You
can find details at www.ftc.gov/idtheft. You’ll want an initial fraud alert placed in your credit
file; that alert will last for 90 days.
MARSHA: Ok.
ANTONIA: In fact, to be really safe, you can ask to have an initial fraud alert put on your file
even before you get your credit report. It tells potential creditors to take extra steps when you –
or someone pretending to be you – tries to open an account in your name.
TERRI: And there’s an extended fraud alert too, right?
ANTONIA: Right. Marsha, that’s if you become a victim of identity theft. It lasts for seven
years. Potential creditors have to take even more steps before they open an account for you.
TERRI: I know this isn’t your situation, Marsha, but I always like to tell people that if you know
any active military personnel, you should tell them about “active-duty alert.”
ANTONIA: Right. It tells potential creditors to take extra steps when opening accounts for
those on active military duty.
TERRI: We’re running out of time… any last advice for Marsha?

ANTONIA: Marsha, best of luck. And if you wind up talking to or corresponding with your
creditors, the police, or the credit reporting agencies, keep good records. And quickly complete
any of the steps you haven’t done – it can make a big difference in avoiding problems later.
MARSHA: Antonia and Terri, thank you so much!
TERRI: Antonia, thank you for sharing so much great information on identity theft.
ANTONIA: Any time.
