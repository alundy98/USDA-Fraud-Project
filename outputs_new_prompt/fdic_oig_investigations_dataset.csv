New Jersey Man Sentenced to Federal Prison for Fraudulently Obtaining Bank Loans Guaranteed by the Small Business Administration,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/new-jersey-man-sentenced-federal-prison-fraudulently-obtaining,"October 16, 2025",2025,"Baltimore, Maryland – U.S. District Judge Deborah K. Chasanow sentenced Mehul Ramesh Khatiwala, 43, aka “Mike Khatiwala,” of Voorhees, New Jersey, to seven years in federal prison, followed by five years of supervised release, in connection with his role supervising a multi-million-dollar bank fraud conspiracy.  Khatiwala and his co-conspirators schemed to fraudulently obtain more than $35 million in Small Business Administration (SBA) loans from financial institutions that they used in a hotel flipping scheme involving the purchase and sale of hotels.  Judge Chasanow also ordered Khatiwala to forfeit $6,000,000, pay restitution of $6,010,655.72, and pay a $100,000 fine.
This is Khatiwala’s second federal conviction and sentencing for bank fraud charges.  In April 2019, Khatiwala pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud and three counts of bank fraud involving criminal conduct dating back to about 2011 through about 2014. In April 2021, Judge Chasanow sentenced Khatiwala to multiple years of incarceration, ordered forfeiture and restitution, and a term of supervised release in connection with his criminal conduct from 2011 to 2014.
Kelly O. Hayes, U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland, announced the sentence with Special Agent in Charge Robert Manchak, Federal Housing Finance Agency Office of Inspector General (FHFA-OIG), and Special Agent in Charge Jeffrey D. Pittano, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC-OIG) – Mid-Atlantic Region.
According to the factual stipulations in his guilty plea, Khatiwala was the owner and managing member of Delaware Hotel Group LLC (DHG), and an operator of GMK Consulting LLC (GMK) and KPG Hotel Mgmt. LLC (KPG). These LLCs were hotel management and loan brokerage companies located in Mount Laurel, New Jersey. Co-defendant Rajendra G. Parikh, 64, of Monroe, New Jersey, was also an owner of KPG.  Co-defendant Jennifer Watkins, 48, of Marlton, New Jersey, served as a project coordinator for DHG and managing member of Forza Consulting LLC (Forza), a hotel consulting and loan brokerage company located in Marlton, New Jersey.  Co-defendant Rebecca Marie Cohn, 38, aka Rebecca Marie Stanton, was a settlement and title processor for Residential Title & Escrow Company, a real estate title company located in Owings Mills, Maryland, that offered escrow and loan-settlement services.
From August 2018 through February 2020, Khatiwala, Parikh, and Watkins conspired to obtain loan proceeds to buy and sell hotels in connection with a hotel-flipping scheme. “Flipping” is a real estate investment strategy that involves purchasing property to hold for a short period before selling it to make a quick profit.  During the SBA-loan application process, the co-conspirators made and caused others to make material misrepresentations and omissions to financial institutions regarding the sellers’ identity, familial relationships between parties, and the nature and amount of the equity injected by the borrowers.  The defendants sought loans through the SBA’s Section 7(a) Program, which guaranteed and insured approximately 75-85 percent of these loans, and required that the small business owner/borrower invest a certain amount of their own money into the business to qualify for the loan.
Khatiwala, Parikh, and Watkins admitted that they created shell companies using co-conspirators as straw owners of the entities.  These straw owners had no actual ownership interest in the entities as Khatiwala and Parikh were the true owners.  The straw owners signed purchase contracts, operating agreements, and related documents to buy hotel properties in the name of the shell companies.
The co-conspirators, supervised in part by Khatiwala, then created a second company to purchase the hotels from the shell companies at substantially higher prices.  After the co-conspirators formed the companies to control both sides of the flip transaction, they solicited banks for small-business loans to finance the buying company’s purchase of the hotel from the straw companies.  The co-conspirators helped the buying companies qualify for the loans by falsely representing investors’ equity injections to the banks, among other materially false statements, misrepresentations, and omissions.  The financial institutions extending the loans relied on the false statements and misrepresentations.
In July 2025, Judge Chasanow sentenced co-defendant Jennifer Watkins, 48, of Marlton, New Jersey, to 36 months in federal prison, followed by three years of supervised release, in connection with her role in the bank fraud conspiracy.  Co-defendant Rajendra G. Parikh is awaiting a sentencing date.
U.S. Attorney Hayes commended the FHFA-OIG, FDIC-OIG, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for their work in the investigation.  Ms. Hayes also thanked Assistant U.S. Attorneys Harry M. Gruber and Ari D. Evans, who are prosecuting the federal case, and recognized Paralegal Specialist Joanna B.N. Huber, who provided legal support for the case.

Startup CEO Charlie Javice Sentenced To 85 Months In Prison For $175 Million Fraud,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/startup-ceo-charlie-javice-sentenced-85-months-prison-175,"September 29, 2025",2025,"Attorney for the United States, Acting Under Authority Conferred by 28 U.S.C. § 515, Amanda Houle announced that CHARLIE JAVICE was sentenced today to 85 months in prison for falsely and dramatically inflating the number of customers of her company, Frank, to fraudulently induce J.P. Morgan Chase (“JPMC”) to acquire Frank for $175 million.  JAVICE and her co-defendant, OLIVIER AMAR, were convicted of conspiracy, wire fraud, bank fraud, and securities fraud following a six-week jury trial in March 2025. Today’s sentence was imposed by U.S. District Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein.
“Javice perpetrated a $175 million fraud—repeatedly lying about the success of her startup company and even hiring a data scientist to create fake data to back up her lies.  For that, Javice has been sentenced to 85 months’ imprisonment and ordered to pay over $300,000,000,” said Attorney for the United States Amanda Houle.  “Today’s sentence sends a clear message that brazen frauds will be met with serious penalties.  Our Office will continue to work tirelessly to hold accountable those who seek to profit through fraudulent schemes and lies.”
As set forth in public filings and the trial record:
In or about 2017, JAVICE founded Frank, a for-profit company that offered an online platform designed to simplify the process of filling out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (“FAFSA”).  FAFSA is a federal government form, available free of charge, that students use to apply for financial aid for college or graduate school.  JAVICE was Frank’s CEO.  AMAR was Frank’s Chief Growth Officer.
In or about 2021, JAVICE began to pursue the sale of Frank to a larger financial institution. Two major banks, one of which was JPMC, expressed interest and began acquisition processes with Frank.  JAVICE represented repeatedly to those banks that Frank had 4.25 million customers or “users.”  JAVICE explicitly defined “users”—to both banks—as individuals who had signed up for an account with Frank and for whom Frank therefore had at least four identified categories of data ( i.e. , first name, last name, email address, and phone number).  In fact, Frank had approximately 300,000 users.
When JPMC sought to verify the number of Frank’s users and the amount of data collected about them—information that was critical to JPMC’s decision to move forward with the acquisition process—JAVICE and AMAR fabricated a data set.  To do this, JAVICE and AMAR first asked Frank’s director of engineering to create an artificially generated (so-called “synthetic”) data set. The director of engineering raised concerns about the legality of the request, to which JAVICE responded, in substance and in part, “We don’t want to end up in orange jumpsuits.”  The director of engineering declined the request.
JAVICE then approached an outside data scientist and hired him to create the synthetic data set. After the data set was created, JAVICE provided that synthetic data set to an agreed-upon third-party vendor in an effort to confirm to JPMC that the data set had over 4.25 million rows.  JAVICE then caused the third-party vendor to convey to JPMC that the data set had over 4.25 million rows, consistent with JAVICE’s misrepresentations that Frank had 4.25 million users.
In reliance on JAVICE’s fraudulent representations about Frank’s users, JPMC agreed to purchase Frank for $175 million.  As part of the deal, JPMC hired JAVICE and other Frank employees.  JAVICE received over $21 million for selling her equity stake in Frank and, per the terms of the deal, was to be paid another $20 million as a retention bonus.
Unbeknownst to JPMC, at or about the same time that JAVICE was creating the fabricated data set, JAVICE and AMAR sought to purchase, on the open market, real data for over 4.25 million college students to cover up their misrepresentations.  JAVICE and AMAR succeeded in purchasing a data set of 4.5 million students for $105,000, but it did not contain all the data fields that JAVICE had represented to JPMC were maintained by Frank.  JAVICE then purchased an additional set of data on the open market to augment the data set of 4.5 million users.  After JPMC acquired Frank, JPMC employees asked JAVICE and AMAR to provide data relating to Frank’s users so that JPMC could begin a marketing campaign to those users.  In response, JAVICE provided what was supposedly Frank’s user data.  In fact, JAVICE fraudulently provided the data she and AMAR had purchased on the open market, at a small fraction of the price that JPMC paid to acquire Frank and its purported users.
*                      *                      *
In addition to the prison term, JAVICE, 31, of Miami Beach, Florida, was sentenced to three years of supervised release. The district court also imposed a forfeiture judgment of $22,360,977.48 and ordered restitution in the amount of $287,501,078.00 that is joint and several with AMAR.
Ms. Houle praised the outstanding investigative work of the Special Agents from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s Office of Inspector General.
The case is being handled by the Office’s Complex Frauds and Cybercrime Unit.  Assistant U.S. Attorneys Nicholas W. Chiuchiolo, Micah F. Fergenson, and Georgia V. Kostopoulos are in charge of the prosecution.

Center City Real Estate Agent Pleads Guilty to Charges Arising From Fraudulent Loan Scheme,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/center-city-real-estate-agent-pleads-guilty-charges-arising,"September 23, 2025",2025,"PHILADELPHIA – United States Attorney David Metcalf announced that Jonathan Barach, 46, of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, entered a plea of guilty today before United States District Judge Mia Roberts Perez to one count of wire fraud and one count of making an illegal monetary transaction, in connection with a fraudulent loan scheme in which he raised millions of dollars from individuals and businesses, purportedly for short-term real estate financing opportunities, when no such projects existed.
As detailed in the information filed August 21, 2025, the defendant served as a licensed residential real estate agent and the co-founder and principal agent for The Barach Group, LLC, a Philadelphia-based real estate team, and formed a second company, TBG Real Estate, LLC, also based in the city. In addition to offering traditional real estate agent services, Barach used his companies to solicit and raise money for non-existent real estate financing opportunities.
Between July 2017 and April 2021, Barach raised over $3 million from lenders through a series of material misrepresentations, including by falsely stating the raised funds would be used to provide bridge loans to builders and contractors looking to purchase and flip distressed real estate properties or to complete renovation projects. At the time of these solicitations, no such projects existed, Barach’s entities did not provide real estate financing, and Barach knew that the lenders’ funds would be used for his own purposes and debts.
None of the money raised by Barach from his victims was used for the stated purpose. Instead, Barach typically withdrew the funds in cash, made assorted personal expenditures, transferred funds to his personal bank accounts, and moved large sums to various accounts that he held with casinos and sportsbook operations. Although Barach paid back some of his earlier lenders with a portion of the funding secured from later lenders, over $1.4 million of the fraudulently obtained loan proceeds remain unpaid.
The defendant is scheduled to be sentenced on February 2, 2026, and faces a maximum possible term of 30 years’ imprisonment.
This case was investigated by the FDIC Office of Inspector General, IRS Criminal Investigation, and the FBI, with assistance from the U.S. Secret Service, and is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys Terri Marinari and Samuel Dalke.

Former Bank of O’Fallon executive sentenced to prison for swindling $2 million in check kiting fraud scheme,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/former-bank-ofallon-executive-sentenced-prison-swindling-2,"September 18, 2025",2025,"EAST ST. LOUIS, Ill. – A district judge sentenced the former second-in-command of the Bank of O’Fallon to 63 months’ imprisonment after he admitted to federal charges for engaging in a fraud scheme to obtain more than $2 million.
Andrew P. Blassie, 70, of St. Louis, pleaded guilty to one count of bank fraud and one count of interstate transportation of security or funds obtained by fraud. In addition to imprisonment, he was ordered to pay $2,461,887.67 in restitution.
“Blassie’s prison sentence underscores the severity of his crimes to betray his clients, employer, family, and community,” said U.S. Attorney Steven D. Weinhoeft. “The outstanding work by the investigators and the Bank of O’Fallon’s vital cooperation to dismantle this scheme delivered justice and helped to protect the integrity of our financial system.”
According to the indictment, Blassie served as the Executive Vice President for the Bank of O’Fallon and defrauded the bank out of $1,972,887.67 in a check kite scheme from September 2023 through September 2024 during his employment.
Blassie admitted to falsely inflating the balance of his personal checking account at the Bank of O’Fallon by depositing checks he knew to be backed by non-sufficient funds. He deposited checks with non-sufficient funds from four personal accounts at three other banks and one credit union into the Bank of O’Fallon account.
“The U.S. Secret Service is committed to pursuing criminal actors who seek to rip off law-abiding citizens and undermine our nation’s financial system in the process. This was an outrageous scheme that hurt innocent victims,” said acting Resident Agent in Charge David Bolin, of the U.S. Secret Service’s Springfield Resident Office. “I am proud of our agency’s work in this case. Thanks to the U.S. Attorney’s Office of the Southern District of Illinois as well as our federal and local law enforcement partners who helped to bring justice for the victims, including the O’Fallon Police Department.”
Blassie paid nearly $2.7 million for personal expenses from the falsely inflated account thus using funds belonging to the Bank of O’Fallon. As the former Executive Vice President, Blassie used his position to conceal his fraud from the Bank of O’Fallon by scrubbing his name and account number from suspected kiting reports.
“Today’s sentencing brings justice to the defendant, who violated his position of trust as Executive Vice President at the Bank of O’Fallon. He defrauded the bank of approximately $2 million through a check kiting scheme that he used to enrich himself,” said Special Agent in Charge Vincent R. Zehme, of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC OIG), Chicago Region. “This case exhibits the FDIC OIG’s steadfast commitment to working with our law enforcement partners to hold bank insiders, and other perpetrators of fraud, accountable for their role in such schemes, especially those that threaten the safety and soundness of our Nation’s financial institutions.”
From August 2022 through September 2024, Blassie also persuaded a couple from Lebanon, Illinois, to give him $489,000 of their retirement savings. In return for this investment, Blassie gave the couple two promissory notes. He agreed to pay the couple interest on the notes and used money he obtained through his check kite scheme to pay some of that interest.
As security for his promissory notes, Blassie pledged 128 of his and his wife’s shares of the holding company which owns the Bank of O’Fallon.
“Today’s sentencing holds accountable and brings to justice a former bank executive who abused his position to defraud Bank of O’Fallon and its customers,” said Don Daley, Acting Assistant Special Agent in Charge, Western Region, Office of Inspector General for the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. “We are proud to have worked with our law enforcement partners to achieve this result. We will continue to vigorously pursue those who undermine the safety and soundness of our banking institutions.”
According to the indictment, Blassie later sold most of these shares and did not use those funds to repay the Lebanon couple. This left the couple with no means of recourse when Blassie later defaulted on the promissory notes.
“Bank officials who abuse their positions of public trust for personal gain pose an unacceptable threat to the integrity the Federal Home Loan Bank system,” said Korey Brinkman, Special Agent in Charge of the Federal Housing Finance Agency Office of Inspector General’s Central Region.  “Today’s sentencing demonstrates our ongoing commitment to investigating thoroughly allegations of fraud involving bank officials and supporting the prosecution of those charged with these offenses.  We are proud to work with our investigative partners and the U.S. Attorney’s Office to ensure insider fraudsters are held accountable under the law.”
Officials with the Bank of O’Fallon have fully cooperated with law enforcement during the investigation.
The O’Fallon Police Department, U.S. Secret Service, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General, the Office of Inspector General for the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and the Federal Housing Finance Agency, Office of Inspector General made contributions to the investigation.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Zoe Gross prosecuted the case.

Construction Company CEO Arrested for Amassing Real Estate Empire Through $4 Million in Fraudulently Obtained Covid-19 Relief Loans,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/construction-company-ceo-arrested-amassing-real-estate-empire,"September 5, 2025",2025,"A Visalia construction company CEO was arrested today on a federal criminal complaint alleging that he fraudulently obtained more than $4 million in taxpayer-funded COVID-19 relief funds and federally guaranteed small business loans, U.S. Attorney Eric Grant announced.
According to court documents, between April and June 2020, Joey Wayne Mackey, 45, of Visalia, submitted fraudulent Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan applications for three of his companies: Forcum-Mackey Construction Inc., a general contractor based in Ivanhoe; JWM Inc., a purported construction consulting company for which Mackey is the sole proprietor based in Mackey’s Visalia home; and Mack Aviation LLC, a provider of refueling and hangar‑rental services for charter jets at Visalia Municipal Airport.
All three of these applications contained fraudulent numbers of employees and monthly payroll cost calculations, which caused a bank, serving as a lending partner funding the COVID-19 relief through guaranteed small business loans, to disburse $4,082,550 in funds it otherwise would not have given. Over the following months, Mackey laundered the PPP loan funds through fraudulent payroll payments to family members (including his minor children), while Mackey controlled the bank accounts of those family members. In October 2020, Mackey then pulled the funds out of the family member accounts to buy revenue-generating real estate acquisitions, such as office parks and luxury apartment complexes from which he enriched himself further through rent payments from tenants. Mackey continued making real estate investments and luxury goods purchases traceable to PPP funds through at least 2023.
This case is the product of an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General, and the Small Business Administration Office of Inspector General. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Calvin Lee and Kevin Khasigian are prosecuting the case.
If convicted, Mackey faces a maximum statutory penalty of 30 years in prison and a $1 million fine. Any sentence, however, would be determined at the discretion of the court after consideration of any applicable statutory factors and the federal Sentencing Guidelines, which take into account a number of variables. The charges are only allegations; the defendant is presumed innocent until and unless proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
This effort is part of a California COVID-19 Fraud Enforcement Strike Force operation, one of five interagency COVID-19 fraud strike force teams established by the U.S. Department of Justice. The California Strike Force combines law enforcement and prosecutorial resources in the Eastern and Central Districts of California and focuses on large-scale, multistate pandemic relief fraud perpetrated by criminal organizations and transnational actors. The strike forces use prosecutor-led and data analyst-driven teams to identify and bring to justice those who stole pandemic relief funds.

California Man Pleads Guilty for Role in $15.9M COVID-19 Fraud Scheme,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/california-man-pleads-guilty-role-159m-covid-19-fraud-scheme,"August 25, 2025",2025,"A California man pleaded guilty yesterday for his role in a scheme to defraud the Small Business Administration (SBA) out of $15.9 million in loans through the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) and Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) programs.
“The defendant orchestrated a scheme where he worked with purported business owners to submit dozens of loan applications to steal millions of dollars of Covid-19 relief funds,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Matthew R. Galeotti of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. “The defendant’s egregious scheme relied on layers of deception to steal taxpayer money to buy himself luxury vehicles, residential properties, and jewelry. The Criminal Division remains dedicated to holding fraudsters who steal from the public fisc to account for their greed.”
“The defendant in this case fraudulently obtained $15.9 million from federal funding programs intended to provide government relief to businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic and instead diverted vital relief funds for his own personal benefit,” said Special Agent in Charge Tyler Hatcher of the IRS Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI) Los Angeles Field Office. “IRS-CI is proud to partner with our federal law enforcement organizations to investigate and ensure relief funds are spent in accordance with their original intended purposes.""
“Exploiting pandemic relief meant for struggling Americans is not only morally reprehensible, it’s a betrayal of public trust,” said Assistant Director Jose A. Perez of the FBI Criminal Investigative Division. “This defendant orchestrated a multimillion-dollar fraud scheme, weaponizing federal COVID-19 assistance programs for his personal gain. The FBI will always work to make sure those who steal from programs designed to help others are held accountable.”
“The defendant in this case submitted dozens of fraudulent loan applications to obtain millions of dollars from government programs designed to assist struggling businesses during the pandemic,” said Special Agent in Charge Patricia Tarasca of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC OIG), New York Region. “Today's guilty plea brings him to justice. The FDIC OIG remains committed to working with our law enforcement partners to hold accountable those who stole from COVID-19 relief programs in order to enrich themselves, and threatened the stability of our Nation's financial system.”
“Providing false information to gain access to SBA programs intended for disaster victims is unacceptable,” said Acting Special Agent in Charge Jonathan Huang of the Small Business Association Office of Inspector General’s (SBA-OIG) Western Region. “OIG is focused on rooting out bad actors in these vital SBA programs. I want to thank the Department of Justice, and our law enforcement partners for their dedication and commitment to seeing justice served.”
According to court documents, from April 2020 to April 2022, Emanuel Tucker, 45, of Canyon Lake, California, and other co-conspirators, submitted several dozen fraudulent PPP and EIDL loan applications on behalf of various companies that he owned and controlled. These applications contained material misrepresentations about the companies, including the number of employees, average monthly payroll, gross revenue, cost of goods, and supporting documents. The defendant used the fraudulently obtained funds to purchase a variety of luxury items, such as a Cadillac Escalade, a Bently Continental, and a Ferrari F8 Tributo, multiple million-dollar houses, and various jewelry, including a $63,000 diamond ring and a $400,000 diamond necklace.
Tucker pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud and bank fraud. Tucker faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison, and sentencing is scheduled for Dec. 4. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.
The IRS-CI, FBI, SBA-OIG, FDIC OIG, Federal Reserve Board Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Office of Inspector General, Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, and Department of Energy Office of Inspector General are investigating the case.

Man Sentenced for Over $11M COVID-19 Relief Fraud and Money Laundering Scheme,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/man-sentenced-over-11m-covid-19-relief-fraud-and-money,"August 21, 2025",2025,"A Nevada man was sentenced today to over 15 years in prison and five years of supervised release for fraudulently obtaining more than $11 million in Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (SBA) under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act and then laundering the funds through real estate transactions, gambling activity, and luxury purchases. The defendant was also ordered to pay restitution in the amount of $11,793,064.15, forfeiture in the amount of $11,231,186.52, and to forfeit two vehicles and five properties.
“This defendant stole more than $11 million in taxpayer funds that he used to finance luxury purchases and gambling,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Matthew R. Galeotti of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. “Prosecuting schemes like this is critical to protecting the contributions of hard-working Americans, preserving confidence in government relief programs, and ensuring that aid reaches those who truly need it. This sentence demonstrates the Criminal Division’s continuing commitment to protecting the public’s money from thieves and fraudsters.”
“The consequences of the defendant’s PPP loan fraud scheme have caught up with him and now he will be incarcerated for exploiting more than $11.2 million from a taxpayer-funded program,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Sigal Chattah for the District of Nevada. “Thanks to the diligent work of our law enforcement partners, the defendant is being held accountable for defrauding the government.”
“This lengthy sentence shows how seriously the American government takes PPP loan fraud,” said Special Agent in Charge Carissa Messick of IRS Criminal Investigation’s (IRS-CI) Phoenix Field Office. “This loan program was created to support small businesses and their employees during a once in a lifetime pandemic. When Mr. Dezfooli fraudulently obtained these loans, he not only stole from the Small Business Administration, but also from American taxpayers to the tune of $11.2 million. This sentencing is a testament to IRS-CI’s dedication to protecting American taxpayers and ensuring the integrity of our tax system.”
“Today’s sentencing holds accountable and brings to justice a fraudster who stole millions of taxpayer dollars intended to help small business owners,” said Special Agent in Charge Jon Ellwanger of the Office of Inspector General for the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Western Region. “We are proud to have worked with our federal law enforcement partners and the U.S. Attorney’s Office to achieve this result.”
“Mr. Dezfooli falsified loan applications to fraudulently obtain PPP loan proceeds that he used to enrich himself to the detriment of legitimate business struggling during the pandemic,” said Special Agent in Charge Ryan Korner of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC-OIG). “The defendant’s actions not only defrauded the PPP loan program but also disadvantaged business owners who were actually entitled to the benefits. FDIC OIG is committed to working alongside our law enforcement partners to protect the Nation’s Financial System and hold accountable those individuals, like Mr. Dezfooli, who steal benefits designated to help those in need.”
According to evidence presented at trial, Meelad Dezfooli, of Henderson, Nevada, submitted three fraudulent applications on behalf of entities he controlled, obtaining more than $11 million. Dezfooli supported these applications with false documents, including fabricated tax records and a utility bill, and grossly inflated the number of employees and payroll expenses of each entity.
After receiving the PPP funds, Dezfooli laundered the money by purchasing approximately 25 properties in Nevada, often using the alias “James Dez” or a fictitious entity called “Holdings Trust.” Even after he was indicted, Dezfooli continued laundering money, including selling property purchased with the illegally obtained PPP funds. He also used criminal proceeds to fund his personal investment account, buy luxury cars, and gamble extensively throughout Las Vegas. As part of this investigation, five homes were seized by law enforcement.
On Sept. 4, 2024, a jury found Dezfooli guilty of three counts of bank fraud, three counts of money laundering, and four counts of conducting transactions using criminally derived property. One of those violations related to a transaction that Dezfooli conducted after he had already been charged.
The IRS-CI, FRB-OIG, FDIC-OIG, and SBA-OIG investigated the case.

Former First Community Bank Vice President Sentenced to Five Years in Prison for Embezzlement Scheme,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/former-first-community-bank-vice-president-sentenced-five-years,"August 12, 2025",2025,"HUNTSVILLE, Ala. – A Cullman woman has been sentenced for her involvement in an embezzlement scheme, announced U.S. Attorney Prim F. Escalona.
U.S. District Court Judge Liles C. Burke sentenced Kellie L. Johnson, 54, of Cullman, Alabama, to 60 months in prison followed by 60 months supervised release. In May, Johnson pleaded guilty to bank embezzlement.
According to the plea agreement, Johnson was employed with First Community Bank for approximately 25 years. Between July 2013 and June 2023, Johnson embezzled money from First Community Bank’s Federal Reserve account to pay personal expenses, primarily credit card bills.  To conceal her scheme, Johnson falsified transactions to reconcile the balance of the Federal Reserve account in the bank’s general ledger and deleted her ACH transactions. Johnson also altered account statements sent by the Federal Reserve that she was required to provide to the bank president, auditors, and others. The scheme ended when the bank president received a call from the Federal Reserve notifying him that the bank’s ACH account was overdrawn. When the bank president asked Johnson to provide the latest account statement, she provided a fraudulent statement showing a positive balance in the account. Over the decade that she stole money from the bank, Johnson conducted approximately 273 fraudulent ACH transactions totaling over $2.3 million.  Additionally, Johnson deprived the bank of $138,185.40 in interest income to the Federal Reserve account.
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation investigated the case. Assistant U.S. Attorney Laura D. Hodge prosecuted the case.

Two Mexican Nationals Charged for Bribing State-Owned Energy Officials,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/two-mexican-nationals-charged-bribing-state-owned-energy,"August 11, 2025",2025,"Defendants Residing in Texas Allegedly Bribed PEMEX to Obtain Lucrative Contracts
An indictment was unsealed today in the Southern District of Texas charging two Mexican businessmen for their roles in an alleged bribery scheme to retain and obtain business related to Petróleos Mexicanos (PEMEX), the state-owned oil company of Mexico, and PEMEX Exploración y Producción (PEP), PEMEX’s wholly owned exploration and production subsidiary.
“The defendants — foreign nationals residing in the U.S. — are alleged to have bribed Mexican officials in order to rig the bidding process to secure millions of dollars of lucrative contracts and other advantages,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Matthew R. Galeotti of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. “This indictment should send a clear message that the Criminal Division will not tolerate those who enrich corrupt officials for personal gain and to the detriment of the fair market.”
“Bribery harms fair competition, erodes public trust, and will not be tolerated,” said Assistant Director Jose A. Perez of the FBI Criminal Investigation Division. “Today’s indictment underscores the commitment of the FBI, and our law enforcement partners, to fairness for communities in Texas and beyond.”
According to court documents, Ramon Alexandro Rovirosa Martinez, 46, of The Woodlands, Texas, a Mexican citizen and U.S. lawful permanent resident, and Mario Alberto Avila Lizarraga, 61, of Spring, Texas, a Mexican citizen and U.S. lawful permanent resident, together with others, allegedly conspired to pay and offered to pay at least $150,000 in bribes to officials at PEMEX and PEP in order to obtain and retain business from PEMEX and PEP for companies associated with Rovirosa.
Between at least 2019 and continuing into at least 2021, Rovirosa, Avila, and their co-conspirators allegedly offered to pay and paid bribes in the form of luxury goods, including from Louis Vuitton and Hublot, cash payments, and other valuable items, to at least three PEMEX and PEP officials in exchange for those officials taking certain actions to help companies associated with Rovirosa obtain and retain business with PEMEX and PEP. Those improper advantages helped companies associated with Rovirosa obtain contracts with PEMEX and PEP worth at least $2.5 million.
Rovirosa and Avila are each charged with one count of conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and three substantive violations of the FCPA. If convicted, each defendant faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison for each count. A federal judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors. Following his arrest, Rovirosa was arraigned today. Avila is a fugitive and remains at large.
The FBI and HSI are investigating the case, with assistance from the Office of the Inspector General for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The Justice Department’s Office of International Affairs provided critical assistance in this case.
Trial Attorneys Lindsey D. Carson, Abdus Samad Pardesi, and Paul G. Ream of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Brad Gray for the Southern District of Texas are prosecuting the case.

Sacramento Woman Sentenced to 4 Years in Prison for Benefit Fraud Scheme During Pandemic,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/sacramento-woman-sentenced-4-years-prison-benefit-fraud-scheme,"August 7, 2025",2025,"Tabitha Leigh Markle, 53, of Sacramento, was sentenced today to four years and two months in prison for mail fraud and aggravated identity theft in a scheme to defraud the unemployment insurance benefit program during the COVID-19 pandemic, Acting U.S. Attorney Kimberly A. Sanchez announced.
“Today’s sentencing highlights the U.S. Attorney’s Office’s continuing efforts to actively prosecute fraud against the unemployment insurance program that served as a lifeline for millions during the pandemic,” said U.S. Attorney Sanchez. “We are committed to ensuring unemployment benefits go to the unemployed who need the assistance, not to thieves who believe they are above the law.”
“Tabitha Markle unlawfully obtained over $2.5 million in COVID-19 pandemic-related unemployment insurance benefits by using the personal identifying information of other people, including several inmates in California state prisons, to file fraudulent claims. She falsified employment records to make it appear that the claimants were eligible for benefits when, in fact, they were not. Many of these individuals were unwitting participants in her scheme. The illegally obtained unemployment insurance funds, which Markle used for personal gain, were intended to support American workers facing economic hardship during an unprecedented public health crisis,” said Quentin Heiden, Special Agent-in-Charge, Western Region, U.S. Department of Labor, Office of Inspector General.
According to court documents, between April 2020 and January 2021, Markle defrauded the California Employment Development Department (EDD) and the United States out of unemployment insurance benefits. Markle collected personally identifiable information (PII) including names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers and other information, and submitted fraudulent applications for unemployment insurance (UI) benefits to EDD. Markle and her associates caused the UI debit cards to be mailed to addresses she listed in the fraudulent applications. They used the cards that were issued in the names of the supposed beneficiaries to withdraw cash from ATMs throughout California. Markle and her associates often appeared in ATM surveillance photos taking out large amounts of cash from the cards. Markle and her criminal associates obtained approximately $2,599,038 from the fraud.
Markle also used the means of identification of various victims, including one victim, who was a resident of Oakland. Without the victim’s knowledge or permission, Markle filed a false unemployment insurance application with California EDD using the victim’s true name and other identifying information, but using a false email address, phone number and mailing address. Markle’s associates withdrew thousands of dollars of unemployment insurance benefits from the card issued to the victim.
This case was the product of an investigation by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General, California EDD – Investigation Division, and the United States Department of Labor Office of Inspector General. Assistant U.S. Attorney Dhruv Sharma prosecuted the case.
This effort is part of a California COVID-19 Fraud Enforcement Strike Force operation, one of five interagency COVID-19 fraud strike force teams established by the U.S. Department of Justice. The California Strike Force combines law enforcement and prosecutorial resources in the Eastern and Central Districts of California and focuses on large-scale, multistate pandemic relief fraud perpetrated by criminal organizations and transnational actors. The strike forces use prosecutor-led and data analyst-driven teams to identify and bring to justice those who stole pandemic relief funds.

Two Defendants Charged In Investment Fraud Scheme With Over One Hundred Victims,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/two-defendants-charged-investment-fraud-scheme-over-one-hundred,"August 5, 2025",2025,"United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Jay Clayton; Special Agent in Charge of the New York Field Office of Homeland Security Investigations (“HSI”), Ricky J. Patel; Special Agent in Charge of the New York Regional Office of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s Office of the Inspector General (“FDIC-OIG”), Patricia Tarasca; and Acting Inspector in Charge of the New York Division of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service (“USPIS”), Edward Gallashaw, announced today the unsealing of an Indictment charging LOURDES ROSALES BANEGAS and RAMON CONCEPCION with stealing more than one million dollars from over one hundred victims through an investment fraud scheme known as “LNJ Funds.”  BANEGAS is also charged with sending proceeds from the scheme to bank accounts in Colombia.  The defendants were arrested and will be presented today before U.S. Magistrate Judge Robert W. Lehrburger.
“As alleged, Lourdes Rosales Banegas and Ramon Concepcion defrauded over one hundred victims through false promises about high and safe returns on their investments,” said U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton.  “But, Banegas and Concepcion selfishly spent their victims’ money on themselves.  Our office is committed to bringing those who prey on Main Street investors to justice.”
“As alleged, the defendants fleeced over a hundred innocent victims out of millions of dollars through their sham claims of a ‘risk-free’ money-making opportunity,” said HSI Special Agent in Charge Ricky J. Patel.  “Their alleged Ponzi scheme crumbled today, as did any façade of legitimacy behind their purported investment firm, LNJ Funds.  Every day, HSI New York stands alongside our law enforcement partners in utilizing every tool at our disposal to ensure New Yorkers as well as those around the world, and their livelihoods, are protected from criminal opportunists’ intent on filling their pockets by any means necessary.""
“The defendants allegedly made false promises as part of an investment scam involving more than 100 victims and enriched themselves while doing so,” said FDIC-OIG Special Agent in Charge Patricia Tarasca.  “Despite assurances that their victims could eventually recover their invested money, this did not prove to be the case.  We are pleased to join our law enforcement partners in bringing the perpetrators of such deceit to justice.”
“The U.S. Postal Inspection Service will continue to investigate investment schemes such as this and hold those who seek to defraud the American public accountable,” said USPIS Acting Inspector in Charge Edward Gallashaw.  “Before investing, individuals should research all claims and promises of high returns made by investment companies.  Too often, victims are enticed by bold promises and overlook warning signs that something may be off.”
According to allegations in the Indictment: [1]
BANEGAS and CONCEPCION marketed and operated a supposed investment business they called “LNJ Funds.”  BANEGAS and CONCEPCION told their victims that investments in LNJ Funds provided a guaranteed 20% rate of return every sixty days and that there was no risk of losing money in the investment.  BANEGAS and CONCEPCION claimed that LNJ Funds could offer risk-free investments because it invested money in student loans backed by the federal government.  BANEGAS and CONCEPCION also told their investors that they could withdraw their money from LNJ Funds after a waiting period of approximately 60 to 90 days.
Contrary to BANEGAS and CONCEPCION’s promises, LNJ Funds did not invest the money that its prospective investors provided.  Instead, BANEGAS and CONCEPCION spent money from their victim-investors on airfare, hotels, retail stores, and personal expenses.  BANEGAS also sent money to several bank accounts in Colombia, including an account in her name, as well as other accounts under her control.  Additionally, at times money from some LNJ Funds investors was paid to other LNJ Funds investors to perpetuate the myth that LNJ Funds was a legitimate business rather than a scam.
While BANEGAS and CONCEPCION told LNJ Funds investors that they could obtain a return of their invested money after a waiting period, BANEGAS and CONCEPCION did not maintain enough money to repay their investors.  Instead, BANEGAS and CONCEPCION stole and misused the investor money.  Moreover, instead of repaying their investors as promised, BANEGAS, CONCEPCION, and a co-conspirator insulted, ignored, and lied to victims who attempted to withdraw their money from LNJ Funds.
*                *                *
BANEGAS, 43, and CONCEPCION, 43, both of Queens, New York, are each charged with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. BANEGAS is also charged with three counts of engaging in monetary transactions in property derived from specified unlawful activity, each of which carries a maximum of 10 years in prison.
The maximum potential sentences in this case are prescribed by Congress and provided here for informational purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendants will be determined by a judge.
Mr. Clayton praised the outstanding work of HSI, FDIC-OIG, and USPIS.
The case is being handled by the Office’s Illicit Finance and Money Laundering Unit.  Assistant U.S. Attorney Christopher Brumwell is in charge of the prosecution, with the assistance of Paralegal Specialist Angelica Cotto.

New Jersey Woman Sentenced in Connection With Scheme to Fraudulently Obtain Loans From Small Business Administration,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/new-jersey-woman-sentenced-connection-scheme-fraudulently-obtain,"July 25, 2025",2025,"Baltimore , Maryland – U.S. District Judge Deborah K. Chasanow sentenced Jennifer Watkins, 48, of Marlton, New Jersey, to 36 months in federal prison, followed by three years of supervised release, in connection with her role as a co-conspirator in a multi-million-dollar bank fraud conspiracy. Watkins and her co-conspirators schemed to fraudulently obtain more than $35 million in Small Business Administration (SBA) loans from financial institutions that they used to purchase hotels. Judge Chasanow also ordered Watkins to pay restitution of $6,010,655.72.
Kelly O. Hayes, U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland, announced the sentence with Special Agent in Charge Robert Manchak, Federal Housing Finance Agency Office of Inspector General (FHFA-OIG), and Special Agent in Charge Jeffrey D. Pittano, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC-OIG) – Mid-Atlantic Region.
According to the factual stipulations in the guilty pleas of Watkins, and co-conspirators Mehul Ramesh Khatiwala, aka “Mike Khatiwala,” 43, of Voorhees, New Jersey, and Rajendra G. Parikh, 64, of Monroe, New Jersey, Khatiwala was the owner and managing member of Delaware Hotel Group LLC (DHG), and an operator of GMK Consulting LLC (GMK) and KPG Hotel Mgmt. LLC (KPG). These LLCs were hotel management and loan broker companies located in Mount Laurel, New Jersey.  Watkins served as a project coordinator for DHG and managing member of Forza Consulting LLC (Forza), a hotel consulting and loan broker company located in Marlton, New Jersey.  Parikh was an owner of KPG.  Co-defendant Rebecca Marie Cohn a/k/a Rebecca Marie Stanton, 38, was a settlement and title processor for Residential Title & Escrow Company, a real estate title company located in Owings Mills, Maryland, that offered escrow and loan-settlement services.
The guilty pleas outline how from August 2018 through February 2020, Khatiwala, Parikh, and Watkins conspired to obtain loan proceeds to buy and sell hotels in connection with a hotel flipping scheme. “Flipping” is a real estate investment strategy that involves purchasing property to hold for a short period before selling it to make a quick profit.  During the SBA-loan application process, the co-conspirators made and caused others to make material misrepresentations and omissions to financial institutions regarding the sellers’ identity, familial relationships between parties, and the nature and amount of the equity injected by the borrowers.  The defendants sought loans through the SBA’s Section 7(a) Program, which guaranteed and insured approximately 75-85 percent of these loans, and required that the small business owner/borrower invest a certain amount of their own money into the business to qualify for the loan.
In their guilty pleas, Khatiwala and Parikh admitted that they acted as managers or supervisors in connection with the scheme.  Additionally, Khatiwala, Parikh, and Watkins admitted that they created shell companies using co-conspirators as straw owners of the entities.  These straw owners had no actual ownership interest in the entities as Khatiwala and Parikh were the true owners.  The straw owners signed purchase contracts, operating agreements, and related documents to buy hotel properties in the name of the shell companies.
Co-conspirators then created a second company to purchase the hotels from the shell companies at substantially higher prices.  After the co-conspirators formed the companies to control both sides of the flip transaction, they solicited banks for small-business loans to finance the buying company’s purchase of the hotel from the straw companies.  The co-conspirators helped the buying companies qualify for the loans by falsely representing investors’ equity injections to the banks, among other materially false statements, misrepresentations, and omissions.  The financial institutions extending the loans relied on the false statements and misrepresentations.
U.S. Attorney Hayes commended the FHFA-OIG and FDIC-OIG for their work in the investigation.  Ms. Hayes also thanked Assistant U.S. Attorneys Harry M. Gruber, Evelyn L. Cusson, and Ari D. Evans, who are prosecuting the federal case, and recognized Paralegal Specialist Joanna B.N. Huber, who provided legal support for the case.

Former bank insider pleads guilty to stealing money from customer accounts,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/former-bank-insider-pleads-guilty-stealing-money-customer,"July 22, 2025",2025,"RICHMOND, Va. – A South Chesterfield woman pled guilty today to embezzling funds from and making false statements to her former employer, Truist Financial Corporation.
According to court documents, Ahshah Dior Martin, 35, repeatedly stole customer banking information to enrich herself.
In 2023, Martin began improperly using her access to Truist computer systems to gather Truist account holders’ banking information. Then, she initiated fraudulent debits and withdrawals from these accounts for her own benefit. For instance, Martin repeatedly initiated payments from customer bank accounts to a child support payment processor, through which Martin paid herself. In all, Martin used her access to sensitive customer financial information to steal $195,000 from at least 70 separate Truist customer accounts.
Martin stole from the Truist accounts of individuals and entities, including multiple churches, a children’s museum, an eye tissue bank non-profit organization, manufacturing and construction companies, a small business making customized holsters, and the North Carolina Wing of the Civil Air Patrol. Martin spent stolen funds on cosmetic products, clothing, travel expenses, dining, and at a hookah bar.
On April 15, 2024, Martin was terminated by Truist. Despite repeated attempts to retrieve her Truist laptop, Martin retained access to her work computer. To conceal her wrongdoing and prevent the return of her Truist laptop, Martin faked her own death. On April 17, 2024, in response to an email from Truist asking for the computer, Martin responded, “Sorry to inform you, she has passed away.”
Martin is scheduled to be sentenced on Nov. 20 and faces up to 30 years in prison. Actual sentences for federal crimes are typically less than the maximum penalties. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.

Barbier sentenced MMI to pay $15,745,846.10 in fines and restitution, a sum that MMI paid on the day of sentencing as part of its plea agreement in this case.
According to court documents, MMI was the management company and affiliate of Murex LLC, a privately-owned ethanol marketing and logistics company.  Another company, named as “Company A” in court records, was the U.S.-based subsidiary of a separate, foreign publicly traded company that operated ethanol production plants.
Beginning in 2013, Company A and its parent companies, began to experience financial stress.  In order to ameliorate cash flow issues and to manufacture additional financing for its debts, Company A initiated a strategy called “buy/sells” and approached MMI to assist in this strategy.  Company A’s plan called for Company A and MMI , through its affiliate, to create fictitious invoices purporting to be sales of ethanol between the two companies, which could then be sold as accounts receivable to unwitting buyers via a New Orleans-based online marketplace.  This strategy would provide cash flow for Company A and a profit to MMI . Although these invoices purported to show the bona fide sale of ethanol between MMI and Company A, in fact, no ethanol was exchanged between the companies through these transactions.  The unwitting buyers of these fraudulent accounts receivable included FDIC-insured financial institutions like First NBC Bank.
In plea documents, MMI admitted that, between October 28, 2013, and September 18, 2015, Company A and MMI conducted approximately $1.2 billion in fraudulent “buy/sell” transactions, with MMI making a profit of approximately $6,073,049.  Company A eventually defaulted on paying financial institutions for the accounts receivable that had been posted for auction by MMI .  The defaulted auctions caused a loss of approximately $73,073,683.05 to First NBC Bank, and a loss of approximately $8,330,427.02 to a North Carolina-based bank.
As part of MMI’s plea agreement, it agreed to a fine of $6,073,049.24.  Furthermore, MMI agreed as part of its plea to pay $4,263,145.30 in restitution to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as Receiver for First NBC Bank, as well as $5,409,651.56 to the successor of the North Carolina-based bank that also purchased the false accounts receivables. MMI was also ordered to pay a $400.00 mandatory special assessment fee.
“The conclusion of this case sends a clear message”, said Acting U.S. Attorney Michael M. Simpson.  “Entities that engage in fraudulent schemes to manipulate and damage the security of our nation's banking system will be held accountable.  Along with our federal, state and local investigative partners, our office will continue to investigate and prosecute financial corruption-wherever it may be uncovered in the Eastern District of Louisiana”.
“The FDIC OIG is pleased to join our law enforcement partners in announcing today’s guilty plea, and we remain committed to investigating and holding accountable corporate offenders who defraud our insured financial institutions and cause harm to our nation’s banking industry,” said Robert De Los Santos, Acting Special Agent in Charge, Dallas Region, Office of Inspector General for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
“The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Criminal Investigation Division is proud to have played a key role in this collaborative effort, which resulted in more than $15 million in restitution and penalties,” said Special Agent in Charge Kimberly Bahney of EPA’s Southwest Branch.  “Working alongside the FDIC OIG and our law enforcement partners, we remain committed to holding accountable those who defraud the government and undermine the integrity of the renewable fuels program.”
Acting U.S. Attorney Simpson praised the work of the FDIC Office of Inspector General, Dallas Field Office, and the Environmental Protection Agency, Criminal Investigation Division, Houston Resident Office, that investigated this matter.  Assistant United States Attorneys Matthew R. Payne of the Financial Crimes Unit and Nicholas D. Moses, Healthcare Fraud Coordinator, handled this prosecution.

Ponte Vedra Beach Man Pleads Guilty In Fraud Scheme Involving COVID-19 Personal Protective Equipment,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/ponte-vedra-beach-man-pleads-guilty-fraud-scheme-involving-covid,"July 10, 2025",2025,"Jacksonville, Florida – United States Attorney Gregory W. Kehoe announces that James Elliott Davis, II (36, Ponte Vedra Beach) has pleaded guilty to bank fraud, wire fraud, money laundering, and theft of mail. Davis faces up to 30 years in federal prison on the bank fraud count, up to 20 years in prison on the wire fraud count, up to 10 years in prison on the money laundering count, up to 5 years in prison on the theft of mail count and payment of restitution to the victims he defrauded. Davis has agreed to forfeit between $6.7 and $8.8 million, which are traceable to proceeds of the crimes he committed. No sentencing date has been set.
According to court documents, from March 2018 through 2022, Davis ran a purported medical supply company named Medisale Inc. Using false representations, Davis enticed individuals and business entities to invest large sums of money in Medisale. He falsely represented to victim-investors that Medisale was making significant profits on the sale of COVID-19 Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). He claimed to have contact with CEOs at various hospitals and that Medisale had contracts with hospitals to sell large volumes of N95 masks and other PPE. In convincing victim-investors to give him money, Davis showed fraudulent bank statements with large balances, claiming the money was from the sale of PPE.
In reality, Medisale had no such contracts and had no true revenue from the sale of PPE. Instead, Davis kited checks and conducted fraudulent ACH/wire transfers between multiple financial institutions in order to artificially inflate the apparent balances on his bank accounts. Utilizing victim-investor funds, Davis paid off previous debts, paid other investors purported profits from the sale of PPE, and paid personal expenses. This included Davis using victim-investor money to purchase a membership at a luxury club in Ponte Vedra Beach and spending more than $27,000 on custom clothing.
This case was investigated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation - Office of Inspector General, Florida Department of Law Enforcement, and the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation. It is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Kevin C. Frein. The asset forfeiture is being handled by Assistant United States Attorney Jennifer M. Harrington.

"Cuban National Pleads Guilty to Stealing More Than $800,000 From Elderly Victim’s Bank Account",https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/cuban-national-pleads-guilty-stealing-more-800000-elderly,"July 9, 2025",2025,"MIAMI – Michel Duarte Suarez, 50, a Cuban national, pleaded guilty for his role in a scheme he directed from his residence in Panama to obtain control over an elderly victim’s bank account, steal more than $800,000 from the victim’s account, and then launder the proceeds with the assistance of co-conspirators in South Florida.
Suarez was initially indicted in September 2023 but resided in Panama City, Panama at the time. In January 2025, Suarez was arrested in Panama and brought to South Florida to face the charges.
According to court documents, in March 2022 Suarez explained to a confidential informant that he had access to the bank of account of an elderly victim, who was 82 years old at the time.  To carry out the fraud conspiracy, Suarez created and mailed fraudulent checks from Panama to South Florida with directions to cash the checks and return 50% of the fraud proceeds to Suarez by wiring the money to Suarez’s Miami-based company, Online Electronics.  The fraudulent checks contained forged signatures designed to resemble that of the victim’s signature on his/her signature card for that same bank account.
In total, Suarez and his co-conspirators stole approximately $803,000 from the elderly victim’s bank account during a four-month period.
Sentencing is set for September 29, 2025, in Miami before United States District Court Judge Kathleen M. Williams.  Suarez pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud and mail fraud (Count 1) and one count of aggravated identity theft (Count 4). Suarez faces up to 30 years in prison on Count 1, and an additional mandatory two years in prison, to run consecutive to any term of imprisonment imposed on Count 1.

"Former HUD Employee, Who Moonlighted for Two Other Federal Agencies, Admits Making False Claims",https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/former-hud-employee-who-moonlighted-two-other-federal-agencies,"June 26, 2025",2025,"Defendant Caused an Estimated Loss to the U.S. Government of $225,866
WASHINGTON – Crissy Monique Baker, 45, a federal employee from Fairfax, Virginia, pleaded guilty today in U.S. District Court to making false, fictitious, or fraudulent claims in connection with claiming to work more hours for the government than she actually did.
The plea was announced by U.S. Attorney Jeanine Ferris Pirro, Acting Inspector General Stephen Ravas of AmeriCorps Office of Inspector General, FBI Assistant Director in Chief Steven J. Jensen of the Washington Field Office, and Acting Special Agent in Charge Michael Smith with the Department of U.S. Housing and Urban Development, Office of Inspector General.
Between October 2021 and May 2025, Baker worked as a management and program analyst for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. According to court documents, from October 2021 through July 2024, Baker held multiple full-time government contractor positions to perform human resources services for other federal agencies but did not seek approval from HUD to engage in this outside employment. Through this years-long scheme, Baker billed the government more than 24 hours in a single day between her employment with the federal government and contractors. The estimated loss to the government was $225,866.
Between September 2021 through April 2023, Contractor-A employed Baker to perform full-time work as a human resources assistant for AmeriCorps. From May 16, 2022, until Dec. 2, 2022, Contractor-B employed Baker to work full-time as a human resources specialist for the National Institutes of Health.
Because of her scheme, Baker willfully caused the contractors to submit false claims to the U.S. Government for hours that she did not actually work. In addition, Baker submitted timesheets to HUD certifying that she worked hours for the government agency that she never actually did. For example, in June 2022, Baker certified through timesheets to HUD, Contractor-A, and Contractor-B, that she worked 26 hours per day on 13 workdays out of a total of 21 workdays that month.
Since Baker teleworked in all three positions, she was able to conceal her employment with HUD and the two contractors from each other.
U.S. District Court Judge Sparkle L. Sooknanan scheduled sentencing for Sept. 30, 2025.
This case was investigated by the Offices of the Inspector General for the following agencies:  AmeriCorps; Housing and Urban Development; the Department of Energy; the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation; the Department of Homeland Security; the General Services Administration; the Department of Health and Human Services; and the Department of Treasury (Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration), the Department of Defense (Defense Criminal Investigate Service), and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, along with the FBI Washington Field Office.
The case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Will Hart and Kondi Kleinman.

Nicaraguan National Extradited from Spain for International Extortion and Wire Fraud Scheme,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/nicaraguan-national-extradited-spain-international-extortion-and,"June 17, 2025",2025,"MIAMI – Ernesto Ortega Padgett, a Nicaraguan national who was previously residing in Miami, FL and was deported from the United States in January 2020, made his initial appearance in a federal court in Miami on June 16. Ortega, a fugitive wanted in the United States, Spain, and Panama, was extradited from Madrid, Spain, to Miami to face federal charges related to an international wire fraud, extortion, and money laundering conspiracy that resulted in more than $29 million in losses to victims located across the United States.
Ortega, 41, is charged in a 27-count indictment returned by a federal grand jury on Feb. 2, 2023. The charges include:
Conspiracy to Commit Wire Fraud,
Wire Fraud,
Conspiracy to Commit Hobbs Act Extortion,
Conspiracy to Commit Money Laundering,
Making a Communication in Interstate Commerce Containing a Threat to Injure,
Engaging in Transactions Involving Criminally Derived Property, and
Conspiracy to Transport Stolen Property
According to the indictment, Ortega’s criminal scheme began in 2020 and targeted businesses across the United States. Ortega and his co-conspirators posed as bank representatives and used a combination of technology and social engineering to deceive victims into providing sensitive account information. Ortega and his co-conspirators then used that information to access victims’ bank accounts and initiate unauthorized wire transfers.
Ortega relied on an international network of money launderers to receive the stolen funds, withdraw them in cash, and forward the proceeds to accounts directly under Ortega’s control, often in the form of cryptocurrency. During commission of the scheme, Ortega and his co-conspirators used extortion, threatened force, and fear of injury to compel some money launderers to take part in the scheme.
Ortega conducted the scheme spanning multiple countries and continents, which resulted in losses exceeding $29 million.
Ortega had also been charged in Spain for related criminal conduct before fleeing that jurisdiction, as well as having pending charges in Panama. He remained a fugitive for nearly a year, with active warrants in all three countries. In December 2023, law enforcement received intelligence that Ortega would be traveling to Paris, France, for Christmas. Law enforcement subsequently intercepted Ortega, who was apprehended at the Charles de Gaulle International Airport in Paris. Ortega was then extradited back to Madrid pursuant to a European Union fugitive warrant, where he remained until extradited to the United States on June 13, pursuant to an indictment issued by the Southern District of Florida.
If convicted, Ortega faces up to 20 years in prison on the conspiracy to commit wire fraud charge, up to 20 years in prison on the wire fraud charge, up to 20 years in prison on the Hobbs Act charge, up to 20 years in prison on the conspiracy to commit money laundering charge, up to 20 years in prison on the making a communication in interstate commerce containing a threat to injure charge, up to 10 years in prison for the engaging in transactions involving criminally derived property charge, and up to five years in prison for the conspiracy to transport stolen property. Each count also carries the possibility of a fine and supervised release upon completion of any prison sentence. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.
U.S. Attorney Hayden P. O’Byrne for the Southern District of Florida; Special Agent in Charge Jason Scalzo of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC-OIG) Electronic Crimes Unit; and Special Agent in Charge Rafael Barros of the US Secret Service (USSS), Miami Field Office, made the announcement.
FDIC-OIG and the U.S. Secret Service are investigating the case. The Justice Department’s Office of International Affairs provided significant assistance in securing Ortega’s arrest and extradition.  The United States also thanks the Government of Spain, French authorities, the USSS Madrid Resident Office, and the USSS Paris Field Office for their valuable assistance.

Former Orange County Supervisor Sentenced to 5 Years in Prison for Bribery Scheme Involving More Than $10 Million in COVID Funds,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/former-orange-county-supervisor-sentenced-5-years-prison-bribery,"June 9, 2025",2025,"SANTA ANA, California – A former politician who served on the Orange County Board of Supervisors was sentenced today to 60 months in federal prison for accepting more than $550,000 in bribes for directing and voting in favor of more than $10 million in COVID-19 pandemic relief funds to a charity affiliated with one of his daughters.
Andrew Hoang Do, 62, of Santa Ana, was sentenced by United States District Judge James V. Selna, who scheduled a restitution hearing for August 11.
Do pleaded guilty in October 2024 to one count of conspiracy to commit bribery concerning programs receiving federal funds.
“Elected officials have a sworn duty to put their constituents’ interests ahead of their own,” said United States Attorney Bill Essayli. “Public money intended to assist aging and ailing pandemic victims instead filled the coffers of Do, his family, and insiders. I commend our prosecutors and law enforcement partners for their work on this important case and for helping to remove a corrupt politician from his seat of power.”
“As a county supervisor, Andrew Do transformed the County of Orange into an ATM available to his insiders, his loved ones, and himself, withdrawing millions of dollars to buy houses, lavish dinners, and expensive wine while the elderly, the sick, and the vulnerable who depended on Andrew Do were left to fend for themselves,” said Orange County District Attorney Todd Spitzer. “We, along with our federal partners, are continuing to peel back the layers of conspiracy to hold every thief accountable and return those stolen monies to the communities to which they belonged.”
“Mr. Do abused his powerful position as a county supervisor to profit personally at the expense of individuals in need, as well as the residents of Orange County, who deserve honest leadership,” said Akil Davis, the Assistant Director in Charge of the FBI's Los Angeles Field Office. “The FBI will continue to pursue corrupt public officials whose actions erode trust in government.”
From February 2015 until his resignation in October 2024, Do was one of five supervisors on the Orange County Board of Supervisors, which is responsible for the county’s $9 billion annual budget. As supervisor for the First District, Do represented the cities of Cypress, Fountain Valley, Garden Grove, Huntington Beach, La Palma, Los Alamitos, Midway City, Rossmoor, Seal Beach, and Westminster.
Beginning in 2020, in exchange for more than $550,000 in bribes, Do voted in favor of and directed millions of dollars in COVID-related funds to the Viet America Society (VAS), a charity affiliated with his daughter. Do directed and worked together with other county employees to approve contracts with – and payments to – VAS. Do further admitted he acted corruptly and abused his position of trust as a county supervisor.
Shortly after receiving the COVID-related public funds from the county government – funds that were intended to provide meals to the elderly and disabled – VAS from April 2021 to February 2024 paid a business identified in court documents as “Company #1” $100,000 or more per month, which totaled approximately $3,804,000. In September 2021, VAS increased its payments to Company #1 from $100,000 to $108,000 per month. Company #1 then began paying Rhiannon Do – Do’s daughter – $8,000 per month, totaling by February 2024 approximately $224,000.
In addition to the $8,000 monthly payments that Company #1 had made to Do’s daughter, in July 2023, Company #1 also transferred a total of $381,500 from the funds it had received from VAS to an escrow company. In July 2023, Do’s daughter used the escrow account funds to purchase a home, in her name, in Tustin for $1,035,000. As part of that transaction, a mortgage for more than $600,000 was obtained by a loan application that contained false information and with fabricated documents. Do’s daughter has admitted in court documents that her conduct was criminal and violated federal and state law.
The $381,500 from Company #1 that his daughter used to purchase the Tustin house in 2023 was a disguised bribe to Do. An additional $100,000 in payments sent to his other daughter, including three $25,000 checks from Company #2 – an air conditioning company that had been paid by VAS – also were bribes to Do.
Some of the bribe funds that had been funneled to his daughters were spent for his direct benefit. For example, during 2022, a total of $14,849 of funds that had been funneled to Do’s daughters was used to make property tax payments for properties in Orange County owned by Do and his wife. Approximately $15,000 was used to pay for one of Do’s credit card bills.
Do knew that VAS was not providing all the meals for which the county had paid VAS. Instead, much of the funds were used for the benefit of insiders, including to buy real estate in the name of both Do’s daughter and Company #1, bribe payments to both of Do’s daughters, payments to other conspirators, payments to other companies affiliated with VAS’s listed officers, and through hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash withdrawals.
Do forfeited assets connected to the bribery scheme, including the Tustin property his daughter purchased in 2023. As part of his daughter’s related diversion agreement, she forfeited the Tustin property. The plea agreement requires Do to pay full restitution, including the bribe money he and his daughters received. In August 2024, the government seized more than $2.4 million from VAS’s and Company #1’s bank accounts.
Do resigned from the Orange County Board of Supervisors as part of a related agreement with the Orange County District Attorney’s Office (OCDA). He also agreed to forfeit any pension credit for the time where he participated in the bribery conspiracy.
The FBI; the Orange County District Attorney’s Office Bureau of Investigation; the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Office of the Inspector General; IRS Criminal Investigation; and the United States Department of Education Office of the Inspector General investigated this matter.
This matter is being jointly prosecuted by the United States Attorney’s Office and OCDA. The prosecution is being led by Assistant United States Attorneys Nandor F.R. Kiss, Rosalind Wang, and Tara Vavere of the United States Attorney’s Office and Senior Deputy District Attorney Avery T. Harrison and Deputy District Attorney Anthony J. Schlehner of the OCDA.

Founder of O.C.-Based Non-Profit Charged in 15-Count Indictment Alleging He Bribed County Supervisor in $12 Million Scheme,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/founder-oc-based-non-profit-charged-15-count-indictment-alleging,"June 6, 2025",2025,"SANTA ANA, California – The founder of a now-shuttered non-profit organization has been indicted on federal charges alleging he bribed then-Orange County Supervisor Andrew Hoang Do to obtain approximately $12 million in COVID-19 pandemic-related funds, pocketed the bulk of that money, then laundered it to avoid detection by law enforcement, the Justice Department announced today.
Peter Anh Pham, 65, of Garden Grove, is charged with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, one count of conspiracy to commit honest services wire fraud, six counts of wire fraud, six counts of concealment money laundering, and one count of bribery.
Also charged in the indictment is Thanh Huong Nguyen, 61, of Santa Ana, who is charged with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, one count of wire fraud, and one count of concealment money laundering.
Pham is considered to be a fugitive from justice. Nguyen’s initial appearance and arraignment are expected to occur on Monday in U.S. District Court in Santa Ana.
“These two defendants are charged with conspiring with a corrupt politician to pad their pockets while the nation suffered under the weight of COVID-19,” said United States Attorney Bill Essayli. “My office and our law enforcement partners will continue our efforts to prosecute individuals who cashed in on government aid intended to help those impacted by the largest public health emergency in a century.”
“This conspiracy was a house of cards built on lies, betrayal, and insatiable greed,” said Orange County District Attorney Todd Spitzer. “Today’s indictments are another critical step in ensuring accountability – and consequences – for those who conspired to use the County of Orange’s COVID-19 funds as their personal ATMs – and to return those stolen funds to their rightful owners – the community for which these funds were originally intended.”
According to the indictment that was returned on Wednesday and unsealed today, Pham was a friend and associate of Do, 62, of Santa Ana, who served on the Orange County Board of Supervisors from 2015 until his resignation in October 2024. In that role, Do was one of five supervisors on the Board, which is responsible for the county’s $9 billion annual budget.
Do pleaded guilty in October 2024 to one count of conspiracy to commit bribery concerning programs receiving federal funds and is scheduled to be sentenced on June 9, when he will face a sentence of up to five years in federal prison.
From June 2020 to October 2024, Do used his official position as a county supervisor to vote for millions of dollars in county funds to be allocated in his district, subject to disbursement at his sole discretion. Do then steered county contracts and grants to Pham and Nguyen, the indictment alleges.
For example, in June 2020, Do voted to approve an agenda item that, in part, allocated $5 million in federal COVID-19 pandemic-relief funding to a county nutrition program. As part of this agenda item, Do authorized himself a budget of $1 million to develop that nutrition program in his district, which he could distribute without further approval from the rest of the Board. Eight days after Do voted to approve the agenda item, Pham founded the Huntington Beach-based non-profit organization Viet America Society (VAS).
Pham, through VAS, and Nguyen, through a Garden Grove-based group called Hand-to-Hand Relief Organization Inc. (H2H), entered into contracts and beneficiary agreements with the county. In many of these contracts, VAS and H2H falsely represented that they would reimburse the county for any funds not spent for the contract’s intended purpose. In each of the beneficiary agreements, VAS and H2H falsely certified that all funds would be used solely for the grant’s intended purpose.
In exchange for Pham’s bribes in the form of payments to his two daughters, Do used his official position as a county supervisor to advocate for VAS and H2H so county employees would approve contracts and beneficiary agreements between the county and these organizations. Do and his staff – including his chief of staff – edited the terms of those contracts and agreements to make them more favorable to Pham and Nguyen. Through the influence of Do and his staff, the county wired funds to Pham and Nguyen.
After receiving county funds, Pham and Nguyen transferred most of the money to other entities they controlled. They then spent large portions of the funds to pay personal expenses such as rent and bills, to pay off debts owed by their other businesses, and to make personal investments such as purchasing commercial and residential real estate. Pham and Nguyen also used county funds to bribe Do through payments to his daughters.
Pham also used county money to pay the eventual wife of Do’s chief of staff, under the guise that she was providing consulting services to VAS. Do’s chief of staff then used his position in Orange County’s government to help VAS and H2H obtain county contracts, edited the contracts’ terms to make them more favorable to VAS and H2H, and helped those organizations fulfill reporting requirements and get paid.
When required to submit invoices to the county to account for how the money was being spent, Pham and Nguyen submitted false documents, claiming to have used all the funds – all solely for legitimate purposes and according to the contracts’ terms.
To disguise the funds’ source, Pham and an associate caused checks from county funds to be written to a Westminster-based company called D Air Conditioning Co. LLC. This company then issued checks from its corporate bank account to Pham, Pham’s associate, and one of Do’s daughters.
In total, Pham and Nguyen unlawfully acquired approximately $12 million in county funds through this conspiracy.
An indictment contains allegations that a defendant has committed a crime.  Every defendant is presumed innocent until and unless proved guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
If convicted of the charges, Pham and Nguyen would face a statutory maximum sentence of 20 years in federal prison for the conspiracy count, each wire fraud count, and each money laundering count. Pham also would face up to 10 years in federal prison for the bribery count.

Par Funding Principal and Former CFO Sentenced to 66 Months in Prison for Racketeering Conspiracy,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/par-funding-principal-and-former-cfo-sentenced-66-months-prison,"June 2, 2025",2025,"PHILADELPHIA – United States Attorney David Metcalf announced that Joseph Cole Barleta, 41, of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, was sentenced today by United States District Court Judge Mark A. Kearney to 66 months’ imprisonment, three years’ supervised release, $302,700,484.60 in restitution, and forfeiture of $8,063,303.83, for racketeering conspiracy (RICO), in connection with his role in the operation of a fraudulent investment vehicle known as Complete Business Solutions Group Inc. d/b/a Par Funding (“Par Funding”).
Barleta was charged by second superseding indictment in February of 2024 and pleaded guilty to the RICO charge in October.
As detailed in court filings and admitted to by the defendant, Barleta and co-defendants Joseph LaForte, James LaForte, and others, were part of an association-in-fact RICO enterprise that conspired to commit a number of predicate crimes, including crimes related to the fleecing of Par Funding’s many investors.
Barleta’s role in the conspiracy related to helping financially engineer the securities and wire fraud components of the enterprise at the direction of Joseph LaForte. In particular, Barleta manipulated financial statements, fudged numbers, and cooked the internal books of Par Funding in order to deceive investors into thinking that Par Funding was profitable and successful, when the business was actually losing significant amounts year after year.
In January 2025, the Court found the Par Funding fraud scheme caused an actual fraud loss of approximately $404,000,000, which it reduced to $288,395,088 after factoring in credit for collateral that federal authorities seized from Par Funding when the investigation became public in July 2020, upon the SEC placing Par Funding in receivership.
Joe LaForte and James LaForte pleaded guilty last year to racketeering conspiracy, securities fraud, and related crimes. In March, Joe LaForte was sentenced to 15½ years in prison and James LaForte to 11½ years in prison.
“Barleta played a key role in the massive fraud scheme that was Par Funding,” said U.S. Attorney Metcalf. “He participated in an extensive and destructive conspiracy that inflicted substantial harm on the community. My office will continue to prosecute perpetrators of these complex financial crimes and vindicate the victims who lose their hard-earned money to them.”
“This sentencing holds Joseph Barleta accountable for his criminal actions, including securities and wire fraud,” said Wayne A. Jacobs, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI’s Philadelphia Division. “The FBI, together with our partners, remains unwavering in our commitment to identify, investigate, and disrupt complex financial crimes, ensuring that those who perpetrate them are brought to justice.”
“Mr. Barleta was brought to justice today for his role in the operation of a fraudulent investment vehicle that deceived Par Funding’s numerous investors and caused them significant financial losses,” said Patricia Tarasca, Special Agent in Charge of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC OIG), New York Region. “The FDIC OIG will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to investigate and hold accountable those who participate in fraudulent schemes such as these, that harm investors and threaten the safety and soundness of our Nation’s financial system.”
This case was investigated by the FBI, FDIC OIG, IRS Criminal Investigation, and the Pennsylvania State Police and is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys Matthew Newcomer, Samuel Dalke, and Eric Gill. The SEC in Florida investigated and litigated the civil securities fraud charges, which formed the basis of a portion of the criminal prosecution.

According to the information, between April 30, 2020, and February 25, 2022, Trenkle applied for and received $1,850,000 in COVID-19 Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL) from the Small Business Administration (SBA) and $2,999,995 in Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) funds from an SBA-approved lender.  The information alleges that after first obtaining an EIDL loan in March 2020, Trenkle made two requests to increase the amount of his EIDL and made false representations as part of each of request.  The information further alleges that Trenkle submitted two fraudulent PPP loan applications, and also submitted fraudulent applications for PPP loan forgiveness for each PPP loan.
The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act was enacted in March 2020 and was designed to provide emergency financial assistance to Americans dealing with the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.  The CARES Act created the PPP, a program administered by the SBA that provided loans to small businesses to retain workers, maintain payroll, and certain other expenses consistent with PPP rules.  Additionally, the CARES Act authorized the SBA to provide EIDLs to eligible small businesses experiencing substantial financial disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The defendant made his initial appearance on May 22, 2025, in Denver in front of Magistrate Judge Cyrus Y. Chung.
The charges contained in the information are allegations and the defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.

Former Exec at O.C. Company and Illegal Alien Arrested on Federal Complaint Alleging He Embezzled $7 Million from His Employer,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/former-exec-oc-company-and-illegal-alien-arrested-federal,"May 22, 2025",2025,"SANTA ANA, California – A former executive at a Newport Beach company that specializes in the purchase of classic cars – who also happens to be an illegal alien from Mexico – was arrested today on a federal complaint alleging he embezzled approximately $7 million from his employer.
Alexander G. Ramos, 62, of Newport Beach, is charged with wire fraud, a felony that carries a statutory maximum sentence of 20 years in federal prison.
A federal magistrate judge ordered Ramos jailed without bond and scheduled an arraignment for June 30.
According to an affidavit filed with the complaint, Ramos was employed at the victim company since 2017 until his termination in September 2024 in the company’s Risk Management Department. Through his positions, he knew his employer’s loans and held relationships with title agents or other partners nationwide. He also oversaw requests by the company’s Title and Risk Department to its Accounting Department for payment to title agents, sometimes submitting the requests himself.
Ramos allegedly caused checks to be issued from the victim company to certain parties, including a Las Vegas DMV services business. The checks were supposed to cover expenses for tax, titling, and licensing associated with car purchases.
However, Ramos purposely caused his employer to send too much money to the outside entities. He then directed those entities on how to dispose of the extra money, including by sending the funds to bank accounts that he controlled.
A law enforcement review of financial records revealed that approximately $7 million in checks and wires were deposited into Ramos-controlled bank accounts from the outside entities in the car industry. The origin of some of the funds deposited into Ramos’s bank accounts showed the checks and wires were made out to the victim company and were intended as refunds to that company’s clients who had overpaid for vehicle registration fees.
Instead of being returned directly to the Ramos’s employer, Ramos allegedly moved the funds to other accounts he controlled for his personal use, including buying a home in Irvine. The illegal transfers date back to at least January 2020, according to the complaint.
Ramos is an illegal alien from Mexico who was removed from the United States in 2017 but later returned.
A complaint contains allegations that a defendant has committed a crime. Every defendant is presumed to be innocent until and unless proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in court.

Former Bank of O’Fallon executive pleads guilty to swindling $2 million in check kiting fraud scheme,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/former-bank-ofallon-executive-pleads-guilty-swindling-2-million,"May 20, 2025",2025,"EAST ST. LOUIS, Ill. – The former second-in-command of the Bank of O’Fallon appeared in federal court Monday to admit to charges for engaging in a fraud scheme to obtain more than $2 million.
Andrew P. Blassie, 69, of St. Louis, pleaded guilty to one count of bank fraud and one count of interstate transportation of security or funds obtained by fraud.
“This conviction, secured shortly after Blassie’s April 8 indictment, reflects the investigators’ outstanding work and the Bank of O’Fallon’s vital cooperation to dismantle the scheme. This result delivers swift justice for O’Fallon’s residents and protects the integrity of our financial system,” said U.S. Attorney Steven D. Weinhoeft. “He must face a serious consequence for betraying his clients, employer, family, and community.”
According to the indictment, Blassie served as the Executive Vice President for the Bank of O’Fallon and defrauded the bank out of $1,972,887.67 in a check kite scheme from September 2023 through September 2024 during his employment.
Blassie admitted to falsely inflating the balance of his personal checking account at the Bank of O’Fallon by depositing checks he knew to be backed by non-sufficient funds. He deposited checks with non-sufficient funds from four personal accounts at three other banks and one credit union into the Bank of O’Fallon account.
“The level of corruption the defendant in this case achieved was beyond shameful. Rather than serve the Bank of O’Fallon and its customers, the defendant chose to serve himself – to more than $2 million. His guilty plea today should send a message to others who would seek to rip off their unsuspecting customers that they will be caught, and they will be held accountable,” Resident Agent in Charge Michael Kurzeja, of the U.S. Secret Service Springfield Office said. “I thank all of our Federal, state and local partners who helped in the successful prosecution of this former bank executive.”
Blassie paid nearly $2.7 million for personal expenses from the falsely inflated account thus using funds belonging to the Bank of O’Fallon. As the former Executive Vice President, Blassie used his position to conceal his fraud from the Bank of O’Fallon by scrubbing his name and account number from the suspected kiting reports.
“This former bank executive abused his position of trust and the trust of the community for personal enrichment,” said Special Agent in Charge Vincent R. Zehme, of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC OIG), Chicago Region. “The FDIC OIG is pleased to join our law enforcement partners in announcing today’s guilty plea, and we remain committed to investigating and holding bank insiders who commit fraud accountable, as we seek to preserve the integrity of our Nation’s banking system and to protect depositors and financial consumers.”
From August 2022 through September 2024, Blassie also persuaded a couple from Lebanon, Illinois, to give him $489,000 of their retirement savings. In return for this investment, Blassie gave the couple two promissory notes. He agreed to pay the couple interest on the notes and used money he obtained through his check kite scheme to pay some of that interest.
As security for his promissory notes, Blassie pledged 128 of his and his wife’s shares of the holding company which owns the Bank of O’Fallon.
“Andrew Blassie abused his position of trust as a bank executive by committing fraud for his own personal gain and has now been brought to justice for his actions,” said Jon Ellwanger, Special Agent in Charge, Western Region, Office of Inspector General for the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. “We are proud to have worked with our law enforcement partners to achieve this plea agreement.”
According to the indictment, Blassie later sold most of these shares and did not use those funds to repay the Lebanon couple. This left the couple with no means of recourse when Blassie later defaulted on the promissory notes.
“The Federal Housing Finance Agency, Office of Inspector General (FHFA-OIG) is committed to investigating allegations of fraud involving bank officials who abuse their position of public trust and financial institutions, particularly the Federal Home Loan Banks,” said Korey Brinkman, Special Agent in Charge of the FHFA-OIG’s Central Region. “We are proud to have partnered with the U.S. Secret Service, FDIC OIG, FRB OIG, and the O’Fallon (IL) Police Department on this case.”
Officials with the Bank of O’Fallon have fully cooperated with law enforcement during the investigation. Blassie’s sentencing is scheduled for 10:30 a.m. on Sept. 18 at the federal courthouse in East St. Louis.
The O’Fallon Police Department, U.S. Secret Service, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General, the Office of Inspector General for the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and the Federal Housing Finance Agency, Office of Inspector General made contributions to the investigation.

Santa Barbara County Investment Advisor Sentenced to Over 10 Years in Prison for Stealing Nearly $2.3 Million From Elderly Clients,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/santa-barbara-county-investment-advisor-sentenced-over-10-years,"May 19, 2025",2025,"LOS ANGELES – A Santa Barbara County investment advisor was sentenced today to 121 months in federal prison for stealing approximately $2.25 million from elderly clients of her investment advisory business, including clients that were receiving end-of-life care.
Julie Anne Darrah, 52, of Santa Maria, was sentenced by United States District Judge Otis D. Wright II, who will schedule a restitution hearing at a later date.
Darrah pleaded guilty on March 4 to one count of wire fraud.
During the scheme, Darrah stole approximately $2.25 million from her firm’s clients. She did so by obtaining control of her victims’ assets, and then – without the victims’ knowledge or consent – she liquidated their security holdings and transferred the proceeds to accounts she controlled. As part of this, she convinced victims to sign documents making her the trustee of their trusts or a signatory on their bank accounts or giving her power of attorney over their brokerage accounts and allowing her – as their investment advisor – to transfer funds from their accounts to other bank accounts, including to her own accounts.
Darrah took advantage of trust victims placed in her – often convincing them she would take care of them in their older years like a daughter, and she used this trust to convince them to sign the documents that she then used to steal money from them. In this way, Darrah stole money from victims from approximately November 2016 to July 2023. She used stolen funds to buy properties for herself, pay other personal expenses, buy luxury vehicles, and operate other business ventures. Some victims were left in desperate circumstances, without the money to pay for end-of-life care, when the fraud was discovered.
Darrah also convinced a company identified in the plea agreement as “Business Victim 1,” a Minnesota-based investment advisor firm, to acquire VFM based on false and misleading statements and the concealment of material facts, including not telling that firm about her theft of individual client funds. After the fraud was discovered, Business Victim 1 incurred approximately $5.4 million in losses.
In October 2023, the SEC filed a civil complaint against Darrah in connection with this scheme. In December 2024, United States District Judge Dale S. Fischer found Darrah liable to pay $2,416,511, including interest.
The FBI and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General investigated this matter.

Jonathan Travis Mackey, 46, of Loveland, allegedly exploited child victims both online and in person while employed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).
Mackey was indicted by a federal grand jury on April 30 and charged with sexually exploiting a child and receiving child pornography.
According to his court documents, Mackey chatted online with whom he believed to be an approximately 13-year-old girl and enticed her to send him sexually explicit photos. Mackey sent messages on Discord that were sexual in nature and allegedly planned to meet in person at a hotel near her home. Mackey’s Discord activity also allegedly included messages with an adult woman in which Mackey and the woman discuss their desires to sexually abuse minors.
It is also alleged that Mackey exploited a second victim through hands-on sexual abuse.
If convicted as charged, Mackey could face up to 50 years in prison.
Kyle Rist, 38, of Cincinnati, was also indicted by a federal grand jury on April 30. He is charged with coercion and enticement, 16 counts of sexually exploiting minors, receiving child pornography and possessing child pornography.
According to his charging documents, in September 2023, the grandparents of a teenaged victim alerted law enforcement in Oregon that their granddaughter had been sending and receiving sexually explicit videos of herself and of Rist, who is also known as Jeremy Hadley, through Facebook.
A publicly-filed affidavit details that Rist referred to himself as daddy to the victim and also told the victim they were in a relationship. It is alleged that Rist – pretending to be another man by the name of Jeremy Hadley – had ongoing online discussions with the same teenage victim.
It is alleged that between August and November 2024, Rist sexually exploited a second 7-year-old child in person by producing visual depictions of the victim engaging in and assisting another person in sexually explicit conduct.
If convicted as charged, Rist could face up to life in prison.

New York tax preparer sentenced to two years in prison for submitting fraudulent pandemic relief applications,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/new-york-tax-preparer-sentenced-two-years-prison-submitting,"May 9, 2025",2025,"RICHMOND, Va. – A New York man was sentenced today to two years in prison for making false statements on loan applications he submitted on behalf of his clients through a pandemic relief program.
According to court documents, Baltej Singh Brar, 42, of South Richmond Hill, New York, owned and operated Aspire Tax & Accounting Services Inc., a tax preparation, accounting, and consulting firm where Brar was an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) registered tax preparer. In 2021, Brar began filing loan applications on behalf of other individuals through the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), a COVID-19 relief program intended to provide loans backed by the Small Business Administration (SBA) to certain businesses, nonprofit organizations, and others to help them remain afloat during the pandemic.
Brar advertised, including on TikTok, that he would file PPP loan applications on behalf of clients in exchange for a flat up-front fee paired with 10% of the loan value after the loan was approved. Brar instructed prospective PPP applicants to provide him with their Social Security number, a copy of their driver’s license, email address, prior bank statements, 2019 tax return, and a void check to be used as supporting documentation on applications.
Most of Brar’s clients were sole proprietors, including taxi drivers, truck drivers, and construction workers. Where clients’ prior year incomes fell below the threshold to receive the maximum PPP loan amount of $20,833, Brar falsely inflated the income amounts in the PPP applications to trigger the maximum loan amount. Brar generated and submitted false and fabricated IRS forms as supporting documentation. Brar certified on each application that the information provided in the applications and supporting documents and forms was “true and accurate in all material respects.”
Many of Brar’s clients were eligible to receive PPP loans, though not in the inflated amounts of the PPP loan applications that Brar prepared. Others were not entitled to receive PPP loans at all. Across the hundreds of PPP loan applications that Brar falsified, Brar caused the SBA at least $550,000 in actual losses.

Former Algona Meatpacking Plant Worker Convicted in Pandemic Benefits Fraud Conspiracy,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/former-algona-meatpacking-plant-worker-convicted-pandemic,"May 9, 2025",2025,"Co-Schemers Stole Over $2.4 Million
A former Algona, Iowa, meatpacking plant worker who obtained fraudulent Paycheck Protection Program loans and recruited others into the scheme was convicted by a jury on May 8, 2025, after a four-day trial in federal court in Sioux City.
Yovany Ciero, age 48, from Mason City, Iowa, formerly of Cuba, Colombia, and Venezuela, was convicted of three counts of wire fraud, 23 counts of money laundering, one count of engaging in a monetary transaction in property derived from a specified unlawful activity, and one count of money laundering conspiracy.  The verdict was returned following about three and a half hours of jury deliberations.
The evidence at trial showed that Ciero is a former Sergeant in the Cuban military who crossed the Mexican border nearly twenty years ago after his request for a visa to enter the United States was denied.  In 2020, Ciero was working at an Algona meatpacking plant when the COVID-19 pandemic began.  Beginning in July 2020, Ciero, and over one hundred other immigrants from Cuba, obtained fraudulent Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans on the false and fraudulent pretenses that they were self-employed businesspeople who earned approximately $100,000 in gross income in 2019 when they actually worked at the meatpacking plant or elsewhere in 2019.
Ciero was one of six “bundlers” in the fraudulent PPP loan scheme.  Ciero’s role was to recruit individuals into the scheme, obtain their personal identifying information for the fraudulent loan applications, and then pass that information to others who submitted the fraudulent loan applications to lenders who were participating in the PPP.  The evidence established that over $4 million in fraudulent loan PPP applications were submitted, and the government lost over $2.4 million as a result.
Once the individuals received their fraudulent PPP loan funds, typically $20,000 each, Ciero served as a “funnel” in a money laundering conspiracy.  Ciero collected fees that the organizers of the scheme charged the applicants, typically $3,000 per $20,000 fraudulent loan.
Ciero also obtained two fraudulent PPP loans for himself and his paramour.  Ciero used most of this PPP loan money to purchase a semi-truck.  Ciero is the sixth former Iowa meatpacking plant worker convicted in the PPP scheme.
Sentencing before United States District Court Judge Leonard T. Strand will be set after a presentence report is prepared.  Ciero remains free on bond pending sentencing.  Ciero faces a possible maximum sentence of life imprisonment, over $10,000,000 in fines, and three years of supervised release following any imprisonment.
The case is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys Timothy L. Vavricek and Daniel A. Chatham and was investigated by the Small Business Administration - Office of Inspector General, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation - Office of Inspector General, Homeland Security Investigations, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Storm Lake Police Department.

Real Estate Developer Sentenced to More Than Six Years in Prison for Embezzling Millions From the Failed Washington Federal Bank in Chicago,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/real-estate-developer-sentenced-more-six-years-prison-embezzling,"April 30, 2025",2025,"CHICAGO — A federal judge in Chicago has sentenced a real estate developer to more than six years in prison for participating in a conspiracy that embezzled millions of dollars from the failed Washington Federal Bank for Savings in Chicago.
Washington Federal, which was based in Chicago’s Bridgeport neighborhood, was shut down in 2017 after the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency determined that the bank was insolvent and had at least $66 million in nonperforming loans. For more than a decade, developer MIROSLAW KREJZA was part of a conspiracy that embezzled millions of dollars in bank funds.  The embezzled funds were disguised as purported real estate development loan disbursements to Krejza and others.  The conspirators were not required to repay these purported loans, and they never did.
A federal jury in 2023 convicted Krejza, 67, of Chicago, of conspiring to commit embezzlement and falsify bank records, and aiding and abetting embezzlement by bank employees.  On Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Virginia M. Kendall sentenced Krejza to six years and eight months in prison and ordered him to pay more than $2 million in restitution.
The sentence was announced by Andrew S. Boutros, United States Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois; Vincent R. Zehme, Special Agent-in-Charge of the Chicago Region of the FDIC’s Office of Inspector General; Douglas S. DePodesta, Special Agent-in-Charge of the Chicago Field Office of the FBI; Machelle L. Jindra, Special Agent-in-Charge of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's Office of Inspector General in Chicago; Ramsey E. Covington, Acting Special Agent-in-Charge of IRS Criminal Investigation in Chicago; Korey Brinkman, Special Agent-in-Charge of the Central Region of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, Office of Inspector General; Andrea Peacock, Special Agent-in-Charge of the Department of the Treasury, Office of Inspector General; Deborah Witzburg, City of Chicago Inspector General; and Kathryn B. Richards, Chicago Housing Authority Inspector General.  Valuable assistance was provided by the U.S. Trustee Program.  The government was represented by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Michelle Petersen, Kristin Pinkston, and Jeffrey Snell, and Special Assistant U.S. Attorney Brian Netols.
The federal investigation into the collapse of Washington Federal led to criminal charges against 16 defendants, including the bank’s Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer, and other high-ranking employees, for conspiring to embezzle at least $31 million in bank funds.   Krejza and three others were convicted after jury trials, while ten defendants pleaded guilty and two entered into deferred prosecution agreements.
Much of the embezzled money was transferred to Chicago attorney ROBERT M. KOWALSKI, real estate developer MAREK MATCZUK, and other individuals outside the bank without all of the required documentation and often without any documentation whatsoever.  A jury convicted Robert Kowalski on bankruptcy fraud, bank embezzlement, and tax charges, while Matczuk was convicted of conspiring to commit embezzlement and falsify bank records, as well as aiding and abetting embezzlement by bank employees.  Judge Kendall last year sentenced Robert Kowalski to 25 years in federal prison and Matczuk to nearly 13 years .

Former Monmouth County Resident Sentenced to 16 Years in Prison for Role in Fraudulently Obtaining Over $3.7 Million in Cares Act Loans,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/former-monmouth-county-resident-sentenced-16-years-prison-role,"April 29, 2025",2025,"NEWARK, N.J. – A former resident of Monmouth County was sentenced to prison for his role in a scheme to fraudulently obtain Payroll Protection Program (PPP) and Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) funds, U.S. Attorney Alina Habba announced.
Kevin Aguilar, age 54, previously of Farmingdale, New Jersey, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Michael A. Shipp in Trenton federal court following Aguilar’s guilty plea to one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud; seven counts of bank fraud; one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud; three counts of wire fraud; one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering; one count of money laundering; and one count of aggravated identity theft. Aguilar was sentenced to 192 months in prison.
According to documents filed in this case and statements made in court:
From April 2020 to April 2021, Aguilar conspired with others to submit seven fraudulent PPP loan applications and three fraudulent EIDL applications on behalf of four businesses. Based on the fraudulent applications, Aguilar received a total of approximately $3.3 million in PPP loan funds and approximately $450,000 in EIDL funds. After receiving the PPP and EIDL funds, Aguilar caused those funds to be transferred to other businesses that he created to give the false appearance that the PPP and EIDL funds were being used for legitimate purposes. Aguilar then used the PPP and EIDL funds to purchase residential properties in Sherman, Texas, a new truck for approximately $100,000, and to pay for other personal expenses.
In addition to the 192-month prison term, Judge Shipp sentenced Aguilar to 5 years of supervised release and ordered him to pay $3,772,567 in restitution, as well as a forfeiture money judgment of $3,772,567.  Judge Shipp also ordered the forfeiture of approximately $1,511,221.62 that law enforcement seized from twelve bank accounts, as well as the three real properties in Sherman, Texas.
U.S. Attorney Habba credited special agents of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation – Office of Inspector General, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Patricia Tarasca in New York; IRS – Criminal Investigation, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Jenifer Piovesan; special agents of the Social Security Administration, Office of the Inspector General, under the direction of Acting Special Agent in Charge Amy Connelly; postal inspectors of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, under the direction of Inspector in Charge Christopher A.

PHILADELPHIA – United States Attorney David Metcalf announced that Rodney Ermel, 71, of Colorado entered a plea of guilty today before United States District Court Judge Mark Kearney on charges of tax evasion and conspiracy to defraud the United States.
According to court documents and statements made in court, Ermel owned and managed a Colorado-based accounting firm. Along with co-defendant Kenneth Bacon, Ermel provided accounting and tax preparation services for co-defendant Joseph LaForte, LaForte’s wife and co-defendant Lisa McElhone, and their business entities. Ermel conspired with LaForte, Bacon, and others to hide approximately $20 million in income.
He did this through various fraudulent accounting practices, such as fabricating shareholder loans and “bad debt” deductions. Ermel also filed tax returns which he knew underreported taxable income by over $20 million between 2016 and 2018. Ermel’s fraud caused a loss to the United States of over $8 million.
Ermel is the fourth defendant to plead guilty to criminal conduct related to this tax scheme. Sentencing is scheduled for September 3.

Maryland Settlement Processor Pleads Guilty to Submitting False Settlement Statements to Financial Institutions,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/maryland-settlement-processor-pleads-guilty-submitting-false,"April 14, 2025",2025,"Baltimore, Maryland – Rebecca Marie Cohn, aka Rebecca Marie Stanton, 38, of Fallston, Maryland, pled guilty in federal court to knowingly and willfully making false statements to financial institutions in connection with real-estate settlements.
Kelly O. Hayes, U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland, announced the guilty plea with Special Agent in Charge Robert Manchak, Federal Housing Finance Agency Office of Inspector General (FHFA-OIG), and Special Agent in Charge Jeffrey D. Pittano, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC-OIG), Mid-Atlantic Region.
From 2013 through 2019, Cohn worked as a settlement and title processor for Residential Title & Escrow Company, a real estate title company located in Owings Mills, Maryland.  As part of her job handling real estate property settlements, Cohn created, reviewed, and submitted HUD-1 Settlement Statements to financial institutions.  Cohn was also responsible for documenting incoming funds and disbursements in connection with real-estate closings, along with providing financial institutions with documentation of equity injections utilized in real-estate transactions.
At Residential, Cohn engaged in settlement work in connection with co-defendants Mehul Ramesh Khatiwala, aka “Mike Khatiwala,” 43, of Voorhees, New Jersey, Rajendra G. Parikh, 64, of Monroe, New Jersey, Jennifer H. Watkins, 48, of Marlton, New Jersey, and entities associated with them.  Khatiwala, Parikh, and Watkins recently pled guilty to a conspiracy to obtain loan proceeds to buy and sell hotels in connection with a hotel-flipping scheme.
“Flipping” is a real-estate investment strategy that involves purchasing property to hold for a short period before selling it to make a quick profit.  Khatiwala, Parikh, and Watkins created limited liability companies with no significant business activity (“shell entities” or “selling entities”) to purchase hotel properties.  They then created a second company to purchase the hotels from the shell companies at substantially higher prices.  Cohn performed settlement work for the second part of the flip transaction.
Khatiwala, Parikh, and Watkins sought loans for those transactions through the SBA’s Section 7(a) Program, which guaranteed and insured approximately 75-85 percent of these loans, and required that the small business owner/borrower invest a certain amount of their own money into the business to qualify for the loan.
From June 2019 until August 2019, Cohn worked with Khatiwala, Watkins, and Parikh, handling settlement transactions that she knew the information represented on the HUD-1 Settlement Statements was materially false. Cohn also made false statements to financial institutions by sending them information about buyers’ equity injections in the form of checks, bank records, and other documents.
Through these false statements Cohn claimed to show that various equity injections occurred, knowing that those funds had already been represented as used for a previous real-estate hotel settlement.  Cohn knew that the financial institutions relied on the false statements to decide to extend the loans to the borrowing entities.
On July 23, 2019, Cohn knowingly submitted a materially false HUD-1 Settlement Statement in connection with an SBA guaranteed loan to North State Bank. The statement substantially overrepresented the deposit or earnest money that the borrowing entity actually utilized in the transaction.
Additionally, in the statement she provided for the loan settlement, she falsely claimed that the settlement took place on July 23, 2019. But the settlement could not have taken place on that date because the selling entity did not own the hotel until July 24, 2019.  Cohn knew that the selling entity did not own the hotel on July 23, 2019, as she used the loan proceeds provided by North State Bank to help the selling entity purchase the hotel.
Cohn is facing a maximum sentence of 30 years in federal prison for making false statements to a financial institution.  Actual sentences for federal crimes are typically less than the maximum penalties.  A federal district court judge determines sentencing after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.
U.S. Attorney Hayes commended the FHFA-OIG and FDIC-OIG for their work in the investigation.  Ms. Hayes also thanked Assistant U.S. Attorneys Harry M. Gruber, Evelyn L. Cusson, and Ari D. Evans, who are prosecuting the federal case, and recognized Paralegal Specialists Joanna B.N. Huber and Zharde Todman.

Former Bank of O’Fallon executive indicted for $2 million fraud scheme,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/former-bank-ofallon-executive-indicted-2-million-fraud-scheme,"April 9, 2025",2025,"EAST ST. LOUIS, Ill. – A federal grand jury in southern Illinois charged the former second-in-command of the Bank of O’Fallon for engaging in a fraud scheme to obtain more than $2 million.
Andrew P. Blassie, 69, of St. Louis, is facing one count of bank fraud and one count of interstate transportation of security or funds obtained by fraud.
“Senior bank officials must act as fiduciaries, not felons—they must serve the bank, not swindle it,” said U.S. Attorney Steven D. Weinhoeft. “The federal justice system leads the fight against corruption in all its forms, and the allegations in this case—a $2 million check kiting scheme and a $500,000 investor rip-off—are glaring examples of the type of financial betrayal that will not be tolerated. We commend the Bank of O’Fallon for their cooperation with the investigation, which has been vital to ensuring both that justice is served, and that the integrity of the financial system is preserved.”
According to the indictment, Blassie served as the Executive Vice President for the Bank of O’Fallon and is charged with defrauding the bank out of $1,972,887.67 in a check kite scheme from September 2023 through September 2024 during his employment.
Blassie is accused of falsely inflating the balance of his personal checking account at the Bank of O’Fallon by depositing checks he knew to be backed by non-sufficient funds. He allegedly deposited checks with non-sufficient funds from four personal accounts at three other banks and one credit union into the Bank of O’Fallon account.
“Bank fraud is a serious crime that has real victims. It’s worsened when someone in a position of trust violates that authority, as the defendant is alleged to have done in this case to a staggering degree,” Resident Agent in Charge Michael Kurzeja, of the U.S. Secret Service Springfield Resident Office said. “The U.S. Secret Service takes very seriously its duty to protect the nation’s financial infrastructure. I’m proud of our agents’ work to dismantle the scheme in this case. I am thankful for the work of our Federal, state, and local partners who helped in this case.”
The indictment alleges Blassie paid nearly $2.7 million for personal expenses from the falsely inflated account thus using funds belonging to the Bank of O’Fallon. As the former Executive Vice President, Blassie is accused of using his position to conceal his fraud from the Bank of O’Fallon by scrubbing his name and account number from the suspected kiting reports.
“This indictment charges a former bank executive for allegedly engaging in a check kiting scheme that fraudulently obtained funds from the Bank of O’Fallon,” said Special Agent in Charge Vincent R. Zehme, of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC OIG), Chicago Region. “The FDIC OIG remains committed to working with our law enforcement partners to investigate allegations of fraud by bank insiders, as we seek to preserve the integrity of our Nation’s banking system and to protect depositors and financial consumers.”
From August 2022 through September 2024, Blassie is also accused of persuading a couple from Lebanon, Illinois, to give him $429,000 of their retirement savings. In return for this investment, Blassie gave the couple two promissory notes. He agreed to pay the couple interest on the notes and used money he obtained through his check kite scheme to pay some of that interest. As security for his promissory notes, Blassie pledged 128 of his and his wife’s shares of the holding company which owns the Bank of O’Fallon.
“This indictment sends a clear message that bank executives who engage in fraud that impacts the safety and soundness of financial institutions will be held accountable for their actions,” said Jon Ellwanger, Special Agent in Charge, Western Region, Office of Inspector General for the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
According to the indictment, Blassie later sold most of these shares and did not use those funds to repay the Lebanon couple. This left the couple with no means of recourse when Blassie later defaulted on the promissory notes.
“The Federal Housing Finance Agency, Office of Inspector General (FHFA-OIG) is committed to investigating allegations of fraud involving financial institutions, particularly the Federal Home Loan Banks,” said Korey Brinkman, Special Agent in Charge of the FHFA-OIG’s Central Region. “We are proud to have partnered with the U.S. Secret Service, FDIC OIG, FRB OIG, and the O’Fallon (IL) Police Department on this case.”
Officials with the Bank of O’Fallon have fully cooperated with law enforcement during the investigation.
An indictment is merely a formal charge against a defendant. Under the law, a defendant is presumed to be innocent of a charge until proved guilty beyond a reasonable doubt to the satisfaction of a jury.
Blassie’s first appearance is scheduled for 10 a.m. on April 23 at the federal courthouse in East St. Louis.
Convictions for bank fraud are punishable by up to 30 years’ imprisonment and interstate transportation of security or funds obtained by fraud can earn up to 10 years in federal prison.
The O’Fallon Police Department, U.S. Secret Service, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General, the Office of Inspector General for the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and the Federal Housing Finance Agency, Office of Inspector General made contributions to the investigation.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Scott Verseman is prosecuting the case.

New Jersey Co-Conspirators Plead Guilty in Connection With Scheme to Fraudulently Obtain Loans from Small Business Administration,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/new-jersey-co-conspirators-plead-guilty-connection-scheme,"April 9, 2025",2025,"Baltimore , Maryland – Mehul Ramesh Khatiwala, aka “Mike Khatiwala,” 43, of Voorhees, New Jersey, Rajendra G. Parikh, 64, of Monroe, New Jersey, and Jennifer H. Watkins, 48, of Marlton, New Jersey, pled guilty in federal court for their roles in a multi-million-dollar bank fraud conspiracy.  According to their plea agreements, Khatiwala, Parikh, Watkins, and their co-conspirators fraudulently obtained more than $35 million in Small Business Administration (SBA) loans from financial institutions that they used to purchase hotels.
Kelly O. Hayes, U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland, announced the guilty pleas with Special Agent in Charge Robert Manchak, Federal Housing Finance Agency Office of Inspector General (FHFA-OIG), and Special Agent in Charge Jeffrey D. Pittano, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC-OIG), Mid-Atlantic Region.
Khatiwala, Parikh, and Watkins each pled guilty to conspiracy to commit bank fraud.
According to the factual stipulations in the guilty pleas, Khatiwala was the owner and managing member of Delaware Hotel Group LLC (DHG), and an operator of GMK Consulting LLC (GMK) and KPG Hotel Mgmt. LLC (KPG). These LLCs were hotel management and loan brokerage companies located in Mount Laurel, New Jersey.  Watkins served as a project coordinator for DHG and managing member of Forza Consulting LLC (Forza), a hotel consulting and loan brokerage company located in Marlton, New Jersey.  Parkih was an owner of KPG.  Co-defendant Rebecca Marie Cohn a/k/a Rebecca Marie Stanton, 38, was a settlement and title processor for Residential Title & Escrow Company, a real estate title company located in Owings Mills, Maryland, that offered escrow and loan-settlement services. The guilty pleas outline how from August 2018 through February 2020, Khatiwala, Parikh, and Watkins conspired to obtain loan proceeds to buy and sell hotels in connection with a hotel flipping scheme. “Flipping” is a real estate investment strategy that involves purchasing property to hold for a short period before selling it to make a quick profit.  During the SBA-loan application process, the co-conspirators made and caused others to make material misrepresentations and omissions to financial institutions regarding the sellers’ identity, familial relationships between parties, and the nature and amount of the equity injected by the borrowers.  The defendants sought loans through the SBA’s Section 7(a) Program, which guaranteed and insured approximately 75-85 percent of these loans, and required that the small business owner/borrower invest a certain amount of their own money into the business to qualify for the loan.
In their guilty pleas, Khatiwala and Parikh admitted that they acted as managers or supervisors in connection with the scheme.  Additionally, Khatiwala, Parikh, and Watkins admitted that they created shell companies using co-conspirators as straw owners of the entities.  These straw owners had no actual ownership interest in the entities as Khatiwala and Parikh were the true owners.  The straw owners signed purchase contracts, operating agreements, and related documents to buy hotel properties in the name of the shell companies.
Co-conspirators then created a second company to purchase the hotels from the shell companies at substantially higher prices.  After the co-conspirators formed the companies to control both sides of the flip transaction, they solicited banks for small-business loans to finance the buying company’s purchase of the hotel from the straw companies.  The co-conspirators helped the buying companies qualify for the loans by falsely representing investors’ equity injections to the banks, among other material false statements, misrepresentations, and omissions.  The financial institutions extending the loans relied on the false statements and misrepresentations.
Khatiwala, Parikh, and Watkins are each facing a maximum sentence of 30 years in federal prison for conspiracy to commit bank fraud.
Actual sentences for federal crimes are typically less than the maximum penalties. A federal district court judge determines sentencing after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.

"Maryland Bank Teller Pleads Guilty to Stealing More Than $250,000 From Clients",https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/maryland-bank-teller-pleads-guilty-stealing-more-250000-clients,"April 3, 2025",2025,"Used position with bank to assist co-conspirators in withdrawing cash from victims’ accounts.
Greenbelt , Maryland – Today, Mountee Brown, 27, a former bank teller from Clinton, Maryland, pled guilty to bank fraud and aggravated identity theft in connection with a scheme to steal funds from bank customers.
Kelly O. Hayes, U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland, announced the guilty plea with Special Agent in Charge Jeffrey D. Pittano, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC-OIG), Mid-Atlantic Region.
According to his guilty plea, Brown worked as a bank teller with Bank A, located in Upper Marlboro, Maryland. In his role, he had access to the bank accounts of five victims, four of whom were over the age of 80. Between October and November 2022, Brown and his co-conspirators devised a scheme to use his position as a bank teller to make at least 26 unauthorized cash withdrawals involving the victims’ accounts.
The co-conspirators began carrying out the scheme on October 21, 2022, when Co-conspirator #1 entered Bank A and approached Brown at his designated teller station. Brown knew that Co-conspirator #1 was not Victim #1. But Brown and Co-conspirator #1 conducted a $10,000 cash withdrawal from Victim #1’s account without Victim #1’s knowledge or consent. Brown conducted the cash withdrawal by falsely documenting that he verified the customer, the customer was a “known client,” and that the customer was known by Brown’s supervisor. Co-conspirator #1 falsely signed the withdrawal ticket as Victim #1.
Then on October 22, 2022, Brown and Co-conspirator #1 conducted two additional unauthorized withdrawal transactions from Victim #1’s account totaling $20,000. The same day, Brown deposited approximately $4,300 in cash in an account at another financial institution.
On October 25, 2022, Co-conspirator #2 entered Bank A and approached Brown at his designated teller station. Brown knew that Co-conspirator #2 was not Victim #2. However, Brown and Co-conspirator #2 conducted a $10,000 cash withdrawal from Victim #2’s account without Victim #2’s knowledge or consent. Brown conducted the cash withdrawal by falsely documenting that he verified the customer, the customer was a “known client,” and the customer was known by Brown’s supervisor. Co-conspirator #2 falsely signed the withdrawal ticket as Victim #2.
On the same day, Co-conspirator #2 re-entered Bank A and approached Brown at his designated teller station. Brown and Co-conspirator #2 conducted a $10,000 cash withdrawal from Victim #3’s account, without Victim #3’s knowledge or consent. Brown conducted the cash withdrawal by falsely stating he verified the customer, the customer was a “known client,” and the customer was known by Brown’s supervisor. Co-conspirator #2 falsely signed the withdrawal ticket as Victim #3.
Between October 22, 2022, and December 6, 2022, Brown made cash deposits of approximately $30,200 into his personal account at another financial institution. As a result of his participation in the fraud, Brown and other co-conspirators obtained, directly or indirectly, an amount up to approximately $255,000.
U.S. Attorney Hayes commended the FDIC-OIG for its work in the investigation.  Ms. Hayes also thanked Assistant U.S. Attorneys Sean R. Delaney and Darren Gardner who are prosecuting the federal case.

Two Fiji Nationals Sentenced to Prison for Carrying Out Multi-Million Dollar Real Estate Short Sale Fraud,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/two-fiji-nationals-sentenced-prison-carrying-out-multi-million,"April 1, 2025",2025,"FRESNO , Calif. — Jyoteshna Karan, 52, and Praveen Singh, 45, both of Modesto, were sentenced for leading a multi-million dollar mortgage fraud scheme, Acting United States Attorney Michele Beckwith announced today.  Karan received three years and four months in prison, and Singh received two years.
According to court records, from 2006 through 2015, Karan and Singh conspired to make straw purchases and short sales of approximately 15 homes from Modesto to Sacramento.  A straw purchase is where one person buys a home on behalf of another person to get around certain restrictions.  Straw purchases are generally illegal in the real estate industry because they compromise lenders’ risk management practices.  A short sale is where a homeowner sells their home for less than the amount they owe on their mortgage, with lender approval, to avoid foreclosure.  Short sales must generally be arm’s length transactions in the real estate industry because that helps protect buyers and sellers from undervaluation, overpayment, and bias.
After Karan and Singh acquired the homes, they allowed them to go into foreclosure and arranged for short sales with the lenders.  They then quickly resold, or flipped, the homes to other people at market rates and therefore reaped significant profits.  In doing so, they caused the lenders to suffer over $3,000,000 in losses.
Karan and Singh were experienced real estate professionals who used unwitting participants, fabricated documents, and shell companies to carry out their fraud.  For example, they used Singh’s mother as one of the straw purchasers, fabricated documents to make it appear as though the straw purchasers worked for their shell companies making six figure salaries, and fabricated documents to make it appear as though the transactions were arm’s length.  This was all done to convince the lenders to go through with the deals.
This case is the product of an investigation by the FBI, FDIC OIG, and the Stanislaus County District Attorney’s Office.  Assistant United States Attorney Joseph Barton prosecuted the case.

"CEO of Company that Owned Rights to Notorious Drug Lord’s Name Extradited to United States to Face Fraud, Money Laundering Counts",https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/ceo-company-owned-rights-notorious-drug-lords-name-extradited,"March 28, 2025",2025,"LOS ANGELES – A Swedish national was extradited from Spain and was arraigned today on a 115-count federal indictment alleging he licensed the rights of the late Colombian narcoterrorist Pablo Escobar and defrauded investors by marketing and selling products – including flamethrowers and cellphones – that he never delivered.
Olaf Kyros Gustafsson, 31, a.k.a. “El Silencio,” arrived in Los Angeles this morning after Spanish authorities extradited him. Gustafsson is charged with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and mail fraud, nine counts of wire fraud, three counts of mail fraud, one count of conspiracy to engage in money laundering, 41 counts of money laundering, 35 counts of international money laundering, and 25 counts of engaging in monetary transactions in property derived from specified unlawful activity.
Gustafsson was arrested in Spain in December 2023 and was arraigned this afternoon in United States District Court in downtown Los Angeles. Gustafsson pleaded not guilty to the charges against him. A May 20 trial date was scheduled. A federal magistrate judge scheduled an April 3 detention hearing. Gustafsson remains in federal custody.
According to the indictment, Gustafsson was the CEO of Escobar Inc., a corporation registered in Puerto Rico that held successor-in-interest rights to the persona and legacy of Pablo Escobar, the deceased Colombian narcoterrorist and head of the Medellín Cartel. Escobar Inc. used Pablo Escobar’s likeness and persona to market and sell purported consumer products to the public.
From July 2019 to November 2023, Gustafsson identified existing products in the marketplace that were being manufactured and sold to the public. He then used the Escobar persona to market and advertise similar and competing products purportedly being sold by Escobar Inc., advertising them at a price substantially lower than existing counterparts being sold by other companies.
Gustafsson then purportedly sold the products – including an Escobar Flamethrower, an Escobar Fold Phone, an Escobar Gold 11 Pro Phone, and Escobar Cash (marketed as a “physical cryptocurrency”) – to customers, receiving payments via PayPal, Stripe, Coinbase, among other payment processors.
Despite receiving customer payments, Gustafsson did not deliver the Escobar Inc. products to paying customers because the products did not exist.
In furtherance of the scheme, Gustafsson sent crudely made samples of the purported Escobar Inc. products to online technology reviewers and social media influencers to attempt to increase the public’s demand for them. For example, Gustafsson allegedly sent Samsung Galaxy Fold Phones wrapped in gold foil and disguised as Escobar Inc. phones to online technology reviewers to attempt to induce victims who watched the online reviews into buying the products that never would be delivered.
Also, rather than sending paying customers the actual products, Gustafsson mailed them a “Certificate of Ownership,” a book or other Escobar Inc. promotional materials so there was a record of mailing from the company to the customer. When a paying customer attempted to obtain a refund when the product was never delivered, Gustafsson fraudulently referred the payment processor to the proof of mailing for the Certificate of Ownership or other material as proof that the product itself was shipped and that the customer had received it so the refund requests would be denied.
Some of the victims include residents of Los Angeles, Gardena, and Commerce.
Gustafsson allegedly also caused bank accounts to be opened under his name and entities he controlled to be used as funnel accounts – bank accounts into which he deposited and withdrew proceeds derived from his criminal activities. The purpose was to conceal and disguise the nature, location, source, ownership, and control of the proceeds. The bank accounts were located in the United States, Sweden, and the United Arab Emirates.
An indictment is merely an allegation. All defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.
IRS Criminal Investigation, the FBI, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation-Office of Inspector General are investigating this matter, with assistance from the Department of Justice’s Office of International Affairs, the United States Marshals Service, Eurojust, Spanish authorities, and French judicial authorities.

"Mortgage Broker That Ran a Ponzi Scheme, Fraudulently Acquired CARES Act SBA Loans, and Filed a False Tax Return is Sentenced to Federal Prison",https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/mortgage-broker-ran-ponzi-scheme-fraudulently-acquired-cares-act,"March 27, 2025",2025,"PROVIDENCE, RI – A Rhode Island mortgage broker who ran a Ponzi scheme with investors’ monies causing millions of dollars in losses, who fraudulently obtained more than $160,000 in COVID-19 pandemic-related SBA loans, and who failed to pay more than $140,000 in taxes due the IRS was sentenced today to more than four years in federal prison and was ordered to pay restitution to his victims, announced Acting United States Attorney Sara Miron Bloom.
Joseph Giuttari, owner and operator of Hybrid Capital Group, LLC, THE FENS CO., LLC, and Realty Funding Advisors, LLC, was sentenced by U.S. District Court Judge Melissa R. DuBose to 55 months of incarceration to be followed by three years of supervised release. Additionally, Giuttari was ordered to pay a fine of $20,000 and to pay restitution to victims of his Ponzi scheme, to SBA loan programs, and to the IRS totaling $4,579,130.95.
Mr. Giuttari pleaded guilty on October 31, 2024, to charges of wire fraud, theft of government property, and filing a false tax return.  The day after his guilty plea he engaged in brokerage activities in violation of his condition of release.  Upon discovery of his activities, the Court revoked its order of release and remanded him to the custody of the U.S. Marshal pending sentencing.
Court documents reflect that Joseph Giuttari purported to match borrowers seeking short-term loans with private lenders seeking secured investments in real estate. As part of the scheme, Giuttari served as the clearing house for funds between the borrowers and the investors. In executing his scheme, Giuttari directed investors and closing attorneys to send all or a portion of the loan proceeds directly to him through his multiple business entities and business bank accounts. Instead of forwarding these funds to borrowers as represented to the investors, Giuttari used the money personally or to repay earlier investors who were seeking a return on their investments.
Additionally, Giuttari fraudulently acquired $167,800 in COVID-19 pandemic Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL) for Hybrid Capital Group and THE FENS CO that he was not entitled to receive, and he falsely stated on his 2019 U.S. Individual Income Tax Return that his total income was $22,176, when in fact it was at least $541,000, thus failing to pay $140,102 due the IRS.
The case was prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Sandra R. Hebert.
The matter was investigated by the FBI, Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation, and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General.

"Par Funding CEO Sentenced to 15½ Years in Prison for RICO Conspiracy, Securities Fraud, Tax Crimes, and Related Offenses",https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/par-funding-ceo-sentenced-15-12-years-prison-rico-conspiracy,"March 26, 2025",2025,"PHILADELPHIA – United States Attorney David Metcalf announced that Joseph LaForte, 54, of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, was sentenced today by United States District Court Judge Mark A. Kearney to 186 months in prison and three years of supervised release, to include 12 months in home confinement, for numerous crimes arising from the defendant’s operation of a fraudulent investment vehicle known as Complete Business Solutions Group Inc. d/b/a Par Funding (“Par Funding”). In addition, LaForte was sentenced to forfeit various assets, including a private jet and an investment account totaling approximately $20 million, along with a $120 million forfeiture money judgment, as well as restitution in the amount of $314 million, and a $50,000 fine.
In January 2025, the Court found the Par Funding fraud scheme caused an actual fraud loss of approximately $404,000,000, which it reduced to $288,395,088 after factoring in credit for collateral that federal authorities seized from Par Funding when the investigation became public in July 2020, upon the SEC placing Par Funding in receivership.
The defendant, who functioned as Par Funding’s president and CEO, his brother James LaForte, Par Funding’s “enforcer,” and Joseph Cole Barleta, Par Funding’s chief financial officer, were charged in a February 2024 amended second superseding indictment with racketeering conspiracy and related crimes.
In September 2024, Joseph LaForte pleaded guilty to the RICO charge, securities fraud, tax crimes, and perjury. He also pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice for his role in aiding and abetting James LaForte’s violent assault on one of the receivership’s Philadelphia attorneys, and to a gun possession charge for firearms found in his former residence during the execution of a search warrant.
James LaForte pleaded guilty in September 2024 to racketeering conspiracy, securities fraud, and extortionate collection of debt, as well as obstruction of justice, for his assault on the receivership attorney, and retaliation, for threatening several government witnesses. He was sentenced earlier this month to 11½ years in prison.
Barleta pleaded guilty in October 2024 to one count of racketeering conspiracy and is scheduled to be sentenced on June 2, 2025.
***
As detailed in court filings, the defendant served as the undisputed leader of a years-long criminal enterprise consisting of his codefendants and others. The principal purpose of this enterprise was to generate money for its leadership and members, primarily by defrauding the investors in Par Funding, which the enterprise controlled until it was placed in receivership.
Joseph LaForte and his conspirators caused false and misleading information to be conveyed to investors regarding various issues, including:
▪ Joseph LaForte’s true name, his role at Par Funding, and his criminal history;
▪ Par Funding’s underwriting process;
▪ the diversity of the company’s MCA portfolio;
▪ Par Funding’s default rate;
▪ Par Funding’s financial success and profitability;
▪ the company’s insurance; and
▪ the defendants’ self-dealing.
Par Funding’s principal means of generating income was to “advance” money to businesses (known as merchant cash advance or “MCA” customers) that were in need of short-term financing at high rates of return.
The enterprise would use threats of violence to collect money from customers whose payments were overdue. James LaForte admitted that, in threatening one particular Par Funding customer, he told the customer that he must repay the company immediately because James LaForte was not to be messed with and had previously torched people’s cars and kicked people’s teeth in.
Another Par Funding collector admitted to extorting multiple customers at Joseph LaForte’s direction, including through threats of physical harm to the customers or their families if the debt was not paid back. And as established at his sentencing hearing, Joseph LaForte also threatened and extorted customers who fell behind in their payments, such as by telling a Par Funding customer to keep paying her debts or he would bomb her car, kidnap her children, and outfit her with “cement shoes” to sink her to the bottom of the Hudson River.
The reality hidden from Par Funding’s investors was that, during every year from 2016 through mid-2020, Par Funding’s MCA business was not profitable enough to repay the money owed to Par Funding’s investors while also covering its operating expenses (including tens of millions of dollars Joseph LaForte was paying himself annually). LaForte thus needed to acquire increasingly large injections of new investor money just to keep the lights on and the business running, a hallmark of a traditional Ponzi scheme.
From 2015 until the unraveling of the fraud in mid-2020, Joseph LaForte caused Par Funding to pay him and his wife more than $120,000,000 in fraudulent proceeds, with which he purchased homes, vacation properties, vehicles, artwork, jewelry, dozens of investment properties, a boat, and a private jet. LaForte rewarded the loyalty of co-conspirators, including James LaForte and Cole Barleta, by making each of them multi-millionaires.
For years, the defendant committed a variety of tax crimes related to his fraudulent proceeds, including conspiring to defraud the IRS and filing false tax returns, as well as employment tax fraud. The total federal tax loss stemming from LaForte’s crimes exceeds $8 million. He also caused $1.6 million in state tax loss to the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue by falsely reporting that he and his wife were residents of Florida from 2013 through 2019, when in fact they resided in Pennsylvania.
“Joe LaForte is a career grifter,” said U.S. Attorney Metcalf. “He has spent his adult life lying, cheating, and stealing his way to a lavish lifestyle paid for with other people’s money. Consider LaForte’s vast criminality here: a decade’s worth of financial and tax crimes, acts of obstruction, perjury, extortionate threats, the aiding and abetting of his brother’s violent assault on an attorney, and the illegal possession of multiple guns. He has earned every day of his prison sentence. My office is committed to prosecuting these complex financial cases, to bring fraud victims some relief and the crooks who victimized them to justice.”
“Today’s sentencing holds Joseph LaForte accountable for the full scope of his criminal conduct in leading a long-running fraudulent enterprise,” said Wayne A. Jacobs, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI’s Philadelphia Field Office. “The FBI and our partners remain unwavering in our commitment to uncover, investigate, and dismantle complex financial fraud schemes — and to pursue justice and restitution for the victims they leave behind.”
“This case exemplifies how cooperative law enforcement efforts lead to the exposure of individuals and groups seeking to circumvent our laws for financial gain,” said IRS Criminal Investigation Special Agent in Charge Yury Kruty. “An investigation such as this takes a dedicated team of investigators and prosecutors many hours of hard work and sacrifice to bring to a successful conclusion.”
“Today’s sentencing brings Joseph LaForte to justice for operating a fraudulent investment vehicle that he and his co-conspirators used to generate hundreds of millions of dollars illegally, while harming Par Funding’s numerous investors,” said Patricia Tarasca, Special Agent in Charge of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC OIG), New York Region. “The FDIC OIG will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to hold accountable those who deceive investors for their own selfish gain and threaten the safety and soundness of our Nation’s financial system.”
The case was investigated by the FBI, Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General, and is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys Matthew Newcomer, Samuel Dalke, and Eric Gill, as well as Assistant U.S. Attorney John J. Boscia and DOJ Trial Attorney Ezra Spiro on the tax portion of the prosecution.
The SEC in Florida investigated and litigated the civil securities fraud charges, which formed the basis of a portion of the criminal prosecution.

Maryland Man Sentenced to Federal Prison for Pandemic Relief Loan Fraud and Commercial Loan Fraud,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/maryland-man-sentenced-federal-prison-pandemic-relief-loan-fraud,"March 19, 2025",2025,"Defendant admitted to spending portions of fraudulent-loan proceeds on a Lamborghini and home renovations.
Greenbelt , Maryland – U.S. District Judge Lydia K. Griggsby sentenced Andra Shirone Thompson, 48, of Silver Spring, Maryland, to a year and a day for two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud.
Thompson pled guilty to conspiring to defraud Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act loan programs and his role in a years-long scheme to defraud commercial equipment financing companies. He was also sentenced to three years of supervised released and ordered to forfeit $847,280, and pay $813,363.01 in restitution to the victims of his schemes.
Kelly O. Hayes, U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland, made the announcement with Supervisory Official Matthew Galeotti, Justice Department’s Criminal Division; Executive Special Agent in Charge Kareem Carter, IRS Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI) Washington, D.C., Field Office; Jeffrey D. Pittano, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC-OIG), Mid-Atlantic Region; Special Agent in Charge Amaleka McCall-Braithwaite, Small Business Administration Office of Inspector General (SBA-OIG), Eastern Region; and Special Agent in Charge William J. DelBagno of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) – Baltimore Field Office.
According to his guilty plea, Thompson admitted to participating in a conspiracy to submit fraudulent applications for Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL) and Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans on behalf of companies he controlled. The companies included Alpha Bravo Tango LLC., Senergy Consulting Group Inc., and Novus Ordo Seclorum LLC. Through the scheme, Thompson fraudulently obtained $716,375. He spent a portion of the proceeds on vehicles, including a 2014 Lamborghini Aventador, and on renovating a home in North Carolina.
Thompson also joined a conspiracy to defraud equipment financing companies by submitting fraudulent invoices that falsely showed the sale of substantial quantities of computer servers and related equipment. Thompson and his co-conspirators caused borrowers to submit fraudulent invoices to lenders to support their loan applications to purchase items. After approval, lenders deposited loan proceeds into accounts controlled by Thompson and his co-conspirators. The lenders were unaware that the sales on the invoices never occurred. Thompson and his co-conspirators typically “kicked back” a portion of the proceeds to the borrower who submitted the application and kept the rest for themselves. Thompson personally participated in three executions of this scheme, causing approximately $813,362 in fraudulently induced lending.
Additionally, the co-conspirators caused more than $60 million of fraudulently induced lending across more than 350 separate loans through this scheme. Thompson’s principal co-conspirator, Craig David Davis, 49, of Venice, California, pleaded guilty to wire fraud in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia and was sentenced earlier this month to 93 months incarceration.
Financial assistance offered through the CARES Act included forgivable loans to small businesses for job retention and other expenses, through the PPP, administered through the Small Business Administration (SBA).  The SBA also offered an EIDL and/or an EIDL advance to help businesses meet their financial obligations.

"Former Principals of Aerospace Start-Up Company Charged with Fraud, Fraud Conspiracy, and Tax Evasion",https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/former-principals-aerospace-start-company-charged-fraud-fraud,"March 18, 2025",2025,"WASHINGTON – An indictment was unsealed today charging five former principals of aerospace start-up company Theia Group, Inc.—Erlend Olson, John Gallagher, Stephen Buscher, Joseph Fargnoli, and Jamil Swati—with a multi-year scheme to defraud investors and lenders out of $250 million, and further charging Olson with evading more than $3.9 million in personal federal income taxes. Theia Group, Inc. (Theia) had its headquarters in Washington D.C.
Law enforcement made arrests yesterday in Albuquerque, New Mexico (Olson), Memphis, Tennessee (Buscher), and today in Broomall, Pennsylvania (Gallagher), Rochester, New York (Fargnoli), and Bridgeport, Connecticut (Swati).
The indictment was announced by U.S. Attorney Edward R. Martin, Jr. Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General Karen E. Kelly of the Justice Department’s Tax Division, Special Agent in Charge Jeffrey D. Pittano of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) Office of Inspector General, and Executive Special Agent in Charge Kareem Carter of the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI) Washington D.C. Office.
According to the indictment, Theia planned to launch 112 satellites starting in 2022 at a cost of $10 billion to $15 billion. Theia’s principals originally planned to raise the requisite funds from various nation-states by promising perpetual data and analytics for an upfront cost of $2 billion. However, from Theia’s founding in 2015 through its placement into receivership in 2021, Theia was unsuccessful in obtaining any funding except for approximately $250 million in loans and investments that Theia’s principals induced by fraud. Olson, Gallagher, Buscher, Fargnoli, and Swati’s fraud scheme allegedly included materially false statements about revenue from non-existent government contracts, provision of multiple false financial statements, including a fake $6 billion escrow account statement, and false representations about Theia’s technical capabilities.
The indictment further alleges that, between 2018 and 2020, Theia’s founder, Erlend Olson, concealed from the IRS millions of dollars in compensation he received from Theia. In addition to not filing tax returns or paying any taxes for 2018 through 2020, Olson allegedly directed his compensation from Theia to a nominee entity called Meridian Vector Corporation (MVC). Olson then used MVC funds to pay personal expenses such as personal debts, a private jet membership, $64,500 annual rent payments for his home, a new Land Rover, and a pair of condominiums in Las Vegas. Olson also allegedly evaded payment of taxes that he owed the IRS for tax years 2009 through 2011 by directing that his pay and bonuses not be reported to the IRS.
Olson, Gallagher, Buscher, Fargnoli, and Swati are each charged with one count of conspiracy to commit wire and mail fraud. Olson also is charged with five counts of wire fraud, one count of mail fraud, and four counts of tax evasion. Gallagher is also charged with five counts of wire fraud and one count of mail fraud. Buscher also is charged with three counts of wire fraud. Fargnoli is also charged with two counts of wire fraud. Swati is also charged with one count of wire fraud.
If convicted, Olson, Gallagher, Buscher, Fargnoli, and Swati face up to 20 years in prison for the conspiracy count, as well as up to 20 years in prison for each wire fraud or mail fraud count. Each also face a period of supervised release, restitution, monetary penalties, and forfeiture. Olson faces up to five years in prison for each tax evasion count. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.
FDIC Office of Inspector General and IRS Criminal Investigation is investigating the case.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Rebecca G. Ross, and Assistant U.S. Attorney Joshua Gold of the District of Columbia, Senior Litigation Counsel Nanette Davis, and Trial Attorney Alexis Hughes of the Tax Division are prosecuting the case.

PHILADELPHIA – United States Attorney David Metcalf announced that James LaForte, 48, of New York, New York, was sentenced today by United States District Court Judge Mark A. Kearney to 137 months’ imprisonment, followed by three years of supervised release to include 12 months’ home confinement, for crimes committed as part of a criminal enterprise that ran a fraudulent investment vehicle [1] known as Complete Business Solutions Group, Inc., d/b/a Par Funding (“Par Funding”) for a number of years, before it was taken over by a court-appointed receivership pursuant to a lawsuit filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. LaForte was also ordered to pay $2,488,645 in restitution, representing the portion of investor proceeds that he illegally diverted from Par Funding’s numerous investors for his own use through sham merchant contracts and other self-dealing conduct.
In February 2024, the defendant, his brother Joseph LaForte, Par Funding’s president and CEO, and Joseph Cole Barleta, Par Funding’s chief financial officer, were charged in an amended second superseding indictment with racketeering conspiracy and related crimes.
James LaForte pleaded guilty in September 2024 to racketeering conspiracy, securities fraud, and extortionate collection of debt, as well as obstruction of justice, for his violent assault on one of the Par Funding receivership’s Philadelphia attorneys, and retaliation, for threatening several government witnesses.
“James LaForte served as one of his brother’s enforcers,” said U.S. Attorney Metcalf. “He not only used threats of violence to collect on Par Funding’s debt, but stalked and assaulted an attorney, in retaliation for that man’s efforts to hold the LaForte family responsible for one of the largest financial frauds in Philadelphia’s history. As today’s sentence shows, this brand of brazen and violent lawbreaking simply won’t be tolerated in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.”
“Since its earliest days, the FBI has been dedicated to investigating complex financial crimes,” said Wayne A. Jacobs, Special Agent in Charge of FBI Philadelphia. “James LaForte participated in a criminal enterprise driven by greed and sustained through threats and violence. The FBI is proud to stand with our partners in the pursuit of justice — disrupting these schemes and ensuring restitution for victims.”
“The defendant in this case was brought to justice for his participation in a criminal enterprise that caused significant financial harm to numerous investors,” said Special Agent in Charge Patricia Tarasca of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC OIG), New York Region. “The FDIC OIG will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to pursue those who commit such egregious crimes that threaten investors and the safety and soundness of our Nation's financial institutions.”
Joseph LaForte also pleaded guilty in September 2024 to racketeering conspiracy, securities fraud, and related crimes and is scheduled to be sentenced on March 26, 2025. Barleta pleaded guilty in October 2024 to one count of racketeering conspiracy and is scheduled to be sentenced on June 2, 2025.
This case was investigated by the FBI, Internal Revenue Service - Criminal Investigation, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General, and prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys Matthew Newcomer, Samuel Dalke, and Eric Gill.
The SEC in Florida investigated and litigated the civil securities fraud charges, which formed the basis of a portion of the Par Funding criminal prosecution.
[1] On January 21, 2025, the Court found the Par Funding fraud scheme caused an actual fraud loss of approximately $404,000,000, which it reduced to $288,395,088 after factoring in credit for collateral seized from Par Funding by federal authorities when the investigation became public in July 2020.

Georgia Businessman Pleads Guilty to Bank Fraud and Making False Statements to the Department of Veterans Affairs,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/georgia-businessman-pleads-guilty-bank-fraud-and-making-false,"March 13, 2025",2025,"ATLANTA – Spencer Askew, the founder and former CEO of E-Freight Solutions Worldwide, LLC, a Georgia-based logistics and supply chain company, pleaded guilty to defrauding Vinings Bank in connection with obtaining a $1 million line of credit. Askew also pleaded guilty to making false statements to the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) in June 2020, falsely claiming that he had a relationship with 3M and could supply the VA with KN95-like masks during the COVID-19 pandemic.
“Askew can no longer avoid the consequences of engaging in a fraudulent scheme that resulted in the loss of millions of dollars and of aggravating his criminal conduct by making false statements to law enforcement,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Richard S. Moultrie, Jr. “This prosecution underscores our commitment to work with agency partners to combat all forms of fraud and deception.”
“The defendant in this case was brought to justice for submitting falsified financial information about his companies to financial institutions in order to fraudulently obtain millions of dollars in loans and lines of credit,” said Special Agent in Charge Kyle A. Myles, of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of Inspector General, Atlanta Region. “The FDIC OIG will continue to work diligently with our law enforcement partners to investigate and hold accountable those who commit such fraudulent offenses that threaten the safety and soundness of our Nation’s financial institutions.”
“This guilty plea holds the defendant accountable for his egregious attempt to exploit VA programs and services during a global pandemic,” said Special Agent in Charge David Spilker, Department of Veterans Affairs, Office of Inspector General’s Southeast Field Office. “The VA OIG is dedicated to working with our law enforcement partners to ensure schemes like this are uncovered, investigated, and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”
According to Acting U.S. Attorney Moultrie, the charges, and other information presented in court: Askew started E-Freight Solutions Worldwide, LLC in March 2010. E-Freight Solutions was a logistics and supply company that provided a network for carriers and suppliers of goods to partner and arrange the transportation of goods. In May 2015, Askew founded another entity, Techknowlogi Holdings, LLC d/b/a Teknowlogi. Teknowlogi conducted little or no actual business. Between February and April 2018, Askew executed a scheme to defraud Vinings Bank to obtain financing on behalf of Teknowlogi.
Initially, Askew falsely claimed to Vinings Bank that he was seeking the financing to acquire another logistics company, SaaS Transportation. But ultimately he obtained the financing by submitting materially false information regarding the nature of Teknowlogi’s business and financial condition. Also, several years later, in June 2020, Askew repeatedly lied to a federal special agent about his ability to provide protective personal equipment – KN-95-like masks – to the VA during the COVID-19 pandemic.
In April 2023, a federal grand jury returned a sealed indictment against Askew, charging him with bank fraud and money laundering. In April 2024, Askew was arrested in Arizona after crossing the border from Mexico. Under the terms of his plea agreement, Askew agreed to pay more than $6 million in restitution.
On March 6, 2025, Spencer Askew, 46, of Newnan, Georgia, pleaded guilty to a criminal information charging him with one count of bank fraud and one count of making false statements to a federal agency. His sentencing is scheduled on May 15, 2025, at 10:00 am, before Chief U.S. District Judge Timothy C. Batten, Sr.

Santa Maria Investment Advisor Pleads Guilty to Defrauding Elderly Clients Out of More Than $2 Million,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/santa-maria-investment-advisor-pleads-guilty-defrauding-elderly,"March 4, 2025",2025,"LOS ANGELES – A Santa Barbara County investment advisor pleaded guilty today to stealing approximately $2.25 million from elderly clients of her investment advisory business – some of whom were receiving end-of-life care.
Julie Anne Darrah, 52, of Santa Maria, pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud. She remains free on $50,000 bond.
Darrah ran a Santa Maria-based investment advisory business called Vivid Financial Management Inc. (VFM). At all relevant times, she was an investment advisor registered with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and, from 2015 to 2021, she was the president, chief compliance officer, and a one-third shareholder of VFM.
During the scheme, Darrah stole approximately $2.25 million from her firm’s clients. She did so by obtaining control of her victims’ assets, and then – without the victims’ knowledge or consent – she liquidated their security holdings and transferred the proceeds to accounts she controlled. As part of this, she convinced victims to sign documents making her the trustee of their trusts or a signatory on their bank accounts or giving her power of attorney over their brokerage accounts and allowing her – as their investment advisor – to transfer funds from their accounts to other bank accounts, including to her own accounts.
Darrah took advantage of trust victims placed in her -- often convincing them she would take care of them in their older years like a daughter, and she used this trust to convince them to sign the documents that she then used to steal money from them. In this way, Darrah stole money from victims from approximately November 2016 to July 2023. She used stolen funds to buy properties for herself, pay other personal expenses, buy luxury vehicles, and operate other business ventures. Some victims were left in desperate circumstances, without the money to pay for end-of-life care, when the fraud was discovered.
Darrah also convinced a company identified in the plea agreement as “Business Victim 1,” a Minnesota-based investment advisor firm, to acquire VFM based on false and misleading statements and the concealment of material facts, including not telling that firm about her theft of individual client funds.  After the fraud was discovered, Business Victim 1 incurred approximately $5.4 million in losses.
“The defendant took advantage of her clients’ trust,” said Acting United States Attorney Joseph McNally. “Many of them were elderly and she stole from them using their funds as her own. Our seniors should never have to question whether their money is safe. She will now be held accountable for her actions.”
United States District Judge Otis D. Wright II scheduled a May 19 sentencing hearing, at which time Darrah will face a statutory maximum sentence of 20 years in federal prison.
In October 2023, the SEC filed a civil complaint against Darrah in connection with this scheme. In December 2024, United States District Judge Dale S. Fischer found Darrah liable to pay $2,416,511, including interest.
The FBI and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General investigated this matter.
Assistant United States Attorney Kerry L. Quinn of the Major Frauds Section is prosecuting this case.

Suburban Chicago Tax Professional Sentenced to More Than Ten Years in Prison for Stealing Client and Investor Funds,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/suburban-chicago-tax-professional-sentenced-more-ten-years,"February 28, 2025",2025,"CHICAGO — A suburban Chicago tax professional who fraudulently obtained more than $2.5 million from clients and investors under false pretenses has been sentenced to more than ten years in federal prison.
ADAM R. OLIVA, 43, of Rolling Meadows, Ill., pleaded guilty last year in two federal fraud cases.  Oliva was sentenced in December to six years in federal prison for one of the cases, and on Wednesday he received an additional four-and-a-half-year sentence for the other case.  The prison terms must be served consecutively, for a total period of incarceration of ten and a half years.
In one case, Oliva held himself out as a tax professional who did business under various names, including Oliva and Associates LLC and The Oliva Group LLC.  From 2015 to 2020, Oliva fraudulently induced clients to provide him with money for the purported purpose of paying their income taxes.  Oliva instead kept the money for himself.  Oliva also admitted that he filed false tax returns on behalf of some of those clients, reflecting no or lower tax liabilities in order to make it less likely that the IRS would contact the clients about their unpaid tax liabilities.
In the other case, Oliva duped investors who had provided him with money to fund purported short-term loans to clients.  Oliva promised those investors that they would receive returns of 10-20% on their investments.  In reality, he never intended to make any short-term loans.  Instead, he pocketed the investors’ money and used it for personal expenses, including gambling, meals at restaurants, and retail purchases.
The sentences were announced by Morris Pasqual, Acting United States Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois, Ramsey E. Covington, Acting Special Agent-in-Charge of IRS Criminal Investigation Chicago Field Office, and Vincent R. Zehme, Special Agent-in-Charge of the Chicago Region of the FDIC’s Office of Inspector General.  The government was represented by Assistant U.S. Attorney Rick D. Young.

Owner Of Las Vegas Company Indicted In $24 Million Cryptocurrency Ponzi Scheme,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/owner-las-vegas-company-indicted-24-million-cryptocurrency-ponzi,"February 14, 2025",2025,"LAS VEGAS – A Las Vegas business owner made his initial appearance in court yesterday for allegedly misrepresenting that his company was a profitable, up-and-running artificial intelligence company that mined cryptocurrency, verified cryptocurrency transactions, paid fixed rates of return on investments, and provided a 100% money back guarantee. In total, the defendant obtained approximately $24 million from at least 400 investors.
“Mr. Kovar allegedly stole victims’ hard-earned money by making false representations regarding his investment company, including misleading some victims to believe their investments were backed by the FDIC,” said Ryan Korner, Special Agent in Charge with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC OIG). “FDIC OIG is committed to identifying, and holding accountable, those who endanger our Nation’s financial system by victimizing others for their personal gain.”
Brent C. Kovar, 58, is charged with 12 counts of wire fraud, three counts of mail fraud, and three counts of money laundering. A jury trial has been scheduled to begin on April 8, 2025, before United States District Judge Jennifer A. Dorsey.
According to allegations contained in the indictment, from late 2017 to July 2021, Kovar owned Profit Connect, a Las Vegas, Nev., based company that purportedly used artificial intelligence software on a supercomputer to mine cryptocurrency and verify cryptocurrency transactions. He falsely represented to investors that Profit Connect paid a fixed rate of return of 15%-30% APR and provided a 100% money-back guarantee. In reality, Kovar used investor money to operate Profit Connect, buy gifts for employees, buy a house for himself, and repay investors as if those repayments came from mining cryptocurrency and verifying cryptocurrency transactions.
As part of the scheme, Kovar created a website, a YouTube video, and a PowerPoint presentation in which he made the misrepresentations to influence customers to buy investments. Furthermore, he leased office space for a sales office and a warehouse for a data center. As alleged, investments were sold through an entity known as Profit Connect Wealth Services. Kovar sent money via wire transfers to investors, he mailed checks through the U.S. Postal Service, and he engaged in monetary transactions greater than $10,000 that were derived from unlawful activity.
If convicted, Kovar faces a total maximum statutory penalty of 330 years in prison and a fine of not more than $4,500,000. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.

Sacramento Woman Pleads Guilty to Participation in Nearly $2.6 Million COVID-19 Benefit Fraud Scheme,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/sacramento-woman-pleads-guilty-participation-nearly-26-million,"February 13, 2025",2025,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. —Tabitha Leigh Markle, 53, of Sacramento, pleaded guilty today to mail fraud and aggravated identity theft in a scheme to defraud the unemployment insurance benefit program during the COVID-19 pandemic, Acting U.S. Attorney Michele Beckwith announced.
According to court documents, between April 2020 and January 2021, Markle defrauded the California Employment Development Department (EDD) and the United States out of unemployment insurance benefits. Markle collected personally identifiable information (PII) including names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers and other information, and submitted fraudulent applications for unemployment insurance (UI) benefits to EDD. Markle and her associates caused the UI debit cards to be mailed to addresses she listed in the fraudulent applications. They used the cards that were issued in the names of the supposed beneficiaries to withdraw cash from ATMs throughout California. Markle and her associates often appeared in ATM surveillance photos taking out large amounts of cash from the cards. Markle and her criminal associates obtained approximately $2,599,038 from the fraud.
Markle also used the means of identification of various victims, including N.T., who was a resident of Oakland. Without N.T.’s knowledge or permission, Markle filed a false unemployment insurance application with California EDD using N.T.’s true name and other identifying information, but using a false email address, phone number and mailing address. Markle’s associates withdrew thousands of dollars of unemployment insurance benefits from the card issued to N.T.
This case is the product of an investigation by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General, California EDD – Investigation Division, and the United States Department of Labor Office of Inspector General. Assistant U.S. Attorney Christina McCall is prosecuting the case.
Markle is scheduled to be sentenced by U.S. District Judge Troy L. Nunley on May 13, 2025. Markle faces a maximum statutory penalty of 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine (or twice the amount of the loss) for mail fraud, plus supervised release of up to five years. She also faces a mandatory two-year consecutive prison and a fine of up to $250,000 for aggravated identity theft. The actual sentence, however, will be determined at the discretion of the Court after consideration of any applicable statutory factors and the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, which take into account a number of variables.
This effort is part of a California COVID-19 Fraud Enforcement Strike Force operation, one of five interagency COVID-19 fraud strike force teams established by the U.S. Department of Justice. The California Strike Force combines law enforcement and prosecutorial resources in the Eastern and Central Districts of California and focuses on large-scale, multistate pandemic relief fraud perpetrated by criminal organizations and transnational actors. The strike forces use prosecutor-led and data analyst-driven teams to identify and bring to justice those who stole pandemic relief funds.

Lexington Man Sentenced for Fraudulently Obtaining COVID Relief Loans and COVID Relief Rental Assistance,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/lexington-man-sentenced-fraudulently-obtaining-covid-relief,"January 27, 2025",2025,"LEXINGTON, Ky. – A Lexington man, Vonnie McDaniels, 35, was sentenced on Friday, by Chief U.S. District Judge Danny Reeves, to 96 months, for wire fraud and other charges related to COVID relief programs.
Specifically, McDaniels was convicted in September 2024 of four counts of wire fraud, for fraudulently applying for three Small Business Administration (SBA) COVID-19 relief loans and for fraudulently applying to the Lexington Fayette Urban County Government’s (LFUCG) federally funded Housing Stabilization Program (HSP), a tenant rent relief program; two counts of aggravated identity theft for submitting tenant rent relief applications, pretending to be his tenants; six counts of money laundering; and two counts of committing an offense while on conditions of release.
According to the evidence at trial, McDaniels submitted a materially false application to the SBA, to obtain an Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EDIL), for one business, fraudulently obtaining a $100,000 loan.  The Defendant also submitted three materially false Payment Protection Program (PPP) applications, for the same business and for another business that was no longer in operation at the time of the pandemic.  Two of the three PPP applications were eventually funded, and McDaniels obtained $93,231.  McDaniels also inflated numbers on his applications to increase the loan amount and uploaded fraudulent tax documents to support his numbers.  In 2020, he obtained a total of $193,231 in disaster relief funds from the SBA.  The theft was discovered by law enforcement when preparing for an earlier trial, in June 2021, when McDaniels was previously convicted of bank fraud and aggravated identity theft.
McDaniels used the SBA loan proceeds to pay off personal credit cards and loans, free up home equity lines of credit, purchase a new property in South Carolina, and pay his unlawfully obtained mortgage, which had been the subject of his June 2021 bank fraud trial.
In 2021, McDaniels also submitted a materially false application to LFUCG’s HSP for tenant rent relief for two properties.  McDaniels uploaded fraudulent leases, vastly inflating the monthly rent amount and pretended to be his two tenants when he submitted the tenant portions of the application.  McDaniels solicited personal identifying information from his tenants, told his tenants about the rent relief program, and informed his tenants that they did not qualify.  Then, he fraudulently obtained $45,000 in COVID rental relief assistance, while he continued to make his tenants pay their monthly rent.  He committed these offenses while subject to conditions of release, following his prior conviction.
Under federal law, McDaniels must serve 85 percent of his prison sentence.  Upon his release from prison, he will be under the supervision of the U.S. Probation Office for three years. McDaniels was also ordered to pay $262,017.43 in restitution.

Tamara Starks, 42, of Mansfield, pleaded guilty in September 2024 to wire fraud.  She was sentenced Thursday to 86 months in federal prison by U.S. District Judge Mark Pittman, who also ordered her to pay $4,476,523.73 in restitution.
According to court documents, from approximately May 2020 to May 2021, Ms. Starks devised a scheme to defraud the PPP program through materially false pretenses.  As part of the scheme, Ms. Starks created and submitted fraudulent PPP loan applications that included false payroll information and tax documentation for companies owned by her and her husband.  She also obtained PPP loans for other individuals.
In total, Ms. Starks, and others working with her, submitted more than 100 PPP loan applications totaling approximately $8.5 million and received $4.5 million in PPP loan funds.
Once the loans were funded, Ms. Starks directed loan recipients to set up fraudulent payrolls through third-party vendors to make the PPP funds appear as though they were being used for legitimate purposes.  In many cases, Ms. Starks received money back from their “employees” and used the PPP funds for personal expenses and purchases.  Once the loan proceeds were distributed, the loan recipients paid Starks a portion of the loan proceeds as a “fee” for obtaining the loan.

American Express Agrees to Pay $108.7M to Settle Allegations of Deceptive Marketing and “Dummy” Account Information,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/american-express-agrees-pay-1087m-settle-allegations-deceptive,"January 16, 2025",2025,"The American Express Company (American Express), based in New York, New York, has agreed to pay a $108.7 million civil penalty to resolve allegations that it violated the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA) by deceptively marketing credit card and wire transfer products and by entering “dummy” Employer Identification Numbers in the credit card accounts of its affiliate bank.
“When financial companies engage in deceptive sales tactics or falsify information to cover up a failure to follow applicable regulations, they threaten the integrity of our financial system,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton, head of the Justice Department’s Civil Division. “Today’s settlement makes clear that the department will hold accountable those who violate the trust placed in them to follow the rules governing our financial institutions and to be truthful about their business practices.”
The United States alleged that, from 2014 through 2017, American Express deceptively marketed credit cards through the conduct of an affiliated entity that initiated sales calls to small businesses. The alleged deceptive practices included misrepresenting the card rewards or fees and whether credit checks would be done without a customer’s consent and submitting falsified financial information for prospective customers, such as overstating a business’s income.
The United States also alleged that American Express engaged in practices to deceive its federally insured financial institution into allowing certain small business customers to acquire American Express credit cards without the required employer identification numbers (EINs). EINs are required by law if the card recipient is a business entity such as a corporation or partnership; the requirement does not apply to sole proprietors. The United States alleged that American Express employees used “dummy” EINs such as “123456788” in opening small business credit cards in 2015 and the first half of 2016. These cards were sold to replace an American Express co-branded credit card that was being discontinued during that time period. American Express allegedly allowed these “dummy” EINs to remain on the credit card accounts for up to two years before remediating the problem. American Express allegedly knew that many of the small business applicants had previously acquired American Express-issued co-brand cards where the card application stated that EINs were required for corporations or partnerships, but if the applicants left the EIN line blank, American Express would assume they are sole proprietors. That practice exacerbated the effects of American Express’s failure to enter proper EINs when it sold these customers replacement cards.
Finally, the United States further contended that American Express employees deceptively marketed wire transfer products known as Payroll Rewards and Premium Wire to its small business customers from 2018 through 2021, making false assertions regarding these products’ tax benefits. As to both products, American Express allegedly would wire money for an above-market fee that was far in excess of that offered by competitors in the marketplace and award the businesses or the business owners credit card membership reward points. American Express sales employees allegedly told customers that the wire transfer fees were tax deductible as business expenses, while the reward points earned on the transaction were not taxable, and thereby afforded the customer tax-free benefits.  The United States contended, however, that the above-market wiring fee was not deductible as an ordinary or necessary business expense insofar as it was incurred by a customer solely for the purpose of generating a personal benefit.
Contemporaneous with the civil resolution, American Express will enter into a Non-Prosecution Agreement with the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York and pay a criminal fine and forfeiture. That agreement deals exclusively with the Payroll Rewards and Premium Wire programs referenced above. Under the terms of the civil settlement, American Express will receive a credit toward the satisfaction of the civil penalty in the amount of $30.35 million if it makes a full payment of the forfeiture and fine amounts due under the criminal resolution.
“This multi-million-dollar settlement holds American Express accountable for violating FIRREA through unlawful sales tactics and recordkeeping requirements, and deceiving small business customers who placed their trust in the Company,” said Special Agent in Charge Jeffrey D. Pittano of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC-OIG), Mid-Atlantic Region. “The FDIC-OIG will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to investigate financial crimes that harm customers and undermine the integrity of our Nation’s financial institutions.”
“Today’s multi-million dollar settlement should make clear that financial companies who engage in fraudulent and deceptive practices will be held accountable for their actions,” said Special Agent in Charge John T.

Hampton Woman Pleads Guilty to $161 Million Mortgage Fraud Scheme,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/hampton-woman-pleads-guilty-161-million-mortgage-fraud-scheme,"January 10, 2025",2025,"ATLANTA - Kimberly Johnson has pleaded guilty for her role in a mortgage fraud scheme spanning more than three years and resulting in the approval of approximately 450 mortgage loans based on fabricated documents and false information. Many of the loans are insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), resulting in claims being paid for mortgages that have defaulted.
“The defendant and her co-conspirators brazenly manipulated the real estate lending process out of sheer greed,” said U.S. Attorney Ryan Buchanan. “Criminals like Johnson, who engage in mortgage fraud, threaten the soundness of the real estate market in our communities. Our office is committed to prosecuting these bad actors who abuse the system for their personal gain and to safeguard the mortgage lending system for those who rely on this financial support.”
“Kimberly Johnson engaged in a massive mortgage fraud scheme, fabricating material documents on over 450 loans to falsely qualify individuals for loans they would not have otherwise qualified for,” said Special Agent-in-Charge Jerome Winkle with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), Office of Inspector General (OIG).  “When individuals commit fraud against federally funded programs, it creates significant risks to the programs and limits the financial resources available to assist hard working individuals realize the American dream of homeownership. HUD OIG will continue to work with its prosecutorial and law enforcement partners to vigorously pursue those who seek to profit by abusing HUD-funded programs.”
“Ms. Johnson’s guilty plea is the result of our commitment to hold anyone who exploits the mortgage lending system for personal gain fully accountable,” said Edwin S. Bonano, Special Agent in Charge of FHFA-OIG’s Southeast Region. “This case highlights the importance of collaboration between our law enforcement partners to protect the integrity of the housing market and prevent fraud that undermines public trust.”
“The defendant in this case pleaded guilty for her role in altering and fabricating supporting documents in fraudulent mortgage loan applications, as part of a scheme that resulted in the approval of approximately 450 mortgage loans,” said Kyle A. Myles, Special Agent in Charge of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC OIG), Atlanta Region. “The FDIC OIG remains committed to working with our law enforcement colleagues to investigate those who commit fraudulent acts and threaten to undermine the safety and soundness of our nation’s financial system.”
“The FBI will vigorously investigate criminal offenses that impact the integrity of the residential mortgage market. In this case, Johnson had the duty to conduct business honestly but instead chose to engage in mortgage fraud, securing mortgages for individuals who otherwise would not have qualified for one,” said Sean Burke, Acting Special Agent in Charge of FBI Atlanta. “We are proud to have worked with our law enforcement partners and the U.S. Attorney’s Office in the effort to prosecute anyone who engages in this type of misconduct.”
According to U.S. Attorney Buchanan, the charges and other information presented in court: Kimberly Johnson participated in a conspiracy in which homebuyers and mortgage brokers submitted fraudulent loan applications to induce mortgage lenders to fund mortgages. Johnson’s role in the scheme was to alter or fabricate the supporting documents for the loans, including bank statements, pay stubs and Forms W-2. Over the course of more than three years, Johnson helped approximately 450 homebuyers to commit mortgage fraud by obtaining loans for which they were unqualified. The fraudulent loan applications were submitted to numerous mortgage lenders, and some of the mortgage brokers who worked on obtaining the loans were part of the conspiracy. These fraudulent loans totaled approximately $161 million. Many of those loans have already defaulted.
Kimberly Johnson, 55, of Hampton, Georgia, pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States in a mortgage fraud scheme and, as part of her plea, has agreed to pay restitution to the victims of the conspiracy, including the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, which insures many of the residential mortgages in the United States. Johnson is scheduled to be sentenced on April 11, 2025, before U.S. District Judge Sarah E. Geraghty.
This case is being investigated by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Office of Inspector General, the Federal Housing Finance Agency Office of Inspector General, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Alison Prout is prosecuting the case.

California Couple Sentenced for Defrauding Paycheck Protection Program,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/california-couple-sentenced-defrauding-paycheck-protection,"January 10, 2025",2025,"HONOLULU – On January 9, 2025, Senior United States District Judge J. Michael Seabright sentenced Christopher A. Mazzei, 46, and Erin V. Mazzei, 43, both of Arroyo Grande, California, to 36 months and 27 months of imprisonment, respectively, for conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering in connection with a scheme to defraud the government of forgivable Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan funds intended for Coronavirus-related relief. The Mazzeis pleaded guilty to two counts of an Indictment on August 28, 2024.
According to court documents and the statements of counsel at sentencing, Christopher and Erin Mazzei, who are husband and wife, submitted applications for PPP funds to Bank of Hawaii and two other banks on behalf of three purported businesses, each time utilizing interstate wires. For each application, the Mazzeis created false Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax returns and payroll records, which they presented as authentic and submitted to the banks to support their claims for PPP loan funds. The Mazzeis admitted that as a result of the false and fraudulent applications, they received $1,365,000 in PPP loan funds, which they then used for personal purposes, such as to purchase multiple sport utility vehicles and a home in Kapolei, Hawaii, among other things. In addition, the couple spent approximately $164,796 to film a promotional trailer for a television project entitled “Ohana,” that they hoped to produce in the State of Hawaii, and that they hoped would attract the attention of film producer and actor Dwayne Johnson.
The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act is a federal law enacted on March 29, 2020, which was designed to provide emergency financial assistance to the millions of Americans who were suffering the economic effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. One source of relief provided by the CARES Act was the authorization of up to $349 billion in forgivable loans to small businesses for job retention and certain other expenses, through the PPP. In April 2020, Congress authorized over $300 billion in additional PPP funding.
The PPP allowed qualifying small businesses and other organizations to receive loans with a maturity of two years and an interest rate of 1 percent. PPP loan proceeds had to be used by businesses on payroll costs, interest on mortgages, rent, and utilities. The PPP allowed the interest and principal on the PPP loan to be entirely forgiven if the business spent the loan proceeds on these expense items within a designated period of time after receiving the proceeds and used at least a certain percentage of the PPP loan proceeds on payroll expenses.
Referring to the PPP as “crisis-based legislation,” Judge Seabright called the fraud conduct here “particularly blatant and egregious.” In pronouncing his sentence to both defendants, Judge Seabright remarked, “greed drove both of you.”
“The Mazzeis perpetrated a gross fraud to obtain critical resources intended for members of our community experiencing devastating hardships as a result of the pandemic,” said United States Attorney Clare E. Connors. “The sentences appropriately condemn their conduct, and our office remains committed to bringing these prosecutions to ensure accountability for such bad acts and to protect the public fisc.”
“This scheme diverted emergency relief that could have paid 25 Americans an average salary,” said Adam Jobes, Special Agent in Charge of IRS Criminal Investigation’s Seattle Field Office. “While small businesses shut down all over the country, the Mazzeis lived in excess on the taxpayer’s dime.”
“Christopher and Erin Mazzei falsified loan applications to fraudulently obtain PPP loan proceeds earmarked to help struggling businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Mazzeis actions not only defrauded the PPP Loan Program, but also disadvantaged business owners who were entitled to the benefits,” said Special Agent in Charge Ryan L. Korner from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC OIG). “The FDIC OIG is committed to working alongside our law enforcement partners to protect the Nation’s financial system and hold accountable those individuals, like the Mazzeis, who steal benefits designated to help those in need.”
“Christopher and Erin Mazzei defrauded the federal government of pandemic relief funds for their own personal gain and have now been brought to justice for their actions,” said Jon Ellwanger, Special Agent in Charge, Western Region, Office of Inspector General for the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. “We are proud to have worked with our federal law enforcement partners and the U.S. Attorney’s Office to hold Mr. and Mrs. Mazzei accountable.”
The investigation was conducted jointly by IRS Criminal Investigation, the FDIC Office of Inspector General, and the Office of Inspector General for the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, with assistance from the Small Business Administration Office of Inspector General and the U.S. Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration. Assistant U.S. Attorney Gregg Paris Yates prosecuted the case.
On May 17, 2021, the Attorney General established the COVID-19 Fraud Enforcement Task Force to marshal the resources of the Department of Justice in partnership with agencies across government to enhance efforts to combat and prevent pandemic-related fraud. The Task Force bolsters efforts to investigate and prosecute the most culpable domestic and international criminal actors and assists agencies tasked with administering relief programs to prevent fraud by, among other methods, augmenting and incorporating existing coordination mechanisms, identifying resources and techniques to uncover fraudulent actors and their schemes, and sharing and harnessing information and insights gained from prior enforcement efforts.

Real Estate Developer Sentenced to Nearly 13 Years in Prison for Embezzling Millions From the Failed Washington Federal Bank in Chicago,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/real-estate-developer-sentenced-nearly-13-years-prison,"December 17, 2024",2024,"CHICAGO — A federal judge in Chicago has sentenced a real estate developer to nearly 13 years in prison for participating in a conspiracy that embezzled millions of dollars from the failed Washington Federal Bank for Savings in Chicago.
Washington Federal, which was based in Chicago’s Bridgeport neighborhood, was shut down in 2017 after the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency determined that the bank was insolvent and had at least $66 million in nonperforming loans. For more than a decade, developer MAREK MATCZUK was part of a conspiracy that embezzled millions of dollars in bank funds.  The embezzled funds were disguised as purported real estate development loan disbursements to Matczuk and others.  The conspirators were not required to repay these purported loans, and they never did.
A jury in federal court last year convicted Matczuk, 61, of Park Ridge, Ill., of conspiring to commit embezzlement and falsify bank records, and aiding and abetting embezzlement by bank employees.  On Monday, U.S. District Judge Virginia M. Kendall sentenced Matczuk to 12 years and eleven months in prison and ordered him to pay more than $5.9 million in restitution.
The sentence was announced by Morris Pasqual, Acting United States Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois; Vincent R. Zehme, Special Agent-in-Charge of the Chicago Region of the FDIC’s Office of Inspector General; Machelle L. Jindra, Special Agent-in-Charge of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's Office of Inspector General in Chicago; Ramsey E. Covington, Acting Special Agent-in-Charge of IRS Criminal Investigation Chicago Field Office; Korey Brinkman, Special Agent-in-Charge of the Central Region of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, Office of Inspector General; Douglas S. DePodesta, Special Agent-in-Charge of the Chicago Field Office of the FBI; Andrea Peacock, Special Agent-in-Charge of the Department of the Treasury, Office of Inspector General; Deborah Witzburg, City of Chicago Inspector General; and Kathryn B. Richards, Chicago Housing Authority Inspector General.  Valuable assistance was provided by the U.S. Trustee Program.  The government was represented by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Michelle Petersen, Kristin Pinkston, and Jeffrey Snell, and Special Assistant U.S. Attorney Brian Netols.
The federal investigation into the collapse of Washington Federal led to criminal charges against 16 defendants, including the bank’s Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer, and other high-ranking employees, for conspiring to embezzle at least $31 million in bank funds.   Matczuk and three others were convicted after jury trials, while ten defendants pleaded guilty and two entered into deferred prosecution agreements.
Much of the embezzled money was transferred to Chicago attorney ROBERT M. KOWALSKI and other individuals outside the bank without all of the required documentation and often without any documentation whatsoever. A jury convicted Robert Kowalski on bankruptcy fraud, bank embezzlement, and false statement charges.  Judge Kendall in August sentenced Robert Kowalski to 25 years in federal prison.  Robert Kowalski’s sister, JAN R. KOWALSKI, also an attorney, pleaded guilty and was sentenced to more than three years in prison for fraudulently enabling her brother to conceal more than $357,000 from creditors and the trustee in his bankruptcy case.
Three former members of Washington Federal’s Board of Directors pleaded guilty to conspiring to falsify bank records to deceive the OCC.  WILLIAM M. MAHON was sentenced to 18 months in prison; GEORGE F. KOZDEMBA was sentenced to a year in prison; and JANICE M. WESTON was sentenced to three months in prison.
Chicago attorney PATRICK D. THOMPSON was convicted by a jury in 2022 of making false statements to the FDIC regarding the amount of money he received from Washington Federal via a purported loan and other unsecured payments.  He was also convicted of filing tax returns in which he falsely deducted interest that he had not actually paid to Washington Federal.  Thompson was sentenced to four months in federal prison.

Fox Point Man Sentenced to 24 Months’ Imprisonment for Investment Fraud Scheme,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/fox-point-man-sentenced-24-months-imprisonment-investment-fraud,"December 17, 2024",2024,"Gregory J. Haanstad, United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Wisconsin, announced that on December 16, 2024, David Braeger (age 57), of Fox Point, Wisconsin, was sentenced to 24 months’ incarceration for committing an investment fraud scheme that resulted in a loss of over $2,500,000 to investors.
According to court records, David Braeger was previously barred by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) from serving as a broker or otherwise associating with a broker-dealer firm. In 2017, Braeger incorporated an entity known as Blue Star Automotive Fund (“Blue Star”), in which he sold limited partnership shares to twenty-seven investors who gave him over $5.4 million for those shares. Braeger represented to those investors that those funds would primarily be used to fund an automobile dealership. Although Braeger provided approximately half of the money to the dealership, he misappropriated more than $2.5 million of investor funds in ways contrary to his representations. He spent his victims’ money on his own living expenses, including, but not limited to the purchase of several luxury vehicles and personal legal fees. Braeger also used his victims’ money to purchase the Silver Spring House Restaurant in Glendale, sponsor a NASCAR driver, and buy cryptocurrency. In addition to the Blue Star Scheme, Braeger also stole $100,000 from an investor as part of a venture he called IEF, which Braeger claimed would be used to fund litigation related to a Ugandan Energy company. Instead, Braeger misappropriated most of that money for his own personal use.
At the sentencing hearing, U.S. District Judge Lynn Adelman focused on the pain and suffering Braeger caused to his victims and noted that Braeger’s crime called for a significant period of incarceration because Braeger was motivated by “greed and self-aggrandizement.”  In addition to the 24-month period of incarceration, Braeger was ordered to pay restitution to his victims in the amount of $2,535,103.19.
“Mr. Braeger, who held no other job and earned no other income during the relevant period, used his background and connections to steal millions of dollars from over two dozen victims,” said U.S. Attorney Haanstad. “Braeger also added insult to the extensive financial injuries he caused, seeking to intimidate or bully some victims even after his scheme began unraveling. I commend all involved in seeking to hold Mr. Braeger accountable for his actions and for pursuing justice for his victims.”
“Mr. Braeger was brought to justice for engaging in a fraudulent scheme that duped investors and caused them losses of over $2.5 million, while he selfishly used the fraudulently obtained money to fund his own personal living expenses,” said Special Agent in Charge Vincent R. Zehme, of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General Chicago Region. “The FDIC OIG will continue to work closely with our law enforcement partners to investigate and hold accountable those who orchestrate such schemes that harm consumers and undermine the integrity of our Nation’s financial system.”
The case was referred to the U.S. Attorney’s Office by the Wisconsin Department of Financial Institutions. It was investigated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of the Inspector General and prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Julie F. Stewart.

According to court documents, Leonardo Ayala, 24, worked at a TD Bank store in Doral, Florida, between February and November 2023. Starting in June 2023, Ayala allegedly exploited his position as a bank employee to facilitate money laundering. As alleged, after another TD Bank employee opened accounts in the names of shell companies with nominee owners, Ayala assisted the money laundering network by issuing dozens of debit cards for the accounts in exchange for bribes. Those accounts were then allegedly used to launder millions of dollars in narcotics proceeds through cash withdrawals at ATMs in Colombia.
Ayala made his initial appearance yesterday in Miami federal court, and all future court proceedings will be in New Jersey. He is charged with one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. If convicted, he faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison.

California Man Sentenced to 15 Years and 8 Months in Prison for Defrauding Central Illinois Investors,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/california-man-sentenced-15-years-and-8-months-prison-defrauding,"November 27, 2024",2024,"URBANA, Ill. – Brett Michael Bartlett, 37, of Fountain Valley, California, was sentenced on November 25, 2024, to 188 months in prison for wire fraud, mail fraud, securities fraud, and money laundering. Bartlett was also ordered to serve a three-year term of supervised release following his imprisonment and to pay $22,502,092.66 in restitution to his victims.
During his previous plea of guilty, Bartlett admitted that, using his California-based companies, Dynasty Toys, and 7M E-group, he devised a scheme to defraud investors and obtain their money by making materially false and fraudulent pretenses, representations, and promises. Bartlett, through Dynasty Toys and 7M E-group, purchased items at liquidation sales and resold those items online, especially through Amazon. Bartlett solicited and accepted money from Central Illinois investors, first to purchase inventory to be resold by 7M E-group at promised annual returns of 20% to 40% and later to purchase Dynasty Toys’ preferred stock shares, which Bartlett claimed were expected to double in value.
Bartlett admitted that he induced investors to invest by dramatically overstating the success of the companies and the returns that the companies generated for investors, lying about the companies’ assets, failing to disclose the companies’ struggles even while continuing to solicit investments, and using investors’ funds for Bartlett’s own benefit. For example, Bartlett falsely told investors their existing shares were worth approximately $30 million in total, that Dynasty Toys owned hundreds of millions of dollars of gold assets, and that another company was going to purchase Dynasty Toys for $120 million. As a result, over 1,000 individuals, including over 50 investors from Central Illinois, invested over $22.5 million with Bartlett, 7M E-group, and Dynasty Toys.
Bartlett further admitted that in May 2020, he mailed to Central Illinois investors checks totaling millions of dollars, but the checks bounced. Nonetheless, after that, Bartlett transferred hundreds of thousands of dollars to his personal bank account and took his family members and employees to a luxury business retreat at Big Bear Lake in California. The Court found that investors lost approximately $22.5 million as a result of Bartlett’s fraud.
At the sentencing hearing, the prosecution presented evidence that numerous victims experienced substantial financial hardship as a result of Bartlett’s fraud scheme, in some cases losing their entire retirement savings. Many of the victims were devastated not only by the financial loss, but also the sense of betrayal because they had trusted Bartlett, who had repeatedly told the investors that they were his “family” and that he shared their faith in God.
The prosecution told the sentencing judge that many of the victims felt guilty because they had encouraged other family members, friends, and church associates to invest with Bartlett based on his false representations.
Also at the hearing, U.S. District Judge Colin S. Bruce found that a sentencing enhancement was appropriate because Bartlett’s scheme involved sophisticated means, including offering to convert investor’s shares to “gold contracts” that turned out to be worthless. Judge Bruce also ordered the criminal forfeiture of a property held in Tennessee in the name of one of Bartlett’s corporations.
Bartlett faced a penalty of up to twenty years in prison on each fraud charge and a penalty of up to ten years in prison on the money laundering charge. Bartlett also faced a penalty of up to three years of supervised release on each charge. Although the charges also carried maximum fines of up to $6.25 million, the prosecution did not request a fine so that any money recovered from Bartlett would to go to restitution for his victims.
“The defendant’s reprehensible conduct had life-changing and devastating repercussions for his victims in Central Illinois and across the country,” said U.S. Attorney Gregory K. Harris. “Our office is dedicated to pursuing those who deal in fraudulent investments. We are grateful to our federal law enforcement partners’ critical work in accomplishing that mission.”
“Brett Bartlett’s greed left a trail of victims in the path of his fraudulent schemes,” said FBI Springfield Special Agent in Charge Christopher Johnson.” And while the victims lives and financial futures were sadly changed forever, this significant sentence brings justice and underscores the investigative efforts of FBI Springfield and the FDIC–Office of Inspector General.”
“It is fitting that Mr. Bartlett was brought to justice for having engaged in a massive fraud that brought financial ruin to more than 1,000 unsuspecting and trusting investors,” said Special Agent in Charge Vincent R. Zehme, of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC OIG), Chicago Region.  “His prison sentence and the restitution ordered is just punishment for luring investors with false representations and promises; betraying their trust; and selfishly using more than $22 million of their hard-earned funds for his personal benefit and to support his scheme.  Adding insult to injury—he mailed some of them millions of dollars in checks that bounced. The FDIC OIG will continue to work tirelessly with our law enforcement partners to bring a halt to such schemes that harm innocent consumers and undermine the integrity of our Nation’s banks.”
The charges are the result of an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Springfield Field Office, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation – Office of Inspector General. Supervisory Assistant U.S. Attorney Eugene L. Miller represented the government in the prosecution.

Victims of cryptocurrency scam awarded restitution,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/victims-cryptocurrency-scam-awarded-restitution,"November 4, 2024",2024,"WICHITA, KAN. – After a $47.1 million cryptocurrency scheme caused a Kansas bank to fail, a federal judge ordered during a restitution hearing that millions of dollars seized by the government be divided among investors who suffered financial losses.
In August 2024, Shan Hanes, 53, of Elkhart was sentenced to 293 months in prison after pleading guilty to one count of embezzlement by a bank officer.
While the chief executive officer (CEO) of Heartland Tri-State Bank (HTSB), Hanes initiated outgoing wire transfers of bank funds to a cryptocurrency wallet belonging to third parties. This caused Heartland to collapse, and the bank investors to lose approximately $9 million.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) was able to recover $8 million in funds associated with the fraud.
“The U.S. Attorney’s Office – District of Kansas thanks the FBI for its diligent investigations that led to the discovery and recovery of over $8 million in stolen funds. Through Hanes’ conviction and prison sentence, the Department of Justice obtained justice for the victims, and now with this court order, those victims will receive some financial relief,” said U.S. Attorney Kate E. Brubacher.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation – Office of Inspector General (FDIC-OIG), Federal Reserve Board - Office of Inspector General (FRB-OIG), and Federal Housing Finance Agency – Office of Inspector General ((FHFA-OIG) investigated the case.

"Mortgage Broker Admits to Running a Ponzi Scheme, Fraudulently Acquiring CARES Act Loans, Filing a False Tax Return",https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/mortgage-broker-admits-running-ponzi-scheme-fraudulently,"October 31, 2024",2024,"PROVIDENCE, RI – United States Attorney Zachry A. Cunha announced today that a Rhode Island mortgage broker who purported to match borrowers seeking short-term loans with private lenders seeking high rates of return admitted to a federal judge that he misappropriated more than $1.5 million dollars of investors’ funds by using the money to repay earlier investors, support his own international investment opportunities, and to cover personal expenses.
Additionally, Joseph Giuttari, owner and operator of Hybrid Capital Group, LLC; THE FENS CO., LLC; and Realty Funding Advisors, LLC, among others, admitted that he filed fraudulent applications seeking COVID-19 pandemic Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL) for two of his companies, and that he failed to accurately report on his personal 2019 IRS tax return a total income of more than $540,000.
Giuttari pleaded guilty today to charges of wire fraud, theft of government property, and filing a false tax return.
Charging documents reflect that Giuttari falsely misrepresented his investment experience and success in an effort to persuade investors. As part of his scheme, Giuttari allegedly misrepresented to investors the amount a borrower was interested in obtaining; misrepresented that documents were in place to secure the investment funds; inflated how much borrowers owed; used borrowers’ names without their authorization to obtain funds from investors; and created fraudulent promissory notes and real estate documents bearing forged signatures of borrowers.
Giuttari admitted that he lulled investors with false and fraudulent excuses and promises, and that he placated and appeased certain earlier investors and lenders by paying them back using new investor monies he obtained. Court documents reflect that at sentencing the government will show that the amount of loss attributable to the defendant is between $3,500,000 and $9,500,000.
Additionally, Giuttari admitted to the court that he fraudulently applied for and acquired over $160,000 in pandemic EIDL loans for Hybrid Capital Group and THE FENS CO that he was not entitled to receive. He did so by falsely stating on EIDL applications that his companies were not engaged in lending or investments.
Giuttari further admitted that he falsely stated on his 2019 U.S. Individual Income Tax Return that his total income was $22,176, when in fact it was at least $541,000.
Giuttari is scheduled to be sentenced on January 30, 2025. The defendant’s sentence will be determined by a federal district judge after consideration of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.
The case is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Sandra R. Hebert.
The matter was investigated by the FBI and Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation.

Orange County Supervisor Agrees to Plead Guilty to Bribery Conspiracy Involving $10 Million in COVID Relief Funds,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/orange-county-supervisor-agrees-plead-guilty-bribery-conspiracy,"October 22, 2024",2024,"OC Supervisor Andrew Do Admits Receiving More Than $550,000 in Bribe Payments from Funds Meant to Be Used to Provide Meals to Elderly
SANTA ANA, California – The District One Supervisor on the Orange County Board of Supervisors has agreed to plead guilty to a felony federal charge for accepting more than $550,000 in bribes for directing and voting in favor of more than $10 million in COVID funds to a charity affiliated with one of his daughters, Rhiannon Do, the Justice Department announced today.
Andrew Hoang Do, 62, agreed to plead guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit bribery concerning programs receiving federal funds. His plea agreement and information were filed today. He is expected to make his initial appearance in United States District Court in Santa Ana later this month.
Do is one of five supervisors on the Orange County Board of Supervisors, which is responsible for the county’s $9 billion annual budget. As a county supervisor, Do represents the cities of Cypress, Fountain Valley, Garden Grove, Huntington Beach, La Palma, Los Alamitos, Midway City, Rossmoor, Seal Beach, and Westminster. He has served as a county supervisor since February 2015.
As part of his plea agreement, Do admitted that in exchange for more than $550,000 in bribes, beginning in 2020, he voted in favor of and directed millions of dollars in COVID-related funds to Viet America Society (VAS), a charity affiliated with his daughter. Do directed and worked together with other county employees to approve contracts with – and payments to – VAS. Do further admitted he acted corruptly and abused his position of trust as a county supervisor.
“By putting his own interests over those of his constituents, the defendant sold his high office and betrayed the public’s trust,” said United States Attorney Martin Estrada.  “Even worse, the money he misappropriated and accepted as bribe payments was taken from those most in need – older adults and disabled residents. Our community deserved much better. Corruption has no place in our politics and my office will continue to hold accountable officials who cheat the public.”
“While millions of Americans were dying from COVID-19, Orange County Supervisor Andrew Do was the fox in the hen house personified, raiding millions in federal pandemic relief funds and orchestrating the money intended to feed elderly and ailing residents to instead fill the pockets of insiders, himself and his loved ones all while portraying a public persona of a hometown hero guiding his constituents through the uncertainty and fear of a global pandemic,” said Orange County District Attorney Todd Spitzer. “No one is above the law in Orange County and these charges should serve as a powerful warning to elected officials everywhere that actions have consequences and justice will be swift and it will be decisive.”
“Elected officials have a responsibility to implement programs and policy that will benefit all the people they serve.  Their role is not to squander money, solicit bribes, or to steer funds to organizations or persons, wherein a coordinated effort allows those funds to make their way to family members or friends,” said Akil Davis, the Assistant Director in Charge of the FBI’s Los Angeles Field Office. “Today's plea is another exclamation point to the FBI's commitment to ensuring that all local, state, or federal elected and appointed public officials perform their duties with honesty, integrity, and commitment to all the constituents they serve.”
Shortly after receiving the COVID-related public funds from the county government – funds that were intended to provide meals to the elderly – VAS from April 2021 to February 2024 paid a business identified in court documents as “Company #1” $100,000 or more per month, which totaled approximately $3,804,000. In September 2021, VAS increased its payments to Company #1 from $100,000 to $108,000 per month. Company #1 then began paying Rhiannon Do – Do’s daughter – $8,000 per month, totaling by February 2024 approximately $224,000.
In his plea agreement, Do admitted that in addition to the $8,000 monthly payments that Company #1 had made to Do’s daughter, in July 2023, Company #1 also transferred a total of $381,500 from the funds it had received from VAS to an escrow company. In July 2023, Do’s daughter used the escrow account funds to purchase a home, in her name, in Tustin for $1,035,000. As part of that transaction, a mortgage for more than $600,000 was obtained by a loan application that contained false information and with fabricated documents. In her related diversion agreement attached as an exhibit to Do’s plea agreement, Do’s daughter admitted her conduct was criminal and violated federal and state law.
Do also admitted that the $381,500 from Company #1 that his daughter had used to purchase the Tustin house in 2023 was a disguised bribe to him. He also admitted that an additional $100,000 in payments sent to his other daughter, including three $25,000 checks from Company #2 – an air conditioning company that had been paid by VAS – also were bribes to him.
Some of the bribe funds that had been funneled to his daughters were spent for his direct benefit. For example, during 2022, a total of $14,849 of funds that had been funneled to Do’s daughters was used to make property tax payments for properties in Orange County owned by Do and his wife. Approximately $15,000 was used to pay for one of Do’s credit card bills.
Do knew that VAS was not providing all the meals for which the county had paid VAS. Instead, much of the funds were used for the benefit of insiders, including to buy real estate in the name of both Do’s daughter and Company #1, bribe payments to both of Do’s daughters, payments to other conspirators, payments to other companies affiliated with VAS’s listed officers, and through hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash withdrawals.
“Mr. Do had a duty to act in the best interest of the citizens of Orange County. He neglected that duty and misused the financial system to enrich himself,” said Special Agent in Charge Ryan Korner with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Office of Inspector General. “Public corruption degrades the public’s confidence in our political system, and FDIC OIG is proud to work alongside our law enforcement partners to identify and hold accountable individuals who abuse public service for private gain.”
“Andrew Do was entrusted to ensure taxpayer dollars were used responsibly and for the purposes intended,” said Special Agent in Charge Tyler Hatcher, IRS Criminal Investigation, Los Angeles Field Office. “Instead, when his constituents depended on COVID relief programs, Mr. Do exploited his position on the Orange County Board of Supervisors not only to influence channeling of funds to the Viet America Society, but also to accept bribes that were used to purchase a home, pay property taxes, and even to pay fictitious incomes to family members. Combating public corruption is one of the most important roles federal law enforcement agencies play in our local communities, and we are proud to be a partner during this investigation.”
“Today’s actions shows that this elected official used his position of trust for personal gain. He didn’t think he would get caught. He was wrong,” said Adam Shanedling, Special Agent in Charge of the U.S. Department of Education Office of Inspector General’s Western Regional Office. “The OIG is proud to have been a part of the task force that investigated this matter and we’ll continue to work with our law enforcement partners to help safeguard the integrity of federal funds.”
The plea agreement requires Do to forfeit any assets connected to the bribery scheme, including the Tustin property his daughter purchased in 2023. As part of his daughter’s related diversion agreement, she also agreed to forfeit the Tustin property. The plea agreement requires Do to pay full restitution by paying back the bribe money he and his daughters received, which he has agreed to pay in full before he is sentenced. In August 2024, the government seized more than $2.4 million from VAS’s and Company #1’s bank accounts.
In a related agreement with the Orange County District Attorney’s Office (OCDA), attached as an exhibit to Do’s plea agreement, Do has agreed to immediately resign from the Orange County Board of Supervisors and to forfeit any pension credit for the time where he participated in the bribery conspiracy.
Once Do enters his guilty plea, he will face a statutory maximum sentence of five years in federal prison.
The FBI; the Orange County District Attorney’s Office Bureau of Investigation; the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Office of the Inspector General; IRS Criminal Investigation; and the United States Department of Education Office of the Inspector General investigated this matter.
This matter is being jointly prosecuted by the United States Attorney’s Office and OCDA. The prosecution is being led by Assistant United States Attorneys Charles E. Pell, Bradley E. Marrett, and Tara Vavere of the United States Attorney’s Office and Senior Deputy District Attorney Avery T. Harrison and Deputy District Attorneys Anthony J. Schlehner and L.J. Berger of the OCDA.

Bank Manager Sentenced to 65 Months in Prison for Coordinating Multistate COVID-19 Relief Program Fraud Scheme,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/bank-manager-sentenced-65-months-prison-coordinating-multistate,"October 21, 2024",2024,"CAMDEN, N.J. – A former branch manager of a national financial institution was sentenced to 65 months in prison for using his position to organize a conspiracy to help individuals obtain at least 38 fraudulent Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans totaling approximately $5 million, U.S. Attorney Philip R. Sellinger announced today.
Tommy Hawkins, 61, of Philadelphia, previously pleaded guilty before U.S. District Judge Karen M. Williams to one count of bank fraud conspiracy. Judge Williams imposed the sentence on Oct. 18, 2024, in Camden federal court. A codefendant, Sieff Robert Sargeant, 44, of Island Park, New York, previously pleaded guilty before Judge Williams to one count of money laundering and was sentenced on Oct. 2, 2024, to six months in prison and six months of home confinement.
According to documents filed in these cases and statements made in court:
The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act is a federal law enacted in March 2020 and was designed to provide emergency financial assistance to the millions of Americans who are suffering the economic effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. One source of relief provided by the CARES Act was the authorization of hundreds of billions of dollars in forgivable loans to small businesses for job retention and certain other expenses, through a program referred to as the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). To obtain a PPP loan, a qualifying small business was required to apply and provide information on its operations, including the number of employees and expenses. In addition, businesses generally had to provide supporting documentation.
In 2020 and early 2021, Hawkins worked as the branch manager of the Conshohocken, Pennsylvania, branch of a national bank that was accepting Paycheck Protection Program (PPP)  loan applications. Hawkins worked with Eric Rivera, Lisa Smith, and others to recruit individuals who owned companies with little or no operations to open bank accounts at Hawkins’ branch and apply for PPP loans. Hawkins helped the recruited individuals submit PPP loan applications that contained materially false representations about the companies’ number of employees and payroll expenses. The applications also included false documentation, including tax forms. Based on these applications, Hawkins’ bank approved at least 38 PPP loans and disbursed approximately $5 million. Hawkins received incentive compensation through the bank for opening business bank accounts for the companies that received fraudulent PPP loans and also had an agreement with Rivera and Smith for them to pay Hawkins $5,000 of the loan proceeds for each PPP loan that Hawkins helped to obtain.
In April 2021, Sargeant’s business received a PPP loan based on a fraudulent application that was submitted through Hawkins’ branch. Sargeant then paid another individual, James Wessels, to create fake payroll checks. Sargeant distributed fake payroll checks to a friend, who cashed the checks and returned the majority of the cash to Sargeant. This was done to conceal that the proceeds actually were being spent on non-payroll expenses.
In addition the prison term, Judge Williams sentenced Hawkins to three years of supervised release and ordered restitution of $5.3 million.
Lisa Smith has pleaded guilty to her role in the scheme. Charges remain pending against Rivera and Wessels, and they are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.

Lancaster man sentenced for COVID relief fraud,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/lancaster-man-sentenced-covid-relief-fraud,"October 18, 2024",2024,"BUFFALO, NY – U.S. Attorney Trini E. Ross announced today that Larry Jordan, 45, of Lancaster, NY, who was convicted of conspiracy to commit bank fraud and wire fraud for his participation in a scheme to file fraudulent loan applications seeking forgivable Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans, was sentenced to serve 18 months in prison by U.S. District Judge John L. Sinatra, Jr. Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri, head of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, joined the announcement.
According to court documents, between April and September 2020, Jordan and his brother Sutukh El a/k/a Curtis Jordan a/k/a Hugo Hurt a/k/a Hugo Hermes Hurtington, conspired to submit eight fraudulent PPP loan applications on behalf of companies they owned or controlled. Three of the applications were submitted to Evolve Bank & Trust and the other five were submitted to Lendio, a financial technology company based in Utah. The applications contained false statements about the 2019 payroll expenses of each company, which were used to calculate the amount of PPP funds to which the applicant-companies would be entitled. To corroborate the applications, Jordan and El submitted IRS forms, which had never been filed with the IRS, as well as fraudulent payroll registers that purported to identify the names, personal information, and salary of the employees identified on the PPP applications.
For example, a PPP loan application was submitted on behalf of 5 Stems Inc to Evolve. The application represented that in 2019, 5 Stems Inc had 194 employees and an average monthly payroll of $242,133.33. In truth, 5 Stems Inc had nine employees in 2019 and paid those employees a total of approximately $57,380 for all of 2019. Evolve approved the application and funded a $605,200 loan. The money was deposited into an account controlled by defendant El. Some of the money was used for the defendants’ own investments, as well as personal expenses and home improvements.
Sutukh El was previously convicted and is awaiting sentencing.
This case was investigated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s Office of Inspector General, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection’s Office of the Inspector General, the Federal Housing Finance Agency’s Office of the Inspector General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Small Business Administration’s Office of Inspector General.

"New Jersey Owner of Check Casher and Money Service Business Admits Filing More Than $325 Million in False Currency Transaction Reports, Operating and Aiding and Abetting an Unlicensed Money Transmitting Business",https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/new-jersey-owner-check-casher-and-money-service-business-admits,"October 16, 2024",2024,"CAMDEN, N.J. – The New Jersey owner of Galaxia International Inc., a check casher and money service business, admitted filing more than $325 million in false currency transaction reports and operating and aiding and abetting an unlicensed money transmitting business, U.S. Attorney Philip R. Sellinger announced today.
Ali Hassanein, 68, of Kearny, New Jersey, pleaded guilty before Chief U.S. District Judge Renée Marie Bumb in Camden federal court on Oct. 15, 2024, to an information charging him with conspiracy to cause a financial institution to file false currency transaction reports and operating and aiding and abetting the operation of an unlicensed money transmitting business.
“The Bank Secrecy Act imposes important requirements on financial institutions, including by requiring them and their executives to file accurate reports with the government concerning certain currency transactions. These requirements play a vital role in helping law enforcement prevent, detect, and stop illicit activity.  Ali Hassanein admitted that he and Galaxia flouted these requirements, which undermined the financial system and made Galaxia an easy target for bad actors. My office will continue to work to ensure that financial institutions who shirk their obligations and facilitate illicit activity are held accountable.”
U.S. Attorney Philip R. Sellinger
According to documents filed in this case and statements made in court:
From 2019 through February 2023, Hassanein owned and operated Galaxia International Services Inc. (Galaxia), a check casher and money service business that operated in New Jersey and other states. Under the Bank Secrecy Act and related regulations, Galaxia was required to file currency transaction reports (CTRs) for transactions involving more than $10,000 in currency. CTRs are required to list, among other things, the location of the transactions and the names of the people and entities physically conducting the transactions. Hassanein conducted more than $325 million in reportable check cashing transactions for a conspirator in exchange for a fee. But Hassanein caused Galaxia to file thousands of CTRs for those transactions that contained material misstatements and omissions. For example, the CTRs falsely stated that all of the transactions had occurred at Galaxia’s East Orange, New Jersey, location – where Galaxia had a license to conduct check cashing transactions – when in fact they had occurred in Jersey City, New Jersey, or Kearny, New Jersey, where Galaxia was not licensed to conduct check cashing transactions.  All of the CTRs failed to list the conspirator as the conductor of the transactions. Hassanein also aided and abetted the conspirator’s operation of an unlicensed money transmitting business
The charges of conspiring to cause a financial institution to file false currency transaction reports and operating and aiding and abetting the operation of an unlicensed money transmitting business each carry a statutory maximum prison sentence of five years and a statutory maximum fine of the greatest of $250,000, twice the gross amount of any pecuniary gain that any persons derived from the offense, or twice the gross amount of any pecuniary loss sustained by any victims of the offense, whichever is greatest. Sentencing is scheduled for April 2, 2025.
U.S. Attorney Sellinger credited special agents and task force officers of the Internal Revenue Service – Criminal Investigation, under the direction of Acting Special Agent in Charge Jenifer L. Piovesan in Newark; special agents and task force officers with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Frank A.

Iowa Farmer Sentenced to More Than Fifteen Years in Cattle Theft and Bankruptcy Fraud Scheme,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/iowa-farmer-sentenced-more-fifteen-years-cattle-theft-and,"October 11, 2024",2024,"Ordered to Pay Over $5.7 Million in Restitution to Victims of Cattle Theft, Pandemic Benefits Fraud, and Forced and Foreign Labor Fraud
A Clayton County farmer who stole over $5 million in livestock and COVID-19 pandemic benefits was sentenced on October 10, 2024, to more than 15 years in federal prison.  Michael Wayne Butikofer, age 54, from Monona, Iowa, received the prison term after a December 1, 2023, guilty plea to one count of theft of livestock, one count of wire fraud, and one count of false bankruptcy declaration.
Evidence in the case established that Butikofer operated a large farming operation in northeast Iowa known as “Fawn Hollow.”  Butikofer operated a so-called “custom cattle” feeding operation in which employees of his organization would raise and care for cattle owned by other individuals, including cattle investors located across the United States.  Fawn Hollow then sold the cattle, primarily to a Wisconsin slaughterhouse.
At no time was Butikofer or “Fawn Hollow” registered with the United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) as a “dealer” under the Packers and Stockyards Act of 1921 (“the Act”).  Butikofer participated in the “H-2A” visa program and recruited agricultural workers from the Republic of South Africa to work at Fawn Hollow.
Between July 2020 and February 2022, Butikofer converted the proceeds of sales of cattle owned by eight cattle investors, totaling over $2.5 million, to his own use.  Butikofer had convinced the cattle investors to allow Butikofer to sell the cattle in his own name.  When Butikofer sold the cattle to the Wisconsin slaughterhouse, Butikofer falsely represented to the slaughterhouse that he had “good and merchantable title to” the cattle when he did not, in fact, own or otherwise have title to the cattle.  By convincing the cattle investors to permit Butikofer to sell their cattle in his own name, and by fraudulently concealing the true ownership of the cattle from the slaughterhouse, Butikofer attempted to evade the requirements of the Act and its regulations for registration, posting of a dealer bond, and prompt payment, which would have protected the cattle investors’ funds.
In July 2020 and August 2020, Butikofer defrauded the USDA of more than $1.2 million in emergency assistance funds designed to assist livestock producers during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Specifically, applications were submitted in the name of another individual and entitled “Coronavirus Food Assistance Program” (“CFAP”) payments.  A cattle producer qualified for CFAP payments on a per head basis based on the producer’s owned inventory of eligible beef cattle on a date selected by the producer between certain dates in calendar year 2020.  It was part of Butikofer’s wire fraud scheme that Butikofer falsely represented in CFAP applications that he and some of his associates owned cattle when, in truth, they did not own the cattle in question.
In February 2022, Butikofer received over $1.5 million from the Small Business Administration (“SBA”) as part of an application for an Economic Injury Disaster Loan (“EIDL”). Butikofer made false representations to the SBA about his financial condition and intended use for the SBA loan funds.  Butikofer used part of the SBA funds to file for bankruptcy later that same month.
During the bankruptcy case, Butikofer perjured himself five times and made a series of false and fraudulent statements about his financial condition in bankruptcy filings.  In March 2022, Butikofer submitted a false and fraudulent statement of financial affairs in his bankruptcy case.  There were more than 100 creditors in Butikofer’s bankruptcy case, and Butikofer used the bankruptcy case to intentionally delay and hinder their legitimate collection efforts.
In 2018, Butikofer used forced labor to financially benefit Fawn Hollow.  Butikofer dumped dead cattle near a house in which the H2-A workers lived on his farm.  The workers had no hot water or furniture, and their water was contaminated.  On one occasion, Butikofer assaulted one worker, grabbing the migrant worker by the shirt and pushing him towards a corn auger.  Butikofer also tied the hands of another South African H-2A worker with a cable tie to an electric jigsaw and threatened workers with hanging and an electric shock dog collar.  In 2020, three migrant workers obtained a $247,000 civil judgment against Butikofer in federal court for violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act and the Trafficking Victims Protective Reauthorization Act.  Butikofer later used his fraudulent bankruptcy proceeding to convince the workers to settle their judgment for $75,000.
From April 2023 to November 2023, while on federal pretrial release, Butikofer recruited and caused another person in the Fawn Hollow criminal organization to recruit H-2A workers to the United States under false and fraudulent pretenses, representations, and promises.  The false and fraudulent pretenses, representations, and promises included: (1) the housing conditions provided to the employees; (2) the location of the employees’ work; (3) the terms and timing of reimbursement for the employees’ work and expenses; and (4) payment for injuries sustained during the employment.  For example, Butikofer convinced an H2-A worker from South Africa to come to the United States and bring his wife and teenaged daughter with him.  When the family arrived, however, Butikofer moved the family to live in a camper without water, electricity, or heat.  Ultimately, agents from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security rescued the family and paid for their food and shelter at a hotel in Cedar Rapids.  Agents later rescued other workers bound for Fawn Hollow in April 2024.
While Butikofer’s criminal case was pending, he repeatedly contacted witnesses in violation of a court order.  Butikofer also attempted to convince grand jury and trial witnesses to make false statements and sign false documents in attempts to obstruct justice.
Butikofer was sentenced in Cedar Rapids by United States District Court Chief Judge C.J. Williams.  At the sentencing, Judge Williams observed that Butikofer was operating a “Ponzi” scheme with investor cattle.  Butikofer was sentenced to 188 months’ imprisonment.  Butikofer was ordered to make over $5.7 million in restitution, forfeit $500,000, and repay $5,000 in attorney fees.  Butikofer must also serve a three-year term of supervised release after the prison term.  There is no parole in the federal system.  As part of his plea agreement, Butikofer promised to pay the H-2A workers’ entire $247,000 judgment and also to voluntarily terminate and cease participation in foreign labor programs with respect to any program administered by the U.S. Department of Labor or U.S. Department of Homeland Security.  Butikofer is being held in the United States Marshal’s custody until he can be transported to a federal prison.
United States Attorney Timothy T. Duax stated, “Butikofer treated his victims and the rule of law with equal contempt, and fully deserves his fifteen-year sentence to federal prison.  This office will continue to aggressively prosecute people who defraud the government through the agricultural sector, the bankruptcy court, and by the mistreatment of foreign workers.”
“Michael Butikofer exploited the H-2A program in order to enrich himself at the expense of agricultural workers. Butikofer recruited H-2A workers from South Africa. Once the workers were in the United States, Butikofer used threats of force to compel them to work for him. This sentencing sends a clear message that those who abuse the H-2A program will be held accountable. We will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to aggressively pursue those who exploit foreign labor certification programs,” said Casey Howard, Special Agent-in-Charge, Central Region, U.S. Department of Labor, Office of Inspector General.
“This sentencing demonstrates the commitment to holding individuals accountable for defrauding government programs, especially those designed to provide critical relief during the pandemic,” said Brady Ipock, Special Agent in Charge of the SBA OIG’s Central Region. “Our office will continue to pursue justice for victims and ensure the integrity of SBA’s disaster relief programs. I want to thank the U.S. Attorney’s Office and our law enforcement partners for their collaboration and dedication to justice.”
“The defendant in this case was held accountable for a number of serious fraudulent activities,” said Justin Bundy, Special Agent in Charge, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC OIG).  “He converted more than $2.5 million through a cattle investment scam and used those funds to enrich himself, at the expense of unsuspecting victims. He also falsely represented his financial condition and the intended use for SBA loan funds and defrauded the USDA of more than $1.5 million in funds designed to assist livestock producers during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Also egregious was his use of forced labor to financially benefit his business and his mistreatment of migrant works that he employed.  The FDIC OIG remains committed to working with our law enforcement partners to investigate and bring to justice those who participate in fraudulent schemes and threaten to undermine the integrity of our Nation’s banking system and government programs intended to benefit the American people.”
On May 17, 2021, the Attorney General established the COVID-19 Fraud Enforcement Task Force to marshal the resources of the Department of Justice in partnership with agencies across government to enhance efforts to combat and prevent pandemic-related fraud.  The Task Force bolsters efforts to investigate and prosecute the most culpable domestic and international criminal actors and assists agencies tasked with administering relief programs to prevent fraud by, among other methods, augmenting and incorporating existing coordination mechanisms, identifying resources and techniques to uncover fraudulent actors and their schemes, and sharing and harnessing information and insights gained from prior enforcement efforts.  For more information on the Department’s response to the pandemic, please visit https://www.justice.gov/coronavirus .
Anyone with information about allegations of attempted fraud involving COVID-19 can report it by calling the Department of Justice’s National Center for Disaster Fraud (NCDF) Hotline at 866-720-5721 or via the NCDF Web Complaint Form at: https://www.justice.gov/disaster-fraud/ncdf-disaster-complaint-form .
The case was prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Timothy L. Vavricek and was investigated by the Small Business Administration, Office of Inspector General, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of Inspector General, the United States Department of Agriculture, Office of Inspector General, the United States Department of Labor, Office of Inspector General, and Homeland Security Investigations.

New York Man Sentenced to 54 Months’ Imprisonment for Investment Fraud Scheme,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/new-york-man-sentenced-54-months-imprisonment-investment-fraud,"October 11, 2024",2024,"Gregory J. Haanstad, United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Wisconsin, announced that on October 10, 2024, Charles Lawrence (age 50) of Northpoint, New York, was sentenced to 54 months’ incarceration for committing an investment fraud scheme that resulted in a loss of over $4,000,000 to investors across the country and abroad.
Court records established the following: Lawrence was an investment advisor who held Series 7, 55, and 63 securities licenses from 1996 to 2006. By 2020, Lawrence became associated with various entities using the name “Landes,” including Landes Trust, Landes & Compagnie Trust Prive, and Landes Prive LLC. Lawrence used these entities to solicit money from unsuspecting victims by selling them an opportunity to join a “trading program” that he claimed would net them significant returns. As part of the scheme, Lawrence lured individuals into soliciting investments on his behalf by promising, and paying, “finder’s fees.” He used these unsuspecting “finders” to make himself, and the trading program, appear legitimate. Once a finder located a potential investor, Lawrence sent written communications and contracts that promised that the victims’ initial investment would be segregated in a separate account and would not be at any risk. Lawrence also promised that profits of 50% or more were possible and likely.
After the victims agreed to invest with Lawrence, Lawrence directed them to wire money into a bank account that he controlled. Lawrence also provided his victims a web portal to a Landes bank account on which they could see their initial investment, and provided frequent false updates about how their investment was performing. The web portal, Lawrence’s promises, and his updates were all fraudulent. Lawrence never invested any of the nearly $5,000,000 he received from his victims. Instead, Lawrence spent the money to fund an extravagant lifestyle that included lavish vacations, trips on private jets, spending hundreds of thousands at luxury retailers, and purchasing a 10.8-carat diamond Cartier ring.
In announcing his sentence, United States District Judge Lynn Adelman focused on the sophisticated nature of the scheme, noting that Lawrence’s victims took false comfort in the website where they could see their funds. Judge Adelman noted that Lawrence’s “lies were brazen,” that this was “a scam from the very beginning,” and that Lawrence was motivated solely by greed.
In addition to the 54-month period of incarceration, Lawrence was ordered to pay restitution to his victims in the amount of $4,030,263.51, and to forfeit the 10-carat Cartier ring and a Range Rover he purchased using $91,000 of his victims’ money.
“This scheme had a devastating impact on the victims taken in by Lawrence’s false promises and the elaborate measures he took to convince them that their investments were safe and lucrative,” said U.S. Attorney Haanstad. “I commend the excellent work of all involved in bringing Mr. Lawrence to justice for his actions.”
“The defendant in this case was held accountable for fraudulently obtaining millions of dollars through an investment scam and using those stolen funds to enrich himself, at the expense of unsuspecting victims. The defendant’s lulling activity included the creation of a website purporting to be that of a bank,” Special Agent in Charge Vince Zehme of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC OIG) said. “The FDIC OIG remains committed to working with our law enforcement partners to investigate and bring to justice those who participate in fraudulent schemes and threaten to undermine the integrity of our Nation’s banking system.”
The case was referred to the U.S. Attorney’s Office by the Securities and Exchange Commission. It was investigated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of the Inspector General and prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys Julie F. Stewart and Farris Martini.

TD Bank Pleads Guilty to Bank Secrecy Act and Money Laundering Conspiracy Violations in $1.8B Resolution,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/td-bank-pleads-guilty-bank-secrecy-act-and-money-laundering,"October 10, 2024",2024,"WASHINGTON — TD Bank N.A. (TDBNA), the 10th largest bank in the United States, and its parent company TD Bank US Holding Company (TDBUSH) (together with TDBNA, TD Bank) pleaded guilty today and agreed to pay over $1.8 billion in penalties to resolve the Justice Department’s investigation into violations of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and money laundering.
TDBNA pleaded guilty to conspiring to fail to maintain an anti-money laundering (AML) program that complies with the BSA, fail to file accurate Currency Transaction Reports (CTRs), and launder money. TDBUSH pleaded guilty to causing TDBNA to fail to maintain an AML program that complies with the BSA and to fail to file accurate CTRs.
TD Bank’s guilty pleas are part of a coordinated resolution with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Board (FRB), as well as the Treasury Department’s Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN).
“By making its services convenient for criminals, TD Bank became one,” said Attorney General Merrick B. Garland. “Today, TD Bank also became the largest bank in U.S. history to plead guilty to Bank Secrecy Act program failures, and the first US bank in history to plead guilty to conspiracy to commit money laundering. TD Bank chose profits over compliance with the law — a decision that is now costing the bank billions of dollars in penalties. Let me be clear: our investigation continues, and no individual involved in TD Bank’s illegal conduct is off limits.”
“For years, TD Bank starved its compliance program of the resources needed to obey the law. Today’s historic guilty plea, including the largest penalty ever imposed under the Bank Secrecy Act, offers an unmistakable lesson: crime doesn’t pay — and neither does flouting compliance,” said Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco. “Every bank compliance official in America should be reviewing today’s charges as a case study of what not to do. And every bank CEO and board member should be doing the same. Because if the business case for compliance wasn’t clear before — it should be now.”
“For nearly a decade, TD Bank failed to update its anti-money laundering compliance program to address known risks. As bank employees acknowledged in internal communications, these failures made the bank an ‘easy target’ for the ‘bad guys.’ These failures also allowed corrupt bank employees to facilitate a criminal network’s laundering of tens of millions of dollars,” said Principal Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri, head of the Justice Department's Criminal Division. “U.S. financial institutions are the first line of defense against money laundering and illicit finance. When they participate in crime rather than prevent it, we will not hesitate to hold them accountable to the fullest extent of the law.”
“TD Bank prioritized growth and convenience over following its legal obligations,” said U.S. Attorney Philip R. Sellinger for the District of New Jersey. “As a result of staggering and pervasive failures in oversight, it willfully failed to monitor trillions of dollars of transactions – including those involving ACH transactions, checks, high-risk countries, and peer-to-peer transactions – which allowed hundreds of millions of dollars from money laundering networks to flow through the bank, including for international drug traffickers. The bank was aware of these risks and failed to take steps to protect against them, including for two networks prosecuted in New Jersey and elsewhere – one that dumped piles of cash on the bank’s counters and another that allegedly withdrew amounts from ATMs 40 to 50 times higher than the daily limit for personal accounts.”
According to court documents, between January 2014 and October 2023, TD Bank had long-term, pervasive, and systemic deficiencies in its U.S. AML policies, procedures, and controls but failed to take appropriate remedial action. Instead, senior executives at TD Bank enforced a budget mandate, referred to internally as a “flat cost paradigm,” requiring that TD Bank’s budget not increase year-over-year, despite its profits and risk profile increasing significantly over the same period. Although TD Bank maintained elements of an AML program that appeared adequate on paper, fundamental, widespread flaws in its AML program made TD Bank an “easy target” for perpetrators of financial crime.
Over the last decade, TD Bank’s federal regulators and TD Bank’s own internal audit group repeatedly identified concerns about its transaction monitoring program, a key element of an appropriate AML program necessary to properly detect and report suspicious activities. Nonetheless, from 2014 through 2022, TD Bank’s transaction monitoring program remained effectively static, and did not adapt to address known, glaring deficiencies; emerging money laundering risks; or TD Bank’s new products and services. For years, TD Bank failed to appropriately fund and staff its AML program, opting to postpone and cancel necessary AML projects prioritizing a “flat cost paradigm” and the “customer experience.”
Throughout this time, TD Bank intentionally did not automatically monitor all domestic automated clearinghouse (ACH) transactions, most check activity, and numerous other transaction types, resulting in 92% of total transaction volume going unmonitored from Jan. 1, 2018, to April 12, 2024. This amounted to approximately $18.3 trillion of transaction activity. TD Bank also added no new transaction monitoring scenarios and made no material changes to existing transaction monitoring scenarios from at least 2014 through late 2022; implemented new products and services, like Zelle, without ensuring appropriate transaction monitoring coverage; failed to meaningfully monitor transactions involving high-risk countries; instructed stores to stop filing internal unusual transaction reports on certain suspicious customers; and permitted more than $5 billion in transactional activity to occur in accounts even after the bank decided to close them.
TD Bank’s AML failures made it “convenient” for criminals, in the words of its employees. These failures enabled three money laundering networks to collectively transfer more than $670 million through TD Bank accounts between 2019 and 2023. Between January 2018 and February 2021, one money laundering network processed more than $470 million through the bank through large cash deposits into nominee accounts. The operators of this scheme provided employees gift cards worth more than $57,000 to ensure employees would continue to process their transactions. And even though the operators of this scheme were clearly depositing cash well over $10,000 in suspicious transactions, TD Bank employees did not identify the conductor of the transaction in required reports. In a second scheme between March 2021 and March 2023, a high-risk jewelry business moved nearly $120 million through shell accounts before TD Bank reported the activity. In a third scheme, money laundering networks deposited funds in the United States and quickly withdrew those funds using ATMs in Colombia. Five TD Bank employees conspired with this network and issued dozens of ATM cards for the money launderers, ultimately conspiring in the laundering of approximately $39 million. The Justice Department has charged over two dozen individuals across these schemes, including two bank insiders. TD Bank’s plea agreement requires continued cooperation in ongoing investigations of individuals.
As part of the plea agreement, TD Bank has agreed to forfeit $452,432,302.00 and pay a criminal fine of $1,434,513,478.40, for a total financial penalty of $1,886,945,780.40. TD Bank has also agreed to retain an independent compliance monitor for three years and to remediate and enhance its AML compliance program. TD Bank has separately reached agreements with the FRB, OCC, and FinCEN, and the Justice Department will credit $123.5 million of the forfeiture toward the FRB’s resolution.
The Justice Department reached its resolution with TD Bank based on a number of factors, including the nature, seriousness, and pervasiveness of the offenses, as a result of which TD Bank became the bank of choice for multiple money laundering organizations and criminal actors and processed hundreds of millions of dollars in money laundering transactions. Although TD Bank did not voluntarily disclose its wrongdoing, it received partial credit for its strong cooperation with the Department’s investigation and the ongoing remediation of its AML program. TD Bank did not receive full credit for its cooperation because it failed to timely escalate relevant AML concerns to the Department during the investigation. Accordingly, the total criminal penalty reflects a 20% reduction based on the bank’s partial cooperation and remediation.
IRS Criminal Investigation, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General, and Drug Enforcement Administration investigated the case. The Morristown Police Department, U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Puerto Rico, Homeland Security Investigations, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and New York City Police Department provided substantial assistance.
Trial Attorneys D. Zachary Adams and Chelsea R. Rooney of the Criminal Division’s Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section (MLARS) and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Mark J. Pesce and Angelica Sinopole for the District of New Jersey prosecuted the case.
MLARS’ Bank Integrity Unit investigates and prosecutes banks and other financial institutions, including their officers, managers, and employees, whose actions threaten the integrity of the individual institution or the wider financial system. Since its creation in 2010, the Bank Integrity Unit has prosecuted financial institutions for violations of the BSA, money laundering, sanctions, and other laws, imposing total penalties of over $25 billion.
This effort is part of an Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces (OCDETF) operation. OCDETF identifies, disrupts, and dismantles the highest-level criminal organizations that threaten the United States using a prosecutor-led, intelligence-driven, multi-agency approach.

"South Florida U.S. Attorney’s Office Charges an Attorney, Former SBA Employee, Tax Preparer, and others with COVID-19 Fraud Schemes",https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/south-florida-us-attorneys-office-charges-attorney-former-sba,"September 30, 2024",2024,"MIAMI – The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida remains a leader in COVID-19 pandemic relief prosecutions, holding a range of actors accountable for these crimes. Over this summer alone, the district has charged 17 individuals with COVID-19 relief fraud cases, with scheme amounts totaling over $21 million.
In 2021, the Attorney General established the COVID-19 Fraud Enforcement Task Force to enhance efforts to combat and prevent pandemic-related fraud. In 2022, the Southern District of Florida’s U.S. Attorney’s Office was selected to head one of three national COVID-19 Fraud Strike Force Teams. Together, with federal, state and local law enforcement partners, the U.S. Attorney’s Office targets fraudsters that took advantage of programs that offered assistance during the pandemic. Since the pandemic, more than 185 people have been charged in the Southern District of Florida for schemes involving more than around $220 million.
“These defendants have in common a willingness to exploit federal programs created to help people in a global pandemic for their own gain,” stated U.S. Attorney Markenzy Lapointe for the Southern District of Florida. “The U.S. Attorney’s Office and our law enforcement partners will continue to uncover COVID-19 related financial fraud schemes and hold people accountable – regardless of their role in the community. We will not allow limited federal tax dollars, which were intended to provide a lifeline to small businesses as they struggled to stay afloat during the economically devastating pandemic lockdown, to be stolen to support criminal actors.”
“The Department of Justice remains committed to the prosecution of those who engaged in COVID-19 benefits program fraud and the return of recovered funds to the American taxpayers. I appreciate the dedication of the prosecutors and investigators who brought these people to justice and worked to protect the integrity of our federal benefits programs,” said Mandy Riedel, Director of COVID-19 Fraud Enforcement.
The following cases were charged this summer.
Cases Against Federal Employees
A number of federal employees and former federal employees have been charged with COVID loan schemes, including:
U.S. v. Malaina Chapman, Case No. 24-CR-20321 : Chapman, 37, of Hialeah, Fla., a former SBA employee, was indicted in July 2024. The indictment alleges that, while employed by the SBA, Chapman became involved in multiple schemes to defraud the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) and Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) program, as well as to defraud local credit unions and local and state programs designed to assist those affected by the Covid-19 pandemic pay their rent. United States Postal Service Office of Inspector General (USPS OIG) and the U.S. Small Business Administration Office of Inspector General (SBA OIG) investigated this case.  This case is being handled by Assistant U.S. Attorney Daniel Bernstein.
“Fraudulent exploitation of SBA's pandemic relief programs diverts critical resources from the small businesses that truly need them,” said Amaleka McCall-Brathwaite, Special Agent in Charge of the SBA OIG’s Eastern Region. “Our office is committed to protecting taxpayer funds and ensuring that individuals who attempt to defraud SBA programs are brought to justice. I want to thank the U.S. Attorney’s office and our law enforcement partners for their collaboration and dedication to justice.”
Unemployment Insurance Fraud
A number of defendants in Florida were charged with defrauding the California Employment Development Department of millions of dollars by making false claims for unemployment with the personally identifiable information of the victims of identity theft. These cases were investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), U.S. Department of Labor Office of Inspector General (DOL OIG), SBA OIG, and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI).
This includes:
U.S. v. Harold Eubanks and Myotha Francois, Case No. 24-CR-20335: handled by Assistant U.S. Attorney Roger Cruz.
U.S. v. Kenneth Dikari Stevens, Jr. and Giovanni Kymani Paul Matthews, Case No. 24-CR-20293: handled by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Sean Cronin and Aimee Jimenez.
U.S. v. Zachary Ramyard, Case No. 24-CR-20382: handled by Assistant U.S. Attorney Joesph Egozi.
“These cases represent the continued commitment of the FBI and many other federal agencies to identify and hold accountable those who engaged in COVID relief fraud,” said Jeffrey B. Veltri, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI’s Miami Field Office. “The intent of these programs was to provide a financial safety net to eligible businesses during a time of economic duress – not as a way for criminals to fund their lifestyles. While the relief programs have ended, our pursuit of the fraudsters has not. The amount of fraud we’ve seen is staggering. We continue to work hard every day to investigate these fraud schemes and protect the public from being swindled.”
“This funding was intended to mitigate the risk to Americans and businesses impacted by an unprecedented global pandemic but was stolen by individuals for their own personal gain” said Anthony Salisbury Special Agent in Charge Homeland Security Investigations in Miami “Criminally taking advantage of  programs designed to help our communities will not be tolerated. HSI and their partners will vigilantly pursue all those who seek to exploit these programs to ensure that Americans properly in need of this kind of support have access.”
COVID-19 Procurement Fraud
This office continues to investigate and pursue individuals who capitalized on the pandemic by illegally profiting on personal protective equipment (PPE), including:
U.S. v. Nabil Nahlah, Case No. 24-CR-20434 : Nahlah, 49, of Miami Beach, Fla., was charged with one count of fraud against the United States, arising from his efforts to sell millions of dollars of PPE to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) during the COVID-19 pandemic. According to allegations contained in the charging documents filed Sept. 25, Nahlah, through his company The Noble Attorney, made bids on various procurement requests from the VA for items like medical masks and examination gloves. Nahlah won the contracts by making false and fraudulent representations to the VA, namely by claiming that his firm was an authorized distributor or reseller of the PPE manufacturers and that he had the qualifying PPE in stock and available for immediate delivery. Nahlah furthered the scheme to defraud the VA by creating a fake web domain and email address for a PPE manufacturer and using it to submit a phony authorized distributor letter to the VA. Once awarded the lucrative contracts, Nahlah shipped non-conforming PPE to the VA, including counterfeit medical masks. This case was investigated by the VA Office of Inspector General’s (VA OIG) and the FDA Office of Criminal Investigations.  This case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Jon Juenger.
U.S. v. Rodrigo Mera, Case No. 24-CR-20148 : In August 2024, Mera pled guilty to stealing gloves and other PPE from his employer during the pandemic. Mera admitted he sold the stolen PPE under false pretenses and profited over $1 million. This case was investigated by the United States Secret Service (USSS).  This case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Daniel Bernstein.
“The charges included in today’s announcement highlight the VA Office of Inspector General’s dedication throughout the pandemic to protect veterans and VA employees from those who would exploit the opportunity for fraudulent gain,” said Special Agent in Charge David Spilker with the VA OIG Southeast Field Office. “The VA OIG remains steadfast in our commitment to work with our law enforcement partners to ensure the integrity of VA’s vital supply chain.”
“The FDA continues to monitor the marketplace to ensure that medical devices are safe and effective for American consumers,” said Special Agent in Charge Justin Fielder, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations’ Miami Field Office. “Today’s announcement should serve as a reminder that the FDA is continuing to collaborate with our fellow law enforcement partners to bring to justice those who place profits above the public health.”
Cases Against COVID-19 Loan Preparers
A number of loan preparers have been charged, including:
U.S. v. Pete Andrew Cohen, Case No. 24-CR-60017: Cohen, 56 of Miramar, Fla., was the president of Taxez Taxez Taxez Incorporation in Miramar.   From June 2020 through June 2021, the defendant caused the filing of approximately $3 million in fraudulent PPP loan applications that falsely and fraudulently inflated the number of employees and payroll figures for the applicants. The defendant also arranged for PPP loan borrowers to create false and fraudulent payroll information using a payroll service. Cohen pled guilty and is scheduled to be sentenced on Oct. 17, before U.S. District Judge Rodney Smith. This case was investigated by Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI) and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC-OIG). This case is being prosecuted by Senior Litigation Counsel Michael N. Berger.
U.S. v. Marc Prince, Case No. 24-CR-20214 : Prince, 41 of Miramar, reached out to various small business owners, directly or indirectly, to offer to obtain PPP loans. From June 2020 through April 2021, Prince caused the filing of approximately $3 million in fraudulent PPP loan applications that falsely and fraudulently inflated the number of employees and payroll figures for the applicants. Prince charged a fee, typically, of around 20 percent of the value of the PPP loan. Prince pled guilty and is scheduled to be sentenced on Oct. 17, before U.S. District Judge Darrin P. Gayles.  This case was investigated by IRS-CI, FDIC-OIG, and HSI.  This case is being prosecuted by Senior Litigation Counsel Michael N. Berger.
“These charges demonstrate the FDIC OIG's commitment to working with our law enforcement partners to investigate allegations of fraud in COVID-19 relief programs and other financial crimes that threaten to undermine the safety and soundness of our Nation's financial institutions,” said Special Agent in Charge Kyle A. Myles, of the FDIC OIG Atlanta Region.
“It has been four years after the enactment of a key pandemic-era law and IRS-CI still continues to investigate cases related to the CARES Act,” said Matthew D. Line, Special Agent in Charge of the IRS-CI Miami Field Office. “These cases cover a wide range of criminal activity, including tax, money laundering, fraudulently obtained loans, credits and payments meant for American workers, families, and small businesses. In the last year alone, IRS-CI has opened nearly 700 new COVID fraud investigations nationwide that collectively add up to $5 billion. If you committed fraud, know that we are working hard every single day to find you and hold you accountable.”

PENNSYLVANIA MAN SENTENCED TO 78 MONTHS IN PRISON FOR $4.8 MILLION CARES ACT LOAN FRAUD SCHEME,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/pennsylvania-man-sentenced-78-months-prison-48-million-cares-act,"September 26, 2024",2024,"TRENTON, N.J. – A Pennsylvania man was sentenced today to 78 months in prison for his role in a scheme to fraudulently obtain over $4.8 million in federal Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) and Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL) for himself and others, U.S. Attorney Philip R. Sellinger announced.
Darryl Duanne Young, aka “Darryl Duanne Isom Young,” 61, of Kingston, Pennsylvania, pleaded guilty before U.S. District Judge Peter G. Sheridan in Trenton federal court on Nov. 14, 2023, to an information charging him with one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud and one count of money laundering. U.S. District Judge Georgette Castner imposed the sentence today in Trenton federal court.
“This defendant admitted taking advantage of government programs that were specifically designed to provide needed financial assistance to Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic,” U.S. Attorney Sellinger said. “Combatting pandemic fraud in all of its forms is a top priority for this office and our law enforcement partners. Together, we will continue to root out those who have exploited the suffering of others to line their own pockets, and bring them to justice.”
“COVID-19 relief funds were meant to assist honest, hardworking Americans during an unprecedented time of hardship in our country, not to aid those trying to enrich their lives through deception,” Special Agent in Charge Jenifer L. Piovesan, IRS Criminal Investigation, Newark Field Office, said. “Mr. Young’s sentence today reinforces that individuals who defraud our federal programs will be held accountable.”
“This sentencing should serve as a resounding message to anyone who wants to utilize the US Mail to defraud the American taxpayer. Postal Inspectors will continue to aggressively work with our partners in law enforcement and the US Attorney’s Office to hold these types of fraudsters accountable,” stated Christopher A. Nielsen, Inspector in Charge of the Philadelphia Division.
“Mr. Young and his fellow conspirators committed crimes and selfishly profited from the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loans; Mr. Young exploited Federal assistance programs intended to help those in need during a national crisis. This sentence now holds him accountable for his criminal acts,” said Michelle L. Anderson, Acting Inspector General for the SSA. “I thank our law enforcement partners for working to pursue perpetrators who fraudulently profit from Federal benefit programs. I appreciate the collaboration among the investigating agencies and the work of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for prosecuting this case.”
“Today’s sentencing sends a clear message that those who fraudulently obtained funds from COVID-19 relief programs will be held accountable,” Special Agent in Charge Patricia Tarasca of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC OIG) said. “The FDIC OIG remains committed to working with our law enforcement partners to investigate and bring to justice those who participate in fraudulent schemes and threaten to undermine the integrity of our Nation’s banking system.”
“Darryl Duanne Young defrauded the federal government of nearly $5 million in pandemic relief funds for his own personal gain and will now pay the price for his crimes,” said Brian Tucker, Special Agent in Charge, Eastern Region, Office of Inspector General for the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. “We are proud to have worked with our federal law enforcement partners and the U.S. Attorney’s Office to hold Mr. Young accountable for his crimes.”
“Young will serve time for selfishly pocketing millions of dollars in emergency funds our government intended to give qualified Americans and small businesses who needed economic assistance in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic,” said HSI Newark acting Special Agent in Charge Spiros Karabinas. “HSI Newark and our law enforcement partners are committed to ensuring justice is served in cases where individuals perpetrated illicit schemes for personal gain during an unprecedented public health crisis.”
According to documents filed in this case and statements made in court:
Young engaged in a scheme to illegally obtain for himself and his conspirators over $4.8 million in loans authorized by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. Young submitted and directed others to submit fraudulent PPP and EIDL loan applications, which fabricated numbers of employees and misrepresented company information, to induce lenders to approve the loan applications that they otherwise would not have approved. Among other things, Young submitted falsified tax documents and bank statements to a victim lender in support of PPP loan applications. Young personally received over $230,000 in PPP loans for businesses he controlled and received a percentage of loan proceeds for assisting in submitting fraudulent applications on behalf of others.
In addition to the prison term, Judge Castner sentenced Young to three years of supervised release and ordered restitution of $5.28 million.
U.S. Attorney Sellinger credited special agents of IRS-Criminal Investigation, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Jenifer L. Piovesan; postal inspectors of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service in Newark, under the direction of Inspector in Charge Christopher A. Nielsen Philadelphia Division; special agents of the Social Security Administration, Office of the Inspector General, under the direction of Acting Special Agent in Charge Corwin Rattler; special agents of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of New Jersey, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Thomas Mahoney; special agents of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System - Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Office of Inspector General, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Brian Tucker; special agents of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, Office of Inspector General, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Robert Manchak; special agents of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation – Office of the Inspector General, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Patricia Tarasca in New York; and special agents of Homeland Security Investigations Newark, under the direction of Acting Special Agent in Charge Spiros Karabinas, with the investigation leading to the sentencing.

Suburban Chicago Tax Professional Admits Stealing More Than $1.1 Million in Client Funds,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/suburban-chicago-tax-professional-admits-stealing-more-11,"September 18, 2024",2024,"CHICAGO — A suburban Chicago tax professional has admitted in federal court that he fraudulently obtained more than $1.1 million from more than ten clients under the false pretense that the money would be sent to the IRS and state revenue authorities to satisfy tax liabilities.
ADAM R. OLIVA, 43, of Rolling Meadows, Ill., pleaded guilty on Sept. 13, 2024, to one count of wire fraud and one count of preparing a false tax return.  The wire fraud count is punishable by up to 20 years in federal prison, while the tax count carries a maximum sentence of three years.  U.S. District Judge Andrea R. Wood set sentencing for Jan. 24, 2025.
Oliva held himself out as a tax professional who did business under various names, including Oliva and Associates LLC and The Oliva Group LLC.  Oliva admitted in a plea agreement that from 2015 to 2020, he fraudulently induced the clients to provide him with money for the purported purpose of paying the clients’ income taxes.  Oliva instead kept the money for himself.  Oliva also admitted that he filed false tax returns on behalf of some of the clients, reflecting no or lower tax liabilities in order to make it less likely that the IRS would contact the clients about their unpaid tax liabilities.
The guilty plea was announced by Morris Pasqual, Acting United States Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois, Ramsey E. Covington, Acting Special Agent-in-Charge of IRS Criminal Investigation Chicago Field Office, and Vincent R. Zehme, Special Agent-in-Charge of the Chicago Region of the FDIC’s Office of Inspector General.  The government is represented by Assistant U.S. Attorney Rick D. Young.
Earlier this year, Oliva pleaded guilty in a separate fraud case for duping investors who had provided him with money to fund purported short-term loans to clients.  Oliva promised the investors that they would receive returns of 10-20% on their investments.  In reality, Oliva never intended to make any short-term loans.  Instead, he pocketed the investors’ money and used it for personal expenses, including gambling, meals at restaurants, and retail purchases.  Oliva faces up to 20 years in prison in that case when he is sentenced on Oct. 18, 2024, by U.S. District Judge John J. Tharp, Jr.

Attorney Pleads Guilty to Obtaining Fraudulent Economic Injury Disaster Loans and Money Laundering,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/attorney-pleads-guilty-obtaining-fraudulent-economic-injury,"September 17, 2024",2024,"ATLANTA - Sanjay Patel, an attorney who formerly operated a Georgia-based real estate law firm, has pleaded guilty to fraudulently obtaining nearly $300,000 in Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL) during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to using his attorney escrow account to launder more than $250,000 from unrelated investor fraud schemes.
“This office will remain steadfast in coordinating with our federal law enforcement partners to identify and hold accountable those who defrauded the government’s COVID relief programs,” said U.S. Attorney Ryan K. Buchanan. “It is especially aggravating that Patel, an attorney, not only used his professional standing to commit money laundering, but he also defrauded the American taxpayer out of hundreds of thousands of dollars.”
“The U.S. Postal Inspection Service will continue to ensure fraudsters who sought to enrich themselves with funds from pandemic-assistance programs are held accountable,” said Tommy D. Coke, Inspector in Charge of the Atlanta Division. “This case serves as a reminder to individuals that engage in unlawful activity that law enforcement will spare no resource to bring you to justice for your criminal activity.”
“This guilty plea is a testament to our commitment to holding accountable those who engage in financial fraud,” said Edwin S. Bonano, Special Agent in Charge of FHFA-OIG’s Southeast Region.
“Even after four years, the FBI and our partners will continue to seek out anyone who abused their positions to defraud the government during the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Keri Farley, Special Agent in Charge of FBI Atlanta.  “This plea proves that no matter how much time has passed, if you commit financial crimes and steal from American taxpayers, you will be held accountable.”
According to U.S. Attorney Buchanan, the charges and other information presented in court: Between August 2020 and March 2021, Patel submitted four fraudulent EIDL loan applications to the Small Business Administration (SBA) seeking at least $421,000 to purportedly operate his business, including his law practice, Worden & Associates.
In the fraudulent applications, Patel repeatedly misrepresented the number of employees his law firm employed, its gross revenues, and in at least one application, the existence of his business. In reliance on Patel’s fraudulent misrepresentations, the SBA funded two of his loans totaling approximately $300,000.
After receiving the loan proceeds, Patel misused the funds for unauthorized purposes. EIDL loans are intended to be used for a business’s working capital to make regular payments for operating expenses, including payroll, rent/mortgage, utilities, and other ordinary business expenses, as well as to pay business debt incurred at any time. But Patel spent the fraudulent EIDL loan proceeds he received on various things, including spending the funds at casinos, personal expenses, and to make payments toward non-business loans.
Separately, Patel used his Interest on Lawyer Trust Account (IOLTA) to launder the proceeds from various investment frauds. For example, on May 14, 2020, Patel received $350,000 from an investor who believed the funds were going to be used for an energy project. But after receiving those funds, Patel immediately wired $250,000 to another entity, unrelated to the investment. Similarly, in June 2020, Patel received another $350,000 as part of a different energy investment. After receiving this investor money, Patel laundered over $132,000 by conducting a series of wire transfers to other accounts unrelated to the investment. Although Patel was not involved in the underlying fraudulent activity, he knew that these funds were derived from various investor fraud schemes.
Sanjay Patel, 45, of Mobile, Alabama, is scheduled to be sentenced on December 12, 2024, at 3:00 p.m. before U.S. District Judge Steve C. Jones.
This case is being investigated by the United States Postal Inspection Service, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Federal Housing Finance Agency - Office of Inspector General, and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation - Office of Inspector General.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Alex R. Sistla is prosecuting the case.
On May 17, 2021, the Attorney General established the COVID-19 Fraud Enforcement Task Force to marshal the resources of the Department of Justice in partnership with agencies across government to enhance efforts to combat and prevent pandemic-related fraud. The Task Force bolsters efforts to investigate and prosecute the most culpable domestic and international criminal actors and assists agencies tasked with administering relief programs to prevent fraud by, among other methods, augmenting and incorporating existing coordination mechanisms, identifying resources and techniques to uncover fraudulent actors and their schemes, and sharing and harnessing information and insights gained from prior enforcement efforts.

Former Southern Pine Credit Union Finance Officer Sentenced to Prison,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/former-southern-pine-credit-union-finance-officer-sentenced,"September 13, 2024",2024,"Defendant Ordered to Pay $1.2+ Million in Restitution to the Credit Union
VALDOSTA, Ga. – The former Controller of Southern Pine Credit Union in Valdosta was sentenced to serve five years in prison and pay back more than $1.2 million in restitution after she admitted to a long-running bank loan and aggravated identity theft scheme.
Teresa Paulo, of Valdosta, was sentenced to serve 24 months imprisonment for aggravated identity theft and 36 months imprisonment for bank fraud to be served consecutively for a total of 60 months in prison on Sept. 12. In addition, Paulo was ordered to pay $1,238,638.29 in restitution to Southern Pine Credit Union. Paulo pleaded guilty to these charges on Nov. 2, 2023.
Leah Lehman, 63, of Valdosta, was sentenced to serve 24 months imprisonment for aggravated identity theft and 48 months imprisonment for bank fraud to be served consecutively for a total of 72 months in prison on May 30. In addition, Lehman was ordered to pay $4,491,253.97 in restitution to Southern Pine Credit Union. Lehman pleaded guilty to these charges on Oct. 26, 2023.
U.S. District Judge W. Louis Sands is presiding over these cases. The defendants are not eligible for parole.
“Financial fraud has a far-reaching ripple effect that negatively impacts people, businesses and the community,” said U.S. Attorney Peter D. Leary. “We take financial crimes seriously, and we will work alongside our law enforcement partners to hold fraudsters accountable.”
“These sentencings are the direct result of a diligent investigation by hardworking FBI employees and our partners at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of Inspector General,” said Rich Bilson, Senior Supervisory Resident Agent of FBI Atlanta’s Valdosta office. “The defendants’ greed driven scheme stole hundreds of thousands of dollars and damaged the financial security of innocent victims. They will now be held accountable for their blatant misuse of the power of their positions.”
“The criminal behavior in these cases represent the most egregious betrayal of trust by two of this institution’s leaders, resulting in years of ill-gotten gains for the defendants, all while violating the faith that SPCU’s members placed in them,” said Kyle A. Myles, Special Agent in Charge of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of Inspector General, Atlanta Region. “We are
grateful to our regulatory and law enforcement partners in this case and will continue to vigorously investigate allegations of financial crime at FDIC-supervised institutions and in support of our fellow financial regulators.”
According to court documents and statements referenced in court, Paulo was Southern Pine Credit Union’s (SPCU) controller from Oct. 2011 to June 2020 and Lehman served as President of SPCU from 1990 to 2020. The Credit Union’s members are employees of the local paper mill and their families.
Lehman began her fraud in June 2003, when she created a share secured loan in a SPCU account using the name and social security number of a member without that individual’s knowledge. From Feb. 2012 to May 31, 2020, Lehman paid off the loan and rebooked it multiple times with additional advances. She would take the proceeds and put them in a joint share draft account she had with the individual, using the proceeds to pay for a boat, a hunting club share, personal expenses and gifts to family members. This loan was repaid in full. However, Lehman created another share secured loan in another individual’s name without their knowledge and would also pay off the loan and rebook it multiple times for personal spending. To conceal these activities, Lehman created false credit transactions using the names and passwords of SPCU employees. These transactions would advance the due date on the loans, which prevented these loans from appearing on quarterly call reports to the NCUA and allowed Lehman to defer or not make payment on these loans. Following these transactions, Lehman created debit entries to put the loans back on the accounts, which would often include interest accrued on the outstanding loans. She made additional fraudulent loan advances simultaneously with those entries to advance the loan dates. She reflected the loans as being paid off at the end of the quarter to prevent possible detection of artificial growth in the SPCU loan portfolio. In total, the drafts needed to pay off the loan balances at each quarter grew to $4,112,870.63, excluding payments and interest, as of May 31, 2020.
Paulo committed a similar fraud scheme to Lehman. In Oct. 2011, Paulo created a share secured loan in a SPCU account using the name and social security number of a member without that individual’s knowledge. From Nov. 2011 until May 29, 2020, Paulo took out additional advances on the loan as well as additional loans from the account. Paulo would transfer the loan proceeds into a joint account for personal spending purposes. She created another share secured account using the personal identity of another individual and would pay off the loan and rebook it multiple times with additional advances, using the proceeds for her own personal expenses or electronically transfer money into her family’s accounts. Paulo concealed her schemes as Lehman concealed hers: creating false credit transactions using the usernames and passwords of SPCU employees to simulate the payoff of the loans, which would advance the due date on the loans. Paulo also created debit entries using other people’s usernames and passwords to put the loans back on the accounts, which would often include interest accrued on the outstanding loans. The drafts needed to pay off the loan balances at each quarter grew to $1,233,201.77, excluding payments and interest, as of May 31, 2020. Paulo made $7,736.16 in legitimate payments to the loan balances.
These cases were investigated by the FBI and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of Inspector General (FDIC OIG).
Assistant U.S. Attorney Hannah Couch prosecuted these cases for the Government.

"Par Funding Principals Plead Guilty to RICO Conspiracy, Securities Fraud, Obstruction of Justice, Related Charges",https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/par-funding-principals-plead-guilty-rico-conspiracy-securities,"September 11, 2024",2024,"PHILADELPHIA – United States Attorney Jacqueline C. Romero announced that Joseph LaForte, 53, of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and his brother James LaForte, 47, of New York, New York, entered pleas of guilty today before United States District Court Judge Mark A. Kearney to racketeering conspiracy, securities fraud, and related crimes in connection with their operation of a fraudulent investment vehicle known as Complete Business Solutions Group Inc. d/b/a Par Funding (“Par Funding”), which is alleged to have generated over $100 million in illegal proceeds for the defendants to the detriment of Par Funding’s numerous investors, many who live in the Philadelphia region.
Joseph LaForte operated Par Funding’s day-to-day operations and functioned as its president and CEO, while his younger brother James LaForte worked in sales and collections and had managerial authority. In July 2020, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) intervened and replaced the LaFortes with a court-ordered receivership that has operated Par Funding since that time.
Joseph LaForte, who has prior felony convictions including for a financial fraud, also pleaded guilty to tax crimes, perjury, and obstruction of justice for his role in aiding and abetting James LaForte’s violent assault on one of the Par Funding receivership’s Philadelphia attorneys who was helping to seize LaForte family assets. In addition, Joseph LaForte pleaded guilty to a gun possession charge for firearms that were found in his former residence during the execution of a search warrant.
James LaForte also pleaded guilty to the extortionate collection of credit from a Par Funding merchant customer, as well as obstruction of justice for assaulting the Philadelphia attorney and retaliation for threatening several government witnesses.
The government and the defendants have agreed that defendant Joseph LaForte will serve between 13½ to 15½ years’ imprisonment and defendant James LaForte will serve 110 to 137 months’ (~9 to 11½ years’) imprisonment, provided those ranges are accepted by the district court at the time of sentencing. Defendant Joseph LaForte has also agreed to pay millions of dollars in restitution to the Internal Revenue Service in connection with his tax conviction, and to forfeit his rights to a private jet and an investment account seized by the government. At the plea hearing, Judge Kearney accepted the guilty plea for Joseph LaForte and conditionally accepted the guilty plea for James LaForte.
In February, the defendants had been charged with violating the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) in a second superseding indictment, which also charged various other crimes included in a previous superseding indictment, including securities fraud, wire fraud, extortionate collection of debt, obstruction of justice, witness tampering, and witness retaliation, tax crimes, and perjury.
Per the indictment, as part of their fundraising efforts, these defendants and their conspirators caused false and misleading information to be conveyed to investors regarding various issues, including:
For instance, although Joseph LaForte operated Par Funding and referred to it as his business, he concealed this ownership and control by using his wife as his nominee. Joseph LaForte also used several aliases, such as “Joe Mack,” while working at the company. It is alleged that Joseph LaForte, James LaForte, and their conspirators engaged in this deception to conceal Joseph LaForte’s true role as the person operating the company and his significant criminal history from investors.
The indictment also alleged that Par Funding’s principal means of generating income was to “advance” money to businesses that were in need of short-term financing at high rates of return. The indictment alleged that the enterprise, including James LaForte, used threats of violence to collect money from customers whose payments were overdue. James LaForte has pleaded guilty to threatening one particular Par Funding customer, telling him that he must repay the company immediately because James LaForte was not to be messed with and had previously torched people’s cars and kicked people’s teeth in.
The indictment also alleged that Joseph LaForte and James LaForte engaged in obstruction of justice in late February 2023 in connection with James LaForte’s physical assault of one of the Par Funding receivership’s attorneys outside of the attorney’s office in Center City Philadelphia, sending the attorney to the hospital and causing serious bodily injury. Several days later, defendant James LaForte is alleged to have made threatening phone calls to several government witnesses and their family members, including Perry Abbonizio, who James LaForte knew had recently pleaded guilty to conspiring with Joseph LaForte in connection with the fraudulent operation of Par Funding.
Finally, Joseph LaForte and others were also charged with committing a variety of tax crimes involving the proceeds he received from Par Funding, including hiding tens of millions of taxable income via false entries on business and personal federal tax returns and pretending to live in Florida to avoid paying Pennsylvania income tax. In April 2024, LaForte’s wife, Lisa McElhone, pleaded guilty in connection with the Florida residency scheme. It was further alleged that Joseph LaForte failed to report millions of dollars in cash kickbacks that he personally received from a Par Funding merchant customer, and by regularly paying cash wages to Par Funding employees but not withholding taxes from these wages or reporting them to the IRS.
“The LaFortes’ corrupt enterprise was built on a foundation of lies, threats, and incredible greed,” said U.S. Attorney Romero. “The breadth of the criminal activity here is astounding – from financial fraud to physical violence, obstruction of justice, and more. On behalf of those victimized, justice demands that these perpetrators be held accountable.”
“Investigating complex financial crimes has been a priority of the FBI since our beginning,” said Wayne A. Jacobs, Special Agent in Charge of FBI Philadelphia. “The defendants ran their purported business as a criminal enterprise, conducting securities fraud, extortion, and obstruction of justice, all to further their financial gain. This case exemplifies the FBI and our partners’ continued commitment to vigorously pursue these criminals who orchestrate these schemes and bring them to justice.”
“IRS-Criminal Investigation is proud to have provided its financial expertise in this investigation,” said Amy MacNeely, Acting Special Agent in Charge of IRS-Criminal Investigation. “We, along with our law enforcement partners and the Department of Justice, will continue to aggressively investigate individuals who engage in money laundering, tax fraud, or other types of white-collar crimes.”
“The guilty pleas in this case hold the defendants accountable for operating a fraudulent investment vehicle that allegedly generated over $100 million illegally, and caused financial harm to numerous investors,” said Patricia Tarasca, Special Agent in Charge of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC OIG), New York Region.  “The FDIC OIG is pleased to join our law enforcement colleagues in announcing this guilty plea, and we remain committed to investigating and bringing to justice those who commit such egregious acts that threaten investors and the safety and soundness of our Nation's financial system.”
The case was investigated by the FBI, Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigation, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General and prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys Matthew Newcomer, Samuel Dalke, Eric Gill, Patrick J. Murray, and former Assistant U.S. Attorney Alexandra Lastowski, as well as Assistant U.S. Attorney John J. Boscia and DOJ Trial Attorney Ezra Spiro on the tax portion of the prosecution.
The SEC in Florida investigated and litigated the civil securities fraud charges, which formed the basis of a portion of the criminal prosecution.

Nevada Man Convicted of $11.2M COVID-19 Fraud,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/nevada-man-convicted-112m-covid-19-fraud,"September 6, 2024",2024,"A federal jury convicted a Nevada man today for defrauding three banks of more than $11.2 million in COVID-19 pandemic relief funds intended to help small businesses impacted by the pandemic.
According to court documents and evidence presented at trial, Meelad Dezfooli, 30, of Henderson, engaged in a scheme to submit fraudulent loan applications under the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), a program that provided loans to help small businesses continue paying employee salaries and certain other basic business expenses during the pandemic. Dezfooli submitted three fraudulent PPP loan applications to federally insured banks, purportedly for the benefit of companies that the defendant controlled, and obtained more than $11.2 million in proceeds from those loans.
The evidence at trial showed that Dezfooli falsely represented certain material information in his loan applications, including information about payroll, employees, and use of the loan proceeds. After fraudulently obtaining more than $11.2 million in PPP funds, Dezfooli laundered and/or spent the proceeds by, among other things: buying approximately 25 residences and two luxury cars, funding a personal investment account, and gambling extensively. After he was originally charged, Dezfooli continued laundering criminal proceeds by selling five of the residences that he acquired with the fraudulently obtained PPP funds.
The jury convicted Dezfooli of three counts of bank fraud, three counts of money laundering, and four counts of engaging in monetary transactions in criminally derived property. He is scheduled to be sentenced on Dec. 5 and faces a maximum penalty of 30 years in prison on each of the bank fraud counts, 20 years in prison on each of the money laundering counts, and 10 years in prison on each of the counts of engaging in monetary transactions in criminally derived property. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.

"Three Individuals Indicted in Mortgage, COVID-19 Relief Program Fraud Schemes",https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/three-individuals-indicted-mortgage-covid-19-relief-program,"September 3, 2024",2024,"CAMDEN, N.J. – Three New Jersey residents were indicted for their role in a multimillion-dollar mortgage fraud scheme and two of the three were indicted for fraudulently obtaining approximately $3 million of federal Economic Injury Disaster Loans, U.S. Attorney Philip R. Sellinger announced today.
Arthur Spitzer, 37, of Toms River, New Jersey, is charged with eight counts of wire fraud, one count of bank fraud, one count of bank and wire fraud conspiracy, two counts of aggravated identity theft, one count of making a false statement to a financial institution, and 12 counts of money laundering. Mendel Deutsch, 38, of Toms River, is charged with three counts of wire fraud, one count of bank fraud, one count of bank and wire fraud conspiracy, one count of aggravated identity theft, one count of making a false statement to a financial institution, and two counts of money laundering. Joshua Feldberger, 42, of Howell, New Jersey, is charged with one count of wire fraud, one count of bank fraud, one count of bank and wire fraud conspiracy, one count of aggravated identity theft, and one count of making a false statement to a financial institution. The defendants were arraigned today before U.S. District Judge Edward S. Kiel in Camden federal court.
According to the indictment:
In 2019 and 2020, Spitzer orchestrated a scheme to defraud property owners and mortgage lenders by obtaining mortgage loans for real estate properties that he did not own.   Spitzer identified properties in New Jersey and Brooklyn, New York, that had either no mortgages or mortgages in amounts significantly lower than the property’s market value. On six occasions, Spitzer obtained mortgage loans by misrepresenting that he had the authority to obtain mortgage loans secured by properties he did not own. Spitzer used fraudulent documents purporting to transfer control to him, which contained forged signatures of the true property owners. The mortgage loan proceeds were disbursed to bank accounts controlled by Spitzer or were used to otherwise benefit Spitzer, such as to pay off his debts. Spitzer then caused the mortgage loans to default by not making the required payments, leaving the true property owners subject to foreclosure and eviction.
In June 2020, Spitzer conspired with Deutsch and Feldberger to make it appear as if Spitzer owned three properties in Brooklyn, and agreed to sell them to Deutsch, who obtained a $4 million mortgage loan in connection with the transaction. Feldberger facilitated the fraudulent transaction as the owner of the settlement company that handled the transaction. The defendants created and sent letters stating that Deutsch had deposited significant funds into escrow toward the transaction, when in reality he had not; they created fake documentation purportedly transferring control of the properties to Spitzer; they failed to disclose a short-term loan obtained shortly before the transaction’s closing; and they lied to the mortgage lender by stating that the settlement company had received more than $2 million from Deutsch at closing, which led the mortgage lender to fund the loan. The defendants then used the mortgage loan proceeds to fund Deutsch’s down payment, which he had supposedly already provided.
In 2020 and 2021, Spitzer and Deutsch each fraudulently obtained millions of dollars of government loans that were intended for small businesses distressed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act is a federal law enacted in March 2020 and was designed to provide emergency financial assistance to the millions of Americans who are suffering the economic effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act authorized the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) to provide Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDLs) of up to $2 million to eligible small businesses that were experiencing substantial financial disruption due to the COVID-19 pandemic. To obtain an EIDL loan, a qualifying small business was required to apply and provide information on its operations, including the number of employees and revenues or expenses.
Spitzer and Deutsch obtained EIDL loans for businesses that had little or no operations by submitting loan applications that included false statements about the applicant companies’ number of employees, revenues, cost of goods sold, or lost rents.
The counts of bank fraud conspiracy, bank fraud, and making a false statement to a financial institution, are each punishable by a maximum of 30 years in prison and a $1,000,000 fine. The counts of wire fraud conspiracy and wire fraud are each punishable by a maximum of 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine, or twice the gross gain or loss from the offense. The counts of money laundering are each punishable by a maximum of 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine, or twice the gross gain or loss from the offense. The counts of aggravated identity theft carry a mandatory two-year prison sentence.
U.S. Attorney Sellinger credited special agents of the FBI, Atlantic City Resident Agency, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge James E. Dennehy in Newark; special agents of IRS – Criminal Investigation, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Jenifer L. Piovesan in Newark; and special agents of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation – Office of Inspector General, under the direction of Patricia Tarasca, Special Agent-in-Charge, New York Regional Office, with the investigation leading to the charges.
The government is represented by Assistant U.S. Attorney Daniel A. Friedman of the U.S. Attorney’s Office’s Criminal Division in Camden.
The charges and allegations contained in the charging instrument are merely accusations, and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.

Owner of San Diego-based Shammas Funding Inc. Pleads Guilty to Fraudulently Obtaining $5 Million in Pandemic-Related Loans,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/owner-san-diego-based-shammas-funding-inc-pleads-guilty,"August 29, 2024",2024,"NEWS RELEASE SUMMARY – August 29, 2024
SAN DIEGO – Andre Shammas, owner of Shammas Funding Inc., pleaded guilty in federal court today to fraud charges, admitting that he submitted bogus applications for more than $5 million in pandemic-related loans intended to help struggling businesses during the pandemic.
Shammas admitted using his accounting and tax preparation business, Shammas Funding, to illegally apply for more than 40 loans from the Paycheck Protection Program known as PPP.
The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act was enacted to provide emergency financial assistance to Americans suffering economic harm as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act established the PPP, under which banks would make forgivable loans to small businesses, so that those businesses could keep their doors open and employees on their payroll. If a business used the money for payroll and other eligible business expenses, the loans would be forgiven, and the federal government’s Small Business Administration would pay back the bank.
According to court documents, Shammas solicited and recruited clients of Shammas’s tax preparation business and people to apply for fraudulent PPP loans. Shammas then prepared fraudulent tax and other documentation to support fraudulent PPP loan applications. Co-conspirators then prepared and filed the PPP applications using the fraudulent documentation provided by Shammas.
Some examples include:
To induce the Small Business Administration and banks to approve the fraudulent PPP loans, Shammas and his co-conspirators included false and fraudulent statements in the loan applications, including false representations regarding the number of employees, the average monthly payroll, and the gross receipts earned by these purported businesses.
“The Paycheck Protection Program served as a lifeline to many businesses desperately trying to stay afloat during the pandemic,” said U.S. Attorney Tara McGrath. “These charges will hold Shammas accountable for abusing this critical program.”
“As an accountant and tax preparer, Mr. Shammas is a gatekeeper who has a responsibility to do what is right for both his clients and the system. Mr. Shammas blatantly ignored that responsibility, and instead recruited clients to join his criminal conspiracy,” said FDIC OIG Special Agent in Charge Ryan L. Korner.  We are proud to work alongside our law enforcement partners to protect our nation’s financial system and bring to justice individuals, like Mr. Shammas, who defraud our system to line their own pockets, while stealing benefits designated for those most in need during the pandemic.”
“Conspiring to defraud programs aimed at assisting small businesses that struggled to survive the pandemic is both unacceptable and reprehensible,” said SBA OIG’s Western Region Special Agent in Charge Weston King. “Our office is committed to ensuring that SBA funds reach those who truly need them and are not diverted by fraudulent schemes. I want to thank the U.S. Attorney’s Office and our law enforcement partners in bringing those who exploit these programs to justice.”
Shammas is scheduled to be sentenced on November 18, 2024, at 9 a.m. before U.S. District Judge Thomas Whelan.
This case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark Conover.

Springfield Restaurant Owner Sentenced to 18 Months in Prison for His Role in Submitting Fraudulent Loan Applications,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/springfield-restaurant-owner-sentenced-18-months-prison-his-role,"August 29, 2024",2024,"SPRINGFIELD, Ill. – A Springfield, Illinois, man, Omar Hernandez-Lopez, 39, was sentenced today to 18 months’ imprisonment for concealment of a felony in connection with wire fraud and false statements on loan applications. Following his prison sentence, he will serve a 12-month term of supervised release.
At Hernandez-Lopez’s sentencing hearing, Senior U.S. District Judge Sue E. Myerscough, found that starting around June 2018 and continuing until at least June 2019, Hernandez-Lopez was aware of and acted to conceal the fraudulent nature of several falsified documents that were submitted to loan providers. Two fraudulent loan packages were submitted in an unsuccessful attempt to obtain a business loan for Hernandez-Lopez’s Springfield restaurant, La Fiesta Grande. The other two fraudulent loan packages were submitted in a successful attempt to obtain a home mortgage loan. Hernandez-Lopez was aware of the submission of fraudulent documents and took steps to conceal their fraudulent nature from the loan companies and law enforcement.
At the sentencing hearing, the government presented evidence showing that Hernandez-Lopez’s name is on the deed of the house for the fraudulently obtained mortgage and he operated the restaurant.
The sentencing follows Hernandez-Lopez’s guilty plea in April 2024. The statutory penalties for misprision of a felony are up to three years’ imprisonment, one year of supervised release, and a fine of up to $250,000.
The charges were investigated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General, Chicago Region. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Sierra Senor-Moore and Tanner Jacobs represented the government in the prosecution.

Craig David Davis, 49, of Venice, was the owner of Bright Vanguard LLC., which he held out as a computer hardware retailer and storage space provider. According to court documents, in 2020, Davis submitted at least two PPP loan applications and one MSLP loan application on behalf of Bright Vanguard. In those applications, Davis falsely claimed Bright Vanguard had substantial sales and as many as 17 employees. In reality, Bright Vanguard had no employees and no legitimate revenue. To substantiate his claims, Davis presented fraudulent tax returns, payroll documents, and financial statements to at least three different banks.
Davis also admitted to participating in a years-long scheme to defraud commercial equipment lenders using fraudulent invoices. Davis directed business owners to submit loan applications to banks to purchase computer equipment evidenced on invoices they received from companies such as Bright Vanguard. The lenders approved the loans and submitted the proceeds to accounts controlled by Davis or his co-conspirators. Davis and his co-conspirators then remitted the majority of the proceeds to applicant borrowers, keeping a portion for themselves, without providing the equipment shown on the invoices. This scheme caused more than $60 million of fraudulently induced lending across more than 350 separate loans.
Davis is scheduled to be sentenced on Dec. 12. He faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after taking into account the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.

Maryland Man Sentenced For Fraudulently Obtaining More Than $3.5 Million In Covid-19 Cares Act Loans,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/maryland-man-sentenced-fraudulently-obtaining-more-35-million,"August 28, 2024",2024,"Used the Proceeds to Purchase Property, a Luxury Vehicle and Pay His Personal Expenses
Greenbelt , Maryland – On Tuesday, August 27, 2024, the Honorable Deborah L. Boardman sentenced Rudolph Brooks, age 48, of Cheltenham, Maryland, to 18 months in federal prison followed by 2 years of supervised release for fraudulently obtaining over $3.5 million in COVID-19 Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act Payroll Protection Program (PPP) loans. The Court also ordered Brooks to forfeit all property and assets derived from or obtained as a result of his criminal activity, including a 2018 Tesla Model 3, property located in Upper Marlboro, Maryland, and at least $2,231,141.49 from 17 bank accounts controlled by Brooks.
The sentence was announced by Erek L. Barron, U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland Erek L. Barron; Special Agent in Charge, Jeffrey D. Pittano, of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General, Mid-Atlantic Region; Special Agent in Charge Kareem A. Carter of the Internal Revenue Service - Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI), Washington, D.C. Field Office; Special Agent in Charge William J. DelBagno of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Baltimore Field Office; and Special Agent in Charge Amaleka McCall-Brathwaite, Eastern Region Investigations Division of the U.S. Small Business Administration Office of Inspector General (SBA OIG).
The CARES Act was enacted in March 2020 to provide emergency financial assistance to Americans suffering from the economic consequences of COVID-19.  The CARES Act authorized forgivable loans to small businesses for employee retention and certain business expenses through the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”).
According to court documents, between April 2020 and September 2021, Brooks, who at times served as pastor at Kingdom Tabernacle of Restoration Ministries, participated in a scheme to fraudulently obtain PPP loans, used the loan proceeds for his personal enrichment, and concealed his misappropriation of the funds by laundering the loan proceeds. As stated in the plea agreement, Brooks used several entities to apply for PPP loans, including Cars Direct by Gavawn HWD Bob’s Motors (Cars Direct), Kingdom Tabernacle of Restoration Ministries, and Madaro, LLC.  In each case, Brooks grossly inflated the number of employees and average monthly payroll, and submitted fraudulent IRS Forms 940, Employer’s Annual Federal Unemployment Tax Return, and other fraudulent IRS forms to support the loan applications.
For example, on May 12, 2020, Brooks received $1,556,589 in fraudulently-obtained PPP loan proceeds, deposited directly into a Cars Direct bank account on which Brooks was the sole signator.  He also received $1.8 million in fraudulently obtained PPP loan proceeds, deposited directly into a Kingdom Tabernacle bank account on which Brooks was the sole signator.  Similarly, on May 13, 2020, Brooks received $204,266 in such proceeds, deposited directly into a Madaro bank account in which Brooks was the sole signator.
Brooks admitted that he used the loan proceeds for his personal benefit and on payments and purchases not permissible under PPP, such as for a residence; for a luxury vehicle; and, for restaurant, retail store and grocery purchases.  Brooks also made cash withdrawals and transfers to other accounts under his control.  For example, Brooks opened a bank account in the name of Payroll by BJM, into which he transferred $500,000 of the Cars Direct PPP loan proceeds.  Brooks also registered Payroll by BJM with the Maryland State Department of Assessments and Taxation, listing himself as “member” and sole signator.  Although the name Payroll by BJM created the appearance that the account was associated with a payroll company, there were no payroll or payroll-related expenses paid from this account.
In addition, Brooks initiated numerous transfers of PPP loan funds, totaling approximately $196,000, from the Cars Direct account to his personal bank accounts. Of this amount, Brooks wired $60,407 to Tesla Motors Inc. on July 30, 2020, to purchase a 2018 Tesla Model 3 in the name of Brooks’ son, which was ultimately registered in Maryland in Brooks’ own name.
On February 5, 2021, Brooks transferred $750,000 in proceeds from the Kingdom Tabernacle PPP loan to a bank account in the name of Madaro, for which Brooks was the sole signator.  On May 17, 2021, Brooks initiated a wire transfer of $507,010 to a title company to purchase property in Upper Marlboro, Maryland, in the name of “Rudolph Brooks.”
The District of Maryland Strike Force is one of three strike forces established throughout the United States by the U.S. Department of Justice to investigate and prosecute COVID-19 fraud, including fraud relating to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act.  The CARES Act was designed to provide emergency financial assistance to Americans suffering the economic effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.  The strike forces focus on large-scale, multi-state pandemic relief fraud perpetrated by criminal organizations and transnational actors.  The strike forces are interagency law enforcement efforts, using prosecutor-led and data analyst-driven teams designed to identify and bring to justice those who stole pandemic relief funds.

Former CEO of failed bank sentenced to prison,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/former-ceo-failed-bank-sentenced-prison,"August 19, 2024",2024,"WICHITA, KAN. – A Kansas man was sentenced to 293 months in prison for using his former position as chief executive officer (CEO) of a bank to embezzle tens of millions of dollars in a cryptocurrency scheme which led the bank to fail at a complete loss of equity for investors.
According to court documents, Shan Hanes, 53, of Elkhart pleaded guilty to one count of embezzlement by a bank officer.
While the CEO of Heartland Tri-State Bank (HTSB) in Elkhart, Kansas, Hanes initiated 11 outgoing wire transfers between May 2023 and July 2023 totaling $47.1 million of Heartland’s funds to a cryptocurrency wallet in a cryptocurrency scheme referred to as “pig butchering.” The funds were transferred to multiple cryptocurrency accounts controlled by unidentified third parties during the time HTSB was insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The FDIC absorbed the $47.1 million loss. Hanes’ fraudulent actions caused HTSB to fail and the bank investors to lose $9 million.
A federal judge ordered that restitution be finalized at a separate hearing within the next 90 days.
“Hanes’ greed knew no bounds. He trespassed his professional obligations, his personal relationships, and federal law. Not only did Shan Hanes betray Heartland Bank and its investors, but his illegal schemes also jeopardized confidence in financial institutions,” said U.S. Attorney Kate E. Brubacher. “Today’s sentence is a measure of justice for the victims, and a statement that the U.S. Department of Justice will hold those accountable who violate positions of trust for their own gain.”
“Mr. Hanes, as the CEO of Heartland Tri-State Bank, held the trust and confidence of the community of Elkhart, KS, but he violated that trust.  He attempted to benefit financially by embezzling funds from the bank.  His idea to get rich quick, in all reality, was a pig butchering scheme.  His involvement in this scheme ultimately led to the bank’s collapse. His job, the bank’s job was to protect its customers and identify fraudulent scams – not to participate in them,” said Special Agent in Charge Stephen Cyrus of the FBI Kansas City Field Office.
“As the CEO, the defendant had a duty to conduct business honestly but instead abused that trust and committed insider fraud, contributing to the failure of a bank and causing catastrophic losses to bank customers who relied on the bank for the safekeeping of their savings,” said Korey Brinkman, Special-Agent-in-Charge of FHFA-OIG’s Central Region. “We will continue to vigorously investigate criminal offenses involving frauds that impact the integrity, safety, and soundness of Federal Home Loan Banks and member banks. We are proud to partner with our colleagues and the United States Attorney’s Office with this investigation.”
“Shan Hanes was sentenced today for his role in a $47.1 million embezzlement scheme that ultimately caused Heartland Tri-State Bank to fail,” said Special Agent in Charge Justin R. Bundy of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC OIG) Kansas City Region. “We are pleased to join our law enforcement partners in bringing Mr. Hanes to justice, and we will continue to investigate and hold accountable bank insiders who violate their positions of trust and threaten to undermine the safety and soundness of our Nation’s financial institutions.”
“Today’s sentencing makes clear that bank executives who undermine the safety and soundness of community banks will be brought to justice,” said Jon Ellwanger, Special Agent in Charge, Western Region, Office of Inspector General for the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. “We are proud to have worked with our federal law enforcement partners to achieve this result, and we thank the U.S. Attorney’s Office for prosecuting this case and holding Mr. Hanes accountable for his crimes.”
The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation – Office of Inspector General (FDIC-OIG), Federal Reserve Board - Office of Inspector General (FRB-OIG), and Federal Housing Finance Agency – Office of Inspector General ((FHFA-OIG) investigated the case.

Former Attorney Sentenced to 25 Years in Federal Prison on Embezzlement and Fraud Charges in Connection With Collapse of Washington Federal Bank,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/former-attorney-sentenced-25-years-federal-prison-embezzlement,"August 14, 2024",2024,"CHICAGO — A former attorney has been sentenced to 25 years in federal prison for embezzlement and fraud in connection with the failure of Washington Federal Bank for Savings in Chicago.
ROBERT M. KOWALSKI served a key role in an embezzlement scheme at Washington Federal.  The bank, which was based in Chicago’s Bridgeport neighborhood, was shut down in 2017 after the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency determined that it was insolvent and had at least $66 million in nonperforming loans.  Much of the money was transferred to Kowalski, who at the time was a licensed attorney, and two real estate developers without all of the required documentation and often without any documentation whatsoever.  The embezzled funds were falsely identified in the bank’s records as loan disbursements, even though the bank never required Kowalski to repay the money.
After the collapse of the bank, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. attempted to collect the money and properties that Kowalski obtained as part of the embezzlement scheme.  Kowalski responded by filing a fraudulent bankruptcy case, in which he attempted to conceal his possession of numerous assets.  To substantiate numerous misrepresentations in his bankruptcy filings and avoid paying taxes, Kowalski filed false corporate and personal tax returns for several years.  He also failed to file any returns at all for two years.
Kowalski, 62, of Robbins, Ill., was convicted last year of embezzlement, bankruptcy fraud, and tax fraud charges.  In addition to the prison term, U.S. District Chief Judge Virginia M. Kendall on Tuesday ordered Kowalski to pay restitution of $7.2 million to the FDIC and $424,047 to the IRS.

Zehme, Special Agent-in-Charge of the Chicago Region of the FDIC’s Office of Inspector General; Machelle L.

Owner Of Orlando Company Sentenced To 24 Years In Federal Prison For $57 Million Investment Fraud Scheme,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/owner-orlando-company-sentenced-24-years-federal-prison-57,"August 8, 2024",2024,"Orlando, FL – U.S. District Judge Carlos Mendoza has sentenced Avinash Singh (42, St. Cloud) to 24 years in federal prison for wire fraud and money laundering. The court also ordered Singh to forfeit the $57 million in proceeds he obtained from his offenses, as well as real property that he purchased with those proceeds. Singh entered a guilty plea on May 6, 2024.
According to court documents, Singh operated an Orlando-based company by the name of Highrise Advantage, LLC (Highrise). From February 2013 to September 2020, Singh received more than $57 million from over 1,100 victims who believed that they were making investments in retail foreign currency contracts (forex) through Highrise. To induce his victims to invest, Singh claimed that he had a proven track record of success as a forex trader, that he was going to use the funds for investments in forex, and that he would “guarantee” that his victims would not lose any funds for any trading losses. None of these representations were true.
Rather than invest his victims’ funds in forex trading as he had promised, Singh used funds from one investor to pay amounts owed to another investor. Singh misappropriated at least $45 million of the victims’ “investments” in the form of payments to other investors and also spent millions of dollars in personal expenses, including the purchase of real estate, retail purchases, phone bills, events, dining, and reserving music studio space to record music with his band.
“This case epitomizes selfish greed at an astonishing level,” said Ron Loecker, Special Agent in Charge of IRS Criminal Investigation’s Tampa Field Office. “Mr. Singh tried to use the proceeds of his Ponzi scheme to live like a pop star while popping the dreams of his victim investors. This sentencing shows that we will go to great lengths to ensure those who try to illegally place themselves above others are held accountable.”
This case was investigated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation - Office of Inspector General, the St. Cloud IRS Federal Financial Crimes Task Force, and the State of Florida Office of Financial Regulation, with assistance from the U.S. Marshals Service. It was prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Amanda S. Daniels. Asset recovery was handled by Assistant United States Attorney Nicole M. Andrejko.

Washington man who scammed pandemic relief programs sentenced to over five years in prison,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/washington-man-who-scammed-pandemic-relief-programs-sentenced,"August 2, 2024",2024,"ALEXANDRIA, Va. – A Washington man was sentenced today to five years and three months in prison for wire fraud.
According to court documents, from at least June 2020 through at least June 2021, Clayton Rosenberg, aka Kenneth Clayton and Kobe, 31, and his co-conspirators submitted fraudulent applications to defraud multiple COVID-19 relief programs.  Rosenberg used these stolen funds to increase his typical lifestyle, including luxury vehicle purchases and $1,800 for beard care products.
The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act provided emergency financial assistance expeditiously to Americans suffering the economic effects caused by the pandemic. The Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) authorized forgivable loans to small businesses for such expenses as making payroll payments to remain afloat. Federal programs also expanded unemployment insurance (UI) eligibility and increased unemployment benefits during the pandemic to assist those who lost their jobs or were otherwise unable to work through no fault of their own.
Rosenberg and his co-conspirators prepared and submitted at least 16 fraudulent PPP loan applications for businesses or purported businesses. In the applications, Rosenberg and his co-conspirators grossly inflated employee numbers and monthly payroll costs. They also created and submitted false tax returns and fake bank statements in support of the applications.
After the financial institutions approved and funded the loan applications, the business owners would share the loan proceeds with Rosenberg and his co-conspirators. During this time, Rosenberg and a co-conspirator controlled various shell companies to which the business owners often would transfer a percentage of the PPP loan proceeds. The payout of these fraudulent PPP loans and the wire fraud conspiracy caused a total loss of at least $9.3 million, of which Rosenberg received at least $1,666,290.
Rosenberg and his co-conspirators also submitted fraudulent UI applications using other individuals' personal identifying information (PII) that they obtained online. The benefits were issued on prepaid debit cards mailed to addresses the conspirators listed on the applications. Along with individuals' PII, the conspirators included false information in the applications and certifications, including false employment and wage history as well as false contact information. Rosenberg applied for and received over $110,308 in UI and pandemic unemployment assistance benefits.
Rosenberg also possessed device-making equipment in his residence, including equipment to create fraudulent documents, black check paper, card stock for IDs, holograms used for passports and driver licenses, at least six fraudulent Social Security cards, and at least eight fake driver licenses. Rosenberg made at least two fake Burkina Faso passports and at least one unauthorized United States passport.

Former Ericson State Bank President Sentenced for Bank Fraud,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/former-ericson-state-bank-president-sentenced-bank-fraud,"August 1, 2024",2024,"United States Attorney Susan Lehr announced that Jackie Poulsen, aka Jack Poulsen, 71, of Ericson, Nebraska, was sentenced on August 1, 2024, in federal court in Lincoln, Nebraska for bank fraud. United States District Judge Susan M. Bazis sentenced Poulsen to 18 months’ imprisonment with 5 years of supervised release to follow. There is no parole in the federal system. Poulsen was additionally ordered to pay a $815,000 in restitution.
Poulsen was the President of Ericson State Bank (ESB) from June of 2010 until September of 2019. He was additionally on the Board of Directors for the bank. In his role as President of ESB, he was responsible for overseeing all ESB’s affairs and managing ESB’s day-to-day operations. ESB, like any other bank in Nebraska, had to undergo regular examinations conducted by the Nebraska Department of Banking and Finance (NDBF). One such examination occurred in October of 2017, which ESB passed. The next examination occurred in April of 2019. The 2019 examination revealed that ESB’s condition had significantly deteriorated since the 2017 examination. NDBF indicated in a report that this deterioration was “due in large part to [ESB] being operated without regard for laws, regulations, prudent banking policies, and practices.”
During the investigation that followed the 2019 examination, the NDBF discovered that there were significant violations of the Nebraska statutory lending limits and that Poulsen had personally made, or was directly responsible for, many of the loans, lines of credit, and coverups of overdrafts that were in violation of the law, and which were adversely affecting the safety and soundness of ESB. A substantial number of the violations involved accounts and loans held by a relative of Poulsen’s and the relative’s business-related entities. NDBF examiners determined that a specific loan to Poulsen’s relative had been continuously more than the statutory lending limit since November 2017, or approximately one month after the 2017 Examination. NDBF examiners further determined that since May 29, 2019, Poulsen made multiple advances to the relative and charged off a portion of the borrowings without completing the appropriate paperwork or seeking approval from the Board or loan committee.
NDBF examiners discovered that some lending limit violations had substantially increased in size through increases in operating lines of credit, additional advances, and/or payment of overdrafts since the May 29, 2019, meeting. NDBF examiners determined that as of August 26, 2019, maturity dates on loans had been extended multiple times without formal documentation; borrowers’ financial information was inadequate; collateral for loans was either non-existent or poorly documented and managed, and deposit accounts, including those held by his relative, were frequently and substantially overdrawn. Poulsen’s scheme to defraud continued until September of 2019, when Poulsen was removed from his positions of authority with ESB based on NDBF’s findings. Poulsen’s license was also revoked.
As of December 31, 2019, ESB had total assets of approximately $110,879,000. However, on February 14, 2020, NDBF closed ESB and appointed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), as liquidator and receiver of ESB. Mark Quandahl, NDBF Director issued a statement regarding the failure of ESB which stated, “The failure of Ericson State Bank resulted primarily from large out-of-territory commercial loan losses and poor management practices which led to a deterioration of the bank’s capital. When the capital was not replenished the Department was left with no option but to place the insolvent institution into receivership.”
The FDIC entered into a purchase and assumption agreement with Farmers and Merchants Bank, Milford, NE, in which the purchasing bank assumed all customer deposits of ESB. At the time of ESB’s failure, ESB was a state chartered financial institution regulated and examined by the NDBF and it was determined that a loss of $815,000 was attributable to the insider-related loans which were subject to Poulsen’s scheme.
The investigation and subsequent prosecution of this matter was the result of the work of multiple agencies in conjunction with the United States Attorney’s Office for the District od Nebraska. Following today’s sentencing the following comments were made:
“The people of Nebraska expect their monies to be safe when they choose to place their trust in local banks.” Said United States Attorney Susan T. Lehr. “No bank officials should be permitted to abuse that trust for the sake of their and their family’s personal gain. The United States Attorney’s Office thanks all law enforcement agencies who worked diligently on the thorough investigation of this case.”
FBI Omaha Special Agent in Charge Eugene Kowel said, “Not only did Jack Poulsen’s financial scheme of insider-related loans lead to his sentence to federal prison, it also led to the collapse of a bank that had served rural Nebraska for 60 years. The FBI is committed to working with our federal, state, and local partners to hold accountable those who exploit their positions of trust to defraud financial institutions.”
“Jack Poulsen exploited his position as a bank executive to commit fraud that ultimately led to Ericson State Bank’s failure,” said Jon Ellwanger, Special Agent in Charge, Western Region, Office of Inspector General for the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. “His sentencing sends a clear message that bank executives who commit fraud will be brought to justice for their actions. We are proud to have worked with our federal law enforcement partners and the U.S. Attorney’s Office to hold Mr. Poulsen accountable for his crimes.”
“As both bank president and board member, the defendant had a duty to conduct business honestly but instead abused that trust and committed insider fraud, contributing to the failure of a bank that had been part of the Federal Home Loan Bank System for more than 60 years,” said Korey Brinkman, Special-Agent-in-Charge of FHFA-OIG’s Midwest Region. “We will continue to vigorously investigate criminal offenses involving frauds that impact the integrity, safety, and soundness of Federal Home Loan Banks and member banks. We are proud to partner with our colleagues and the United States Attorney’s Office with this investigation.”
“Today's sentencing holds the defendant accountable for defrauding Ericson State Bank by misusing his position as president of the bank to conceal the true financial condition of these loans from the institution and its Board of Directors,” said Special Agent in Charge Justin R. Bundy of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC OIG), Kansas City Region. “The FDIC OIG will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to bring to justice bank insiders who violate their positions of trust and commit fraudulent acts that threaten to undermine the integrity of our Nation’s financial institutions.”
This case was investigated by the Federal Housing Finance Agency – Office of Inspector General, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation – Office of Inspector General, Federal Reserve Board – Office of Inspector General, and the Federal Bureau of Investigations.

Canadian Man Pleads Guilty in Scheme to Steal Millions of Dollars from Bank Accounts of Thousands of Victims in the United States,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/canadian-man-pleads-guilty-scheme-steal-millions-dollars-bank,"July 30, 2024",2024,"A Canadian man pleaded guilty yesterday in federal court in Las Vegas to conspiracy to commit wire fraud and money laundering in connection with a scheme to steal millions of dollars from thousands of victims in the United States.
According to court documents, Poupak Jannissar, 52, of Quebec, Canada, operated and controlled sham companies that used fake checks and other fraudulent debits to steal from victims’ accounts at banks in the United States. The defendant and his co-conspirators used various names for the sham companies, including Computer Run, EBooks, Joreeb, Memo Storage, Our Online Backup, You Can Fax Too and Your E-Library. These companies pretended to sell various internet-based services for consumers, such as cloud storage, internet faxing and online books. However, the sham companies did not actually provide any real products or services. Instead, the sham companies served to conceal the theft of money from bank accounts by Jannissar and his co-conspirators.
According to court documents, Jannissar and his co-conspirators bought lists containing misappropriated personal information belonging to thousands of potential victims. Jannissar and his co-conspirators then falsely represented to banks and others that individual victims had authorized debits from their bank accounts. If the individual victims did not notice and dispute initial charges made by the sham companies, the sham companies would fraudulently debit bank accounts multiple times. Jannissar and his co-conspirators transferred money they stole to accounts in Canada.
Jannissar pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and one count of money laundering in front of U.S. District Judge Andrew P. Gordon of the U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada.
Jannissar was arrested on Jan. 22, at the Fort Lauderdale–Hollywood International Airport in Florida based on a criminal complaint and arrest warrant issued in the District of Nevada by U.S. Magistrate Judge Brenda Weksler. He was subsequently indicted on the charges to which he pled guilty today.
“Through various sham entities, the defendant and his accomplices stole consumers’ hard-earned money directly from their bank accounts,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton, head of the Justice Department’s Civil Division. “The Justice Department will use all of the tools at its disposal to apprehend and prosecute criminals, whether located inside or outside the United States, who steal from Americans.”
“Today’s guilty plea demonstrates our commitment to finding and prosecuting individuals who steal from consumers,” said U.S. Attorney Jason M. Frierson for the District of Nevada. “Defrauding consumers and stealing their hard-earned dollars is a crime against the individuals but it also violates the trust we have in free commerce. With our law enforcement partners, we are committed to holding accountable those who violate federal law. We thank our partners for their investigative efforts to help bring justice for victims.”
“Mr. Jannisar and his co-conspirators used sham companies to steal from unknowing victims by accessing their bank accounts using personal identifiable information from illegally obtained lists, and sadly nothing more than a keystroke on a computer,” said Inspector in Charge Eric Shen of U.S. Postal Inspection Service Criminal Investigations (USPIS-CI). “His actions and those of his co-conspirators represent a crime of greed and opportunity but will not go unpunished thanks to the law enforcement community, who have dedicated their mission to uncovering and putting an end to devious schemes like these.”
""The defendant's guilty plea holds him accountable for perpetrating a fraudulent scheme that stole funds from thousands of victims' bank accounts,” said Special Agent in Charge Vincent R. Zehme of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC OIG) Chicago Regional Office. “The FDIC OIG continues to work closely with our law enforcement partners to pursue those who cause financial harm to consumers and threaten to undermine the integrity of our Nation's banking system.""
Jannissar faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison per charge. A federal district judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.
USPIS-CI and FDIC OIG are investigating the case. U.S. Customs and Border Protection provided valuable assistance.
Senior Trial Attorney Daniel Zytnick of the Civil Division’s Consumer Protection Branch and Assistant U.S. Attorney Richard Anthony Lopez for the District of Nevada are prosecuting the case.

"Two Illinois Men Sentenced for Conspiracy to Commit Bank Fraud, Bank Fraud, and Money Laundering",https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/two-illinois-men-sentenced-conspiracy-commit-bank-fraud-bank,"July 25, 2024",2024,"ROCK ISLAND, Ill. – Two Illinois men – Erik Richard Jones, 46, and Mitchell Allen Melega, 38 – were sentenced on July 23, 2024, to multi-year prison sentences following their convictions for conspiracy to commit bank fraud, bank fraud, and money laundering. Jones, of Colona, Illinois, was sentenced to 54 months of imprisonment to be followed by five years of supervised release, and Melega, formerly of Orion, Illinois, was sentenced to 75 months of imprisonment to be followed by five years of supervised release. Both defendants were also ordered to pay $4,840,944.63 in restitution.
At the sentencing hearing in front of U.S. District Judge James E. Shadid, the government presented evidence that between 2016 and 2017 Jones and Melega devised and executed a scheme to provide false documents to First Midwest Bank in Moline, Illinois, to induce the bank to provide loans to Colona-based I-80 Equipment for vehicle purchases and improvements. Jones, the owner of I-80 Equipment, and Melega, the controller, then diverted loaned funds to other unauthorized uses and directed other employees of the business to provide false information in support of the conspiracy and scheme to defraud. In addition, they diverted real estate loan proceeds advanced by Northwest Bank in Davenport, Iowa – which were intended to finance renovations to an apartment complex Jones purchased – to other uses, including paying off an unrelated loan for Jones’s family members and unrelated business expenses of I-80 Equipment.
Also at the sentencing hearing, Judge Shadid found the scheme – which involved both altering legitimate documents and completely fabricating false documents, included at least 110 vehicle purchases, and took place over an extended period of time – was particularly sophisticated.
Both men were charged in October 2020 in a twelve-count indictment. The charges were conspiracy to commit bank fraud, (Count 1); bank fraud (Counts 2 through 9); and money laundering (Counts 10 through 12). Jones pleaded guilty in September 2023 to all counts of the indictment, and Melega pleaded guilty in March 2024 to the same charges.
The statutory penalty for conspiracy to commit bank fraud is up to 30 years of imprisonment per count; for bank fraud the statutory penalty is up to 30 years of imprisonment per count; and for money laundering the statutory penalty is up to ten years of imprisonment per count.
“Our office is dedicated to prosecuting these serious financial crimes,” said U.S. Attorney Gregory K. Harris. “Actions like the defendants’ cause significant harm to banks and undermine the stability of our financial system. We are grateful to our federal and local law enforcement partners for their commitment to these investigations and cases.”
“The defendants in this case have been brought to justice for defrauding First Midwest Bank and using the obtained funds for unauthorized purposes,” said Special Agent in Charge Vincent R. Zehme, of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC OIG), Chicago Region. “The FDIC OIG will continue working with our law enforcement partners to hold individuals accountable who commit such fraudulent offenses and threaten to undermine the integrity of our Nation's banks.”
“This sentence should serve as a warning to any potential fraudsters who think they can defraud banks and get away with it,” said IRS Criminal Investigation (CI) Special Agent in Charge Thomas F. Murdock.  “The collective efforts of IRS CI, the FDIC-OIG, and the U.S. Attorney’s Office can follow the money trail and ensure those who engage in bank fraud and money laundering are vigorously investigated and brought to justice.”
“The FBI, working with our federal and state partners, will vigorously investigate to uncover the truth and deliver accountability anytime anyone defrauds U.S. banks,” said Special Agent in Charge Christopher Johnson. “The FBI remains committed to safeguarding our economic security from threats which could cause harm to American institutions.”
The Internal Revenue Service, Criminal Investigation Division; the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of Inspector General; the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Springfield Field Office; and the Illinois Secretary of State Police investigated the case. Assistant U.S. Attorneys John Mehochko and Jennifer Mathew represented the government in the prosecution.

Florida Man Sentenced to Three Years in Prison for Fraudulently Obtaining $2.4 Million in CARES Act Loans,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/florida-man-sentenced-three-years-prison-fraudulently-obtaining,"July 25, 2024",2024,"TRENTON, N.J. – A Florida man was sentenced today to 36 months in prison for fraudulently obtaining over $2.4 million in federal Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans and Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) payments, U.S. Attorney Philip R. Sellinger announced.
Mohamed A. Awad, 61, of Ocala, Florida, pleaded guilty on Nov. 20, 2023, before Judge Michael A. Shipp to an information charging him with wire fraud and money laundering. Judge Shipp imposed the sentence today in Trenton federal court.
According to documents filed in this case and statements made in court:
The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act is a federal law enacted on March 29, 2020, designed to provide emergency financial assistance to the millions of Americans suffering the economic effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Awad engaged in a scheme to illegally obtain over $2.4 million in PPP and EIDL loans through numerous misrepresentations to lenders. He submitted fraudulent loan applications that fabricated numbers of employees and misrepresented company information, to induce PPP and EIDL lenders to approve the loan applications that they otherwise would not have approved. Awad submitted falsified tax documents in support of PPP applications. According to IRS records, none of the purported tax documents that Awad submitted in support of the loan applications were ever in fact filed with the IRS. Awad thereafter transferred the loan proceeds among various bank accounts he controlled, withdrawing significant amounts in cash and transferring loan proceeds out of the country via wire transfers to banks based in Egypt.
In addition to the prison term, Judge Shipp sentenced Awad to three years of supervised release and ordered restitution of $2.41 million and forfeiture of $1.49 million.

Sellinger announced today.
Lisa Smith, 61, of Cornelius, North Carolina, pleaded guilty before U.S. District Judge Karen M. Williams in Camden federal court on July 17, 2024, to an information charging her with one count of bank fraud conspiracy.
According to documents filed in these cases and statements made in court:
In early 2021, Smith submitted PPP loan applications for two companies that she controlled. The applications included fake bank statements and fake IRS tax forms, and significantly overstated the companies’ number of employees and payroll expenses. Smith obtained $125,000 in PPP loans based on these fraudulent applications. Smith and her conspirators recruited individuals who owned companies with little or no operations to apply for PPP loans. Smith helped the recruited individuals submit PPP loan applications that contained fake bank statements and fake IRS tax forms, and that contained materially false representations about the companies’ number of employees and payroll expenses. Based on these fraudulent PPP loan applications, more than 25 PPP loans totaling more than $3.5 million were approved and funded. Smith received a percentage of the loan proceeds as compensation for her role.
The count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud is punishable by a maximum of 30 years in prison and a $1 million fine. Sentencing is scheduled for Nov. 21, 2024.

Sweepstakes Operators Plead Guilty to Bank Secrecy Act Violations,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/sweepstakes-operators-plead-guilty-bank-secrecy-act-violations,"July 3, 2024",2024,"Two Missouri men pleaded guilty yesterday to conspiring with bankers to willfully fail to implement appropriate anti-money laundering (AML) controls at a Missouri bank, as required by the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA).
Kevin Brandes, 60, and William Graham, 56, both residents of Kansas City, Missouri, owned and operated multiple sweepstakes businesses and held accounts for those businesses at the Missouri bank. According to court documents, from 2013 to 2019, Brandes and Graham abetted bank officials in failing to implement key components of the bank’s AML program.
Under the BSA and its implementing regulations, the bank was required to file currency transaction reports (CTR) with the Department of the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) for any transaction in currency of more than $10,000. In 2017, at the request of bank officials, Brandes and Graham signed FinCEN CTR Exemption Review Forms that classified their companies as “direct mail advertising” businesses. After receiving the signed exemption forms, the bank failed to file CTRs with FinCEN on transactions involving Brandes’ and Graham’s businesses. Additionally, Brandes’ and Graham’s companies were deemed “high risk” and subject to heightened monitoring under the bank’s policies and procedures. Brandes and Graham understood that by signing the CTR exemption forms the bank would apply less scrutiny to their companies’ transactions.
Additionally, on or about Oct. 11, 2016, at the direction of two bank officials, Brandes and Graham had an outside attorney sign a legal opinion letter, then sent it to the bank, knowing that it contained false information. Specifically, the letter indicated that one of Brandes’ companies “in over 3 years has not received negative or unwanted legal action by way of regulatory bodies or private suits.” Brandes and Graham knew at the time, however, that this information was false because a state regulatory agency had filed a legal action against the company in question. Brandes and Graham both believed this letter would help the bank circumvent its requirements under the BSA.
Brandes and Graham each pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to cause the willful failure to implement and maintain an appropriate anti-money laundering program. Brandes and Graham will be sentenced at a later date and face maximum penalties of five years in prison. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.

Three Former Executives Sentenced for $1B Corporate Fraud Scheme,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/three-former-executives-sentenced-1b-corporate-fraud-scheme,"July 1, 2024",2024,"Three former executives of Outcome Health (Outcome), a Chicago-based health technology start-up company, were sentenced for their roles in a fraud scheme that targeted the company’s clients, lenders, and investors and involved approximately $1 billion in fraudulently obtained funds.
“Outcome’s former executives deceived their clients, their auditor, their lenders, and their investors for years,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri, head of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. “Their sentences should serve as yet another reminder that ‘faking it until you make it’ is not an acceptable practice for any business, whether that company is a technology start-up or a well-established corporation. Lying about your revenue to obtain customers or financing is fraud, plain and simple. The Criminal Division is committing to holding companies and their executives accountable for their misconduct.”
“The defendants’ vast scheme defrauded the clients, investors, and lenders who supported their business,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Morris Pasqual for the Northern District of Illinois. “Although they sought to hide the fraud by silencing whistleblowers and duping auditors, a jury rightly held the defendants accountable for their extensive fraud scheme. Our office will continue to work tirelessly with our law enforcement partners to deliver justice for the victims of complex fraud schemes.”
According to court documents and evidence presented at trial, Outcome, which was founded in 2006 and known as Context Media prior to January 2017, installed television screens and tablets in doctors’ offices across the United States and then sold advertising space on those devices to clients, most of which were pharmaceutical companies. Shah, Agarwal, and Purdy sold advertising inventory the company did not have to Outcome’s clients and then under-delivered on its advertising campaigns. Despite these under-deliveries, the company still invoiced its clients as if it had delivered in full. Shah, Agarwal, and Purdy lied or caused others to lie to conceal the under-deliveries from clients and make it appear as if the company was delivering advertising content to the number of screens in the clients’ contracts. Purdy and others at Outcome also inflated metrics that purported to show how frequently patients engaged with Outcome’s tablets installed in doctors’ offices. According to the trial evidence, the scheme targeting Outcome’s clients began in 2011 and lasted until 2017, and resulted in at least $45 million of overbilled advertising services.
“This was an elaborate, billion-dollar fraud scheme by three people who were supposed to be leaders of the company,” said Executive Assistant Director Timothy Langan of the FBI’s Criminal, Cyber, Response, and Services Branch. “Instead, these now former executives attempted to illegally line their own pockets. This type of fraud and abuse takes critical resources out of our health care system, and the FBI will always work with our law enforcement partners to investigate and prosecute anyone who intends to defraud the American public.”
Shah, Agarwal, and Purdy also defrauded Outcome’s lenders and investors. The under-delivery to Outcome’s advertising clients resulted in a material overstatement of Outcome’s revenue for the years 2015 and 2016. The company’s outside auditor signed off on the 2015 and 2016 revenue numbers because Purdy caused others to fabricate data to conceal the under-deliveries from the auditor. Shah, Agarwal, and Purdy then used the inflated revenue figures in Outcome’s 2015 and 2016 audited financial statements to raise $110 million in debt financing in April 2016, $375 million in debt financing in December 2016, and $487.5 million in equity financing in early 2017. The $110 million debt financing resulted in a $30.2 million dividend to Shah and a $7.5 million dividend to Agarwal, and the $487.5 million in equity financing resulted in a $225 million dividend that benefited Shah and Agarwal.
“The defendants in this case have been brought to justice for their actions in deceiving Outcome Health’s clients and fraudulently obtaining approximately $1 billion from its lenders and investors,” said Assistant Inspector General for Investigations Shimon R. Richmond of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC-OIG). “The FDIC-OIG will continue to work alongside our law enforcement partners to hold accountable individuals who harm lenders, investors, and clients by committing such fraudulent acts.""
A federal jury convicted Shah, Agarwal, and Purdy in April 2023. Shah was convicted of five counts of mail fraud, 10 counts of wire fraud, two counts of bank fraud, and two counts of money laundering. Agarwal was convicted of five counts of mail fraud, eight counts of wire fraud, and two counts of bank fraud. Purdy was convicted of five counts of mail fraud, five counts of wire fraud, two counts of bank fraud, and one count of false statements to a financial institution.
Three other former Outcome employees pleaded guilty prior to trial. Ashik Desai, the former chief growth officer, pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud. Kathryn Choi, a former senior analyst, and Oliver Han, a former analyst, both pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Desai will be sentenced on Sept. 20. Choi and Han will be sentenced on Oct. 4 and Oct. 11, respectively.
The FBI and FDIC-OIG investigated the case. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission provided assistance in the case.
Assistant Chief Kyle C. Hankey of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Jason Yonan, Corey Rubenstein, and William Hogan for the Northern District of Illinois prosecuted the case. Former Assistant Chief William E. Johnston of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section and former Assistant U.S. Attorneys Matthew F.

Pharmacy Owners Sentenced for $18M COVID-19 Health Care Fraud and Money Laundering Scheme,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/pharmacy-owners-sentenced-18m-covid-19-health-care-fraud-and,"June 24, 2024",2024,"Two pharmacy owners were sentenced for using New York-area pharmacies to submit millions of dollars in false and fraudulent claims to Medicare and then laundering the proceeds, including during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Peter Khaim, 44, of Forest Hills, New York, was sentenced today to eight years and one month in prison, and his brother and co-defendant, Arkadiy Khaimov, 41, also of Forest Hills, was sentenced on April 3 to six years in prison.
According to court documents, Khaim and Khaimov engaged in a complex money laundering conspiracy to launder the proceeds of a fraudulent health care scheme involving 16 New York-area pharmacies that they and their co-conspirators owned and controlled. Khaim, Khaimov, and their co-conspirators exploited the COVID-19 emergency for their own financial gain by using COVID-19-related “emergency override” billing codes to submit fraudulent claims for expensive cancer medications Targretin Gel 1% and Panretin Gel 0.1% that were not prescribed by physicians or dispensed to patients, and that were purportedly dispensed during periods when certain pharmacies were closed.
To conceal over $18 million of their criminal proceeds, Khaim, Khaimov, and their co-conspirators funneled money through several shell companies, including sham pharmacy wholesale companies designed to look like legitimate wholesalers. Khaim and Khaimov typically sent the funds from the pharmacy bank accounts they controlled to the sham wholesale companies. The funds were then typically sent to companies in China for distribution to individuals in Uzbekistan. The defendants then received a corresponding amount of cash from a co-conspirator, minus a commission. At other times, the fraudulent proceeds were sent from the sham wholesale companies to Khaim, Khaimov, their relatives, or their designees, in the form of certified cashier’s checks and cash. Khaim and Khaimov used the proceeds of the scheme to purchase real estate and other luxury items.
Khaim pleaded guilty on Nov. 3, 2022 to one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering.  Khaimov pleaded guilty on Nov. 16, 2022 to one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. At sentencing, Khaim was ordered to pay more than $18 million in restitution and to forfeit more than $2.7 million. Khaimov was ordered to pay more than $18 million in restitution and to forfeit more than $9.6 million.

Former Bank Senior Vice President Pleads Guilty to Bank Fraud,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/former-bank-senior-vice-president-pleads-guilty-bank-fraud,"June 20, 2024",2024,"OKLAHOMA CITY – JOHN PADILLA , 44, of Lawton, has pleaded guilty to bank fraud, announced U.S. Attorney Robert J. Troester.
On May 7, 2024, Padilla was charged by Information with bank fraud. According to the Information, between February 2013 and December 2019, Padilla served as senior vice president and commercial loan officer for a federally insured bank located in Lawton. During that time, Padilla executed a scheme in which he recruited borrowers to apply for loans, many of which were not creditworthy and were in fact Padilla’s friends and associates. Padilla told the borrowers he would use the loan proceeds to invest in his real estate ventures, and that he would pay the borrowers a percentage of the profit.
The Information further alleges that Padilla would use most of the loan proceeds to support his gambling habit, while also using proceeds to make payments toward prior loans issued as part of the scheme. In all, Padilla’s actions cost the bank more than $1,000,000.
On June 17, 2024, Padilla pleaded guilty, and admitted to recruiting an associate to apply for a loan, knowing the proceeds were for his own personal use. At sentencing, Padilla faces up to 30 years in federal prison and a fine of up to $1,000,000.

Former Vice President and Branch Manager of Popular Bank Convicted of Fraud and Money Laundering Charges,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/former-vice-president-and-branch-manager-popular-bank-convicted,"June 19, 2024",2024,"Defendant Led Scheme to Defraud Federal Emergency Financial Assistance Programs out of Millions of Dollars in Pandemic Aid
Anuli Okeke, the former vice president and manager of a New York branch of Popular Bank was convicted yesterday afternoon by a federal jury in Brooklyn of all four counts of an indictment charging her with conspiracy to commit bank and wire fraud, wire fraud, bank fraud and money laundering conspiracy.  The charges arose out of a scheme the defendant led to fraudulently obtain millions of dollars from the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) program during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.  The verdict followed a one-week trial before United States District Judge Frederic Block.  When sentenced, Okeke faces up to 30 years in prison.
Breon Peace, United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York; Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri, Head of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division; Gail S. Ennis, Inspector General for the Social Security Administration (SSA-OIG); James Smith, Assistant Director-in-Charge, Federal Bureau of Investigation New York Field Office (FBI); Patricia Tarasca, Special Agent-in-Charge, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General, New York Regional Office (FDIC OIG); Brian Tucker, Special Agent-in-Charge, Office of Inspector General for the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Eastern Region; and Amaleka McCall-Brathwaite, Special Agent-in-Charge, Office of the Inspector General of the U.S. Small Business Administration, Eastern Region Office (SBA-OIG), announced the verdict.
“While the global pandemic caused widespread economic and personal harm for so many, the defendant abused her trusted position at a bank to steal millions of dollars from programs designed to keep small businesses afloat and workers on payroll,” stated United States Attorney Peace.  “This verdict reaffirms that our Office and law enforcement partners continue to bring to justice those who took advantage of a global crisis to commit crimes.”
“The jury’s verdict confirms that Anuli Okeke’s actions were not only criminal but also exploitive, damaging the integrity of programs put in place to help those suffering during a time of national crisis. My office will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to investigate those who misuse the identities of others for their selfish devices,” stated SSA Inspector General Ennis.  “I commend our law enforcement partners for their outstanding work in this investigation and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for prosecuting this case and holding Ms. Okeke accountable for her crimes.”
“Today the defendant in this case was held accountable for abusing her position of trust as a banker to facilitate millions of dollars of fraudulent Paycheck Protection Program loans in exchange for kickbacks. The defendant used these stolen funds to enrich herself while small businesses were struggling during the pandemic,” stated FDIC-OIG Special Agent-in-Charge Tarasca.  “The FDIC OIG remains committed to working with our law enforcement partners to protect the Nation’s financial system and hold accountable those individuals, like Ms. Okeke, who steal benefits designated to help those in need.”
“Anuli Okeke used her position to defraud the federal government of pandemic relief funds for her own personal gain and will now pay the price for her crimes,” stated Special Agent-in-Charge Tucker, Office of Inspector General for the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  “We are proud to have worked with our federal law enforcement partners and the U.S. Attorney’s Office to hold Ms. Okeke accountable.”
“The abuse of critical resources, intended to support small businesses during a time of unprecedented need, will not be tolerated,” stated SBA-OIG Special Agent-in-Charge McCall-Braithwaite.  “Today’s verdict is a testament to our unwavering dedication to protecting the integrity of SBA’s programs. Our collaboration with the U.S. Attorney’s Office and our law enforcement partners is essential to ensuring that those who defraud the government are brought to justice and the taxpayer interest are protected.”
COVID-19 Relief Overview
The CARES Act was enacted to provide emergency financial assistance in connection with economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.  One source of relief provided by the CARES Act was the allocation of funds for the issuance of forgivable loans to small businesses for job retention and certain other expenses through the PPP.  The PPP allowed qualifying small businesses to receive unsecured loans on favorable terms, which they were required to use for specified expenses, including payroll costs, interest on mortgages, rent and utilities.  The PPP provided for forgiveness of the loan if recipient businesses spent the proceeds on these specified expenses within a limited time period and used a certain percentage for payroll costs.
Another source of relief provided by the CARES Act was the EIDL program, which provided low-interest financing to small businesses, renters and homeowners in regions affected by declared disasters.  Under the program, EIDL recipients were eligible to receive advances of up to $10,000 for small businesses within three days of applying for an EIDL (EIDL Advance).  The amount of an EIDL Advance was determined based on the number of employees working for the applicant.  The EIDL Advance did not have to be repaid.
Criminal Conduct
As proven at trial, Okeke, and her co-conspirators, both from within and outside the bank fabricated loan and tax documents and stole funds from the PPP and EIDL programs.  Despite knowing that the PPP and EIDL applications contained false statements, and helping applicants make those false statements, Okeke signed each PPP loan application on behalf of the bank and submitted them for approval.  Once the loan proceeds were disbursed to the borrowers, Okeke and her co-conspirators took kickbacks from the loan proceeds.  The defendant also submitted her own fraudulent EIDL loan that contained false information.  In addition, the defendant also took unauthorized commissions from legitimate PPP recipients.
As shown at trial, the defendant boasted about her earnings from the scheme.  In handwritten notes found at her desk at work, the defendant wrote “I am making more than enough money,” “money comes to me easily,” “I am grateful I make $15k every month,” and “I have an extra $5000 every month.”  Around the time of the scheme, the defendant’s bank accounts saw an influx of cash deposits.
Prior to the defendant’s conviction at trial, seven other co-conspirators pled guilty to wire and bank fraud conspiracy in connection with the defendant’s pandemic aid fraud conspiracy at the bank.
The government’s case is being handled by the Office’s International Narcotics and Money Laundering Section as well as the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section.  Assistant United States Attorneys Chand Edwards-Balfour and Adam Amir and Trial Attorney Jennifer Bilinkas are in charge of the prosecution, with assistance from Paralegal Specialists Samuel Ronchetti, Michaela Ausbrooks, and April Ward.

Former College Football Player Pleads Guilty to a Fraud Scheme Involving More than $1 Million in COVID-19 Unemployment Benefits,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/former-college-football-player-pleads-guilty-fraud-scheme,"June 17, 2024",2024,"LOS ANGELES – A former college football player and Orange County man pleaded guilty today to orchestrating a scheme that fraudulently sought more than $1 million and obtained more than $280,000 in pandemic unemployment benefits.
Abdul-Malik McClain, 24, most recently of Coto de Caza, pleaded guilty to one count of mail fraud.
“Instead of using his time at a major university to advance his athletic and academic life, this defendant took advantage of a public health emergency to fraudulently obtain government benefits,” said United States Attorney Martin Estrada. “My office will continue to vigorously prosecute individuals who used the recent pandemic for their own unlawful ends.”
“Mr. McLain squandered his gifts and opportunities only to defraud taxpayers whose hard-earned money was appropriated for deserving victims during the Covid era,” said Krysti Hawkins, the Acting Assistant Director in Charge of the FBI's Los Angeles Field Office. “The FBI will continue to work with our partners to identify those who leveraged the Covid pandemic to commit fraud and hold them accountable.”
According to his plea agreement, while a member of his university’s football team, McClain filed fraudulent claims for unemployment benefits and organized and assisted a group of other football players in filing fraudulent claims for unemployment benefits, including under the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) program established by Congress in response to COVID-19’s economic fallout. McClain and others filed the claims with the California Employment Development Department (EDD), the administrator of the state’s unemployment insurance (UI) benefit program. The claims contained false information about the claimants’ supposed prior employment, pandemic-related job loss, and job-seeking efforts in California.
The false statements in the UI applications led EDD to authorize Bank of America to mail debit cards addressed to the named claimants, often to addresses that McClain controlled, such that McClain (and not the named claimants) received the debit cards. Those debit cards were loaded with various amounts in fraudulently obtained benefits, ranging from a few hundred dollars to thousands of dollars in unemployment benefits, which the recipients of the debit cards, including in many instances McClain himself, used to make cash withdrawals at ATMs and to fund personal expenses. In some cases, McClain sought and obtained a cut of the fraudulently obtained benefits for helping others file fraudulent UI applications.
McClain’s and his co-schemers’ fraudulent applications sought at least $1,056,092 in UI benefits from EDD and led to receiving at least $283,063 in fraudulently obtained benefits.
United States District Judge Michael W. Fitzgerald scheduled a September 16 sentencing hearing, at which McClain will face a maximum sentence of 20 years in federal prison.
“Abdul-Malik McClain defrauded our nation’s unemployment insurance (UI) system by filing for UI benefits in the names of identity theft victims, while so many deserving people were suffering from pandemic-related economic challenges,” said Quentin Heiden, Special Agent in Charge, Western Region, United States Department of Labor Office of Inspector General. “The benefits were intended for those who truly needed it, not for greedy individuals who chose to exploit the system. The U.S. Department of Labor, Office of Inspector General remains dedicated to its mission to combat UI fraud. Our efforts to uncover fraudulent actors and their schemes is unwavering. I would also like to thank our state and federal law enforcement partners in Los Angeles in this collaborative investigative effort.”
The FBI; the United States Department of Labor Office of Inspector General; the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Office of Inspector General; the United States Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration; the Social Security Administration Office of Inspector General; and the United States Postal Inspection Service investigated this matter. The university, called “University 1” in the indictment, cooperated in this investigation.
Assistant United States Attorney Kerry L. Quinn of the Major Frauds Section is prosecuting this case.
On May 17, 2021, the Attorney General established the COVID-19 Fraud Enforcement Task Force to marshal the resources of the Department of Justice in partnership with agencies across government to enhance efforts to combat and prevent pandemic-related fraud. The Task Force bolsters efforts to investigate and prosecute the most culpable domestic and international criminal actors and assists agencies tasked with administering relief programs to prevent fraud by, among other methods, augmenting and incorporating existing coordination mechanisms, identifying resources and techniques to uncover fraudulent actors and their schemes, and sharing and harnessing information and insights gained from prior enforcement efforts.

Former Assistant City Attorney and Police Officer Sentenced in an Approximately $15M PPP Fraud Scheme,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/former-assistant-city-attorney-and-police-officer-sentenced,"June 7, 2024",2024,"ATLANTA – Shelitha Robertson, who formerly served as an Assistant City Attorney and police officer for the City of Atlanta, has been sentenced for fraudulently obtaining approximately $15 million in loans under the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), a federal stimulus program authorized as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.
“Motivated by greed, Robertson deceptively obtained funds that were designated to provide emergency financial relief to struggling small businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic,” said U.S. Attorney Ryan K. Buchanan. “We will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to investigate and prosecute criminals who stole pandemic relief funds.”
“Today the defendant in this case was held accountable for fraudulently obtaining millions of dollars through the Paycheck Protection Program and using those stolen funds to enrich herself, while small businesses were struggling during the pandemic,” said Kyle A. Myles, Special Agent in Charge of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of Inspector General, Atlanta Region. “The FDIC OIG remains committed to working with our law enforcement partners to pursue and bring to justice those who took advantage of such pandemic relief programs and threatened the integrity of our Nation’s financial institutions.”
“Scheming to divert vital funds from legitimate businesses that needed support during the pandemic undermines the integrity of SBA’s programs,” said SBA OIG’s Eastern Region Special Agent in Charge Amaleka McCall-Braithwaite. “Our office remains steadfast in pursuing those who exploit federal programs for personal gain. I would like to thank the US. Attorney’s Office and our law enforcement partners for their unwavering commitment to the pursuing justice in this case.”
“The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration will aggressively pursue individuals who commit fraud against the American taxpayer by making false claims to obtain Paycheck Protection Program loans intended for legitimate businesses who needed it to survive the pandemic,” stated Special Agent in Charge Mark H Morini, Jr. “We want to express our gratitude to our federal partners and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for their assistance in holding these individuals to account.”
According to U.S. Attorney Buchanan, the court documents and evidence presented at trial: Shelitha Robertson and other co-conspirators submitted PPP loan applications on behalf of four businesses that she owned and controlled. The loan applications falsely inflated the number of employees and average monthly payroll for each of the four businesses, resulting in larger PPP loans than Robertson would be legitimately entitled to obtain. Robertson and her co-conspirator, Chandra Norton, also submitted false tax documents to support the inflated statements in each loan application. Robertson used the loan proceeds to purchase luxury items, including a 10-carat diamond ring. She also transferred funds to Chandra Norton and family members.
Shelitha Robertson, 62, of Atlanta, Georgia, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Steven D. Grimberg to seven years, three months in prison to be followed by three years of supervised release. A jury convicted Robertson of one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, three counts of wire fraud, and one count of money laundering on December 19, 2023.
This case was investigated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC-OIG), the U.S. Small Business Administration Office of Inspector General (SBA-OIG), and Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA).
Assistant U.S. Attorneys Bernita B. Malloy and Trial Attorney Ariel Glasner of the Department of Justice Criminal Division’s Fraud Section prosecuted the case.
The Fraud Section leads the Criminal Division’s prosecution of fraud schemes that exploit the PPP.

"Former Senior Executive at Chinatown Bank Sentenced to 3 Years in Federal Prison for Embezzling More Than $700,000 From Employer",https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/former-senior-executive-chinatown-bank-sentenced-3-years-federal,"June 7, 2024",2024,"LOS ANGELES – The former chief financial officer at a bank in the Chinatown area of downtown Los Angeles was sentenced today to 36 months in federal prison for embezzling more than $700,000 of his employer’s funds.
Sammy Sims, 61, of West Covina, was sentenced by United States District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong, who also ordered him to pay $306,849 in restitution.
Sims pleaded guilty on February 22 to one count of bank fraud and admitted at that hearing and in court documents to stealing bank employees’ identities to open life insurance policies in their names to benefit his wife.
Chinatown-based Eastern International Bank hired Sims in September 2017 as the lender’s CFO. As a condition of his employment, Sims agreed that he would not use the bank’s confidential information for his personal benefit or for others. The bank’s policy also required Sims to promptly disclose any conflicts or appearances of conflict with the bank’s interests. Sims’s scheme to defraud his employer lasted from February 2018 until at least April 2021.
From August 2018 to October 2020, Sims wired $86,000 in bank funds to the United States Treasury and California Franchise Tax Board to make payments towards the personal federal and state income taxes for himself and his wife. Sims concealed these transactions by creating false entries in the bank’s general ledger that falsely represented that the payments were for the bank’s tax accounts.
In April 2019, Sims used approximately $14,161 in bank funds to a debt collection agency to help pay off a debt that he had incurred. Sims concealed this transaction by creating a false entry in the bank’s general ledger that falsely stated the payment was for data processing software.
From April 2019 to December 2020, Sims took approximately $113,264 in money belonging to the bank to pay the balances on his personal credit card. Sims hid these expenses in the bank’s general ledger by falsely labeling them as bank expenses. During this time, he also siphoned approximately $81,815 from the bank by using a bank credit card, meant for work purposes, for his personal expenses, including steak dinners and a trip to Las Vegas.
Sims, from February 2020 to April 2021, also lied to several bank employees by telling them they had to switch their bank-funded life insurance policies because of their age. What neither the employees nor the bank knew was these policies were obtained through Sims’s wife, a licensed life insurance broker who received a commission for each life policy she sold. For some employees, Sims obtained their personal identifying information without their consent and then used this information to purchase life insurance policies from his wife. Sims used a checking account belonging to the bank to wire approximately $311,608 of the bank’s money to several life insurance companies to partially pay for the premiums for these policies.
Later, when Sims was confronted about the life insurance policies opened using bank employees’ personal identifying information, he lied by saying the employees’ identities could have been stolen through a cybersecurity hack or by unauthorized disclosures by the bank’s personnel department. Sims resigned from the bank shortly after being confronted about the life insurance policies.
In total, Sims unlawfully took $737,849 of bank funds for his personal use and benefit.
The FBI and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General investigated this matter.

Pair arrested for extensive CARES Act fraud conspiracy,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/pair-arrested-extensive-cares-act-fraud-conspiracy,"June 6, 2024",2024,"HOUSTON – Two individuals are now in custody for allegedly conspiring to submit numerous fraudulent applications for small business loans through the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) Program provided through the Coronavirus Aid Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act, announced U.S. Attorney Alamdar S. Hamdani.
Authorities have arrested Shawn Nicholas Young, 41, Missouri City, and Trenikia Lashae Banks, 40, Houston. They will make their initial appearances before U.S. Magistrate Judge Richard Bennett at 2 p.m.
According to the 11-count indictment, Young and Banks devised a scheme to submit fraudulent PPP and EIDL applications to the Small Business Administration (SBA) and several banks authorized to approve and fund PPP loans the government backed. They allegedly submitted false tax documents, including fake personal and business tax returns, to support the loan applications.
The indictment alleges Young and Banks used the loan proceeds to make large cash withdrawals and to pay for unauthorized and non-business expenses such as residential mortgages, home improvement loans and the purchase of vehicles. Some of the money also went to Young as kickback payments for submitting fraudulent applications for the businesses Banks and others owned, according to the allegations.
If convicted, each faces up to 20 years imprisonment for conspiracy and wire fraud as well as a $250,000 maximum possible fine. The money laundering count carries a possible 10-year prison term and a fine of up to $250,000 or twice the value of the property involved in the transaction.
Homeland Security Investigations, Federal Housing Finance Agency – Office of Inspector General (OIG), Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, Small Business Administration – OIG and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation – OIG conducted the investigation with the assistance of Fort Bend County Sheriff’s Office. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Stephanie Bauman and Shirin Hakimzadeh are prosecuting the case.

Former Southern Pine Credit Union President Sentenced to Prison and Ordered to Pay Nearly $4.5 Million Restitution,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/former-southern-pine-credit-union-president-sentenced-prison-and,"May 31, 2024",2024,"VALDOSTA, Ga. – The former President of Southern Pine Credit Union in Valdosta was sentenced to serve four years in prison and pay back nearly $4.5 million in restitution after she admitted to a long-running multimillion-dollar bank loan and aggravated identity theft scheme.
Leah Lehman, 63, of Valdosta, was sentenced to serve a total of 48 months in prison (24 months per count, to be served consecutively) to be followed by two years of supervised release on May 30. In addition, Lehman was ordered to pay $4,491,253.97 in restitution to Southern Pine Credit Union. Lehman pleaded guilty to one count of bank fraud and one count of aggravated identity theft on Oct. 26, 2023.
Co-defendant Teresa Paulo, of Valdosta, pleaded guilty to one count of bank fraud and one count of aggravated identity theft on Nov. 2, 2023. Paulo faces a maximum of 30 years in prison for bank fraud, and a mandatory two years in prison in addition to any other prison term imposed for aggravated identity theft, to be followed by a maximum of five years of supervised release and a $1,000,000 fine. Sentencing is scheduled for July 11.
U.S. District Judge W. Louis Sands is presiding over this case. The defendants are not eligible for parole.
“Lehman chose greed and deception, abusing her trusted leadership role to steal millions of dollars at this credit union over the course of many years,” said U.S. Attorney Peter D. Leary. “Our office, alongside our law enforcement partners, take financial crimes seriously, and we will work to hold fraudsters accountable.”
“This sentencing is the direct result of a diligent investigation by hardworking FBI employees and our partners at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of Inspector General,” said Rich Bilson, Senior Supervisory Resident Agent of FBI Atlanta’s Valdosta office. “Lehman’s greed driven scheme stole hundreds of thousands of dollars and damaged the financial security of innocent victims. They will now be held accountable for their blatant misuse of the power of their positions.”
“The criminal behavior in this case represents the most egregious betrayal of trust by two of this institution’s leaders, resulting in years of ill-gotten gains for the defendants, all while violating the faith that SPCU’s members placed in them,” said Kyle A. Myles, Special Agent in Charge of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of Inspector General, Atlanta Region. “We are grateful to our regulatory and law enforcement partners in this case and will continue to vigorously investigate allegations of financial crime at FDIC-supervised institutions and in support of our fellow financial regulators.”
According to court documents, Lehman served as President of Southern Pine Credit Union (SPCU) in Valdosta from 1990 to 2020. Paolo was SPCU’s controller from Oct. 2011 to June 2020. The Credit Union’s members are employees of the local paper mill and their families. Lehman and Paolo were both authorized to originate all types of loans, were responsible for filing quarterly reports to the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) and had access to all SPCU employees’ usernames and passwords for all SPCU computers and software.
Lehman began her fraud in June 2003, when she created a share secured loan in a SPCU account using the name and social security number of a member without that individual’s knowledge. From Feb. 2012 to May 31, 2020, Lehman paid off the loan and rebooked it multiple times with additional advances. She would take the proceeds and put them in a joint share draft account she had with the individual, using the proceeds to pay for a boat, a hunting club share, personal expenses and gifts to family members. This loan was repaid in full. However, Lehman created another share secured loan in another individual’s name without their knowledge and would also pay off the loan and rebook it multiple times for personal spending. To conceal these activities, Lehman created false credit transactions using the names and passwords of SPCU employees. These transactions would advance the due date on the loans, which prevented these loans from appearing on quarterly call reports to the NCUA and allowed Lehman to defer or not make payment on these loans. Following these transactions, Lehman created debit entries to put the loans back on the accounts, which would often include interest accrued on the outstanding loans. She made additional fraudulent loan advances simultaneously with those entries to advance the loan dates. She reflected the loans as being paid off at the end of the quarter to prevent possible detection of artificial growth in the SPCU loan portfolio. In total, the drafts needed to pay off the loan balances at each quarter grew to $4,112,870.63, excluding payments and interest, as of May 31, 2020.
Paulo committed a similar fraud scheme to Lehman. In Oct. 2011, Paulo created a share secured loan in a SPCU account using the name and social security number of a member without that individual’s knowledge. From Nov. 2011 until May 29, 2020, Paulo took out additional advances on the loan as well as additional loans from the account. Paulo would transfer the loan proceeds into a joint account for personal spending purposes. She created another share secured account using the personal identity of another individual and would pay off the loan and rebook it multiple times with additional advances, using the proceeds for her own personal expenses or electronically transfer money into her family’s accounts. Paulo concealed her schemes as Lehman concealed hers: creating false credit transactions using the usernames and passwords of SPCU employees to simulate the payoff of the loans, which would advance the due date on the loans. Paulo also created debit entries using other people’s usernames and passwords to put the loans back on the accounts, which would often include interest accrued on the outstanding loans. The drafts needed to pay off the loan balances at each quarter grew to $1,233,201.77, excluding payments and interest, as of May 31, 2020. Paulo made $7,736.16 in legitimate payments to the loan balances.
The case was investigated by the FBI and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of Inspector General (FDIC OIG).

Bank Manager Admits Coordinating Multistate COVID-19 Relief Program Fraud Scheme; New York Man Admits Laundering Proceeds,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/bank-manager-admits-coordinating-multistate-covid-19-relief,"May 30, 2024",2024,"CAMDEN, N.J. – A former branch manager of a national financial institution today admitted using his position to organize a conspiracy to help individuals obtain at least 38 fraudulent Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans totaling approximately $5 million, U.S. Attorney Philip R. Sellinger announced today. U.S. Attorney Sellinger also announced that a New York man admitted laundering the proceeds of one of the fraudulent PPP loans.
Tommy Hawkins, 61, of Philadelphia, pleaded guilty before U.S. District Judge Karen M. Williams to one count of bank fraud conspiracy. Sieff Robert Sargeant, 44, of Island Park, New York, pleaded guilty before Judge Williams to one count of money laundering.
According to documents filed in these cases and statements made in court:
The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act is a federal law enacted in March 2020 and was designed to provide emergency financial assistance to the millions of Americans who are suffering the economic effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.  One source of relief provided by the CARES Act was the authorization of hundreds of billions of dollars in forgivable loans to small businesses for job retention and certain other expenses, through a program referred to as the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP).  To obtain a PPP loan, a qualifying small business was required to apply and provide information on its operations, including the number of employees and expenses.  In addition, businesses generally had to provide supporting documentation.
In 2020 and early 2021, Hawkins worked as the branch manager of the Conshohocken, Pennsylvania, branch of a national bank that was accepting Paycheck Protection Program (PPP)  loan applications. Hawkins worked with Eric Rivera, Lisa Smith, and others to recruit individuals who owned companies with little or no operations to open bank accounts at Hawkins’ branch and apply for PPP loans. Hawkins helped the recruited individuals submit PPP loan applications that contained materially false representations about the companies’ number of employees and payroll expenses. The applications also included false documentation, including tax forms. Based on these applications, Hawkins’ bank approved at least 38 PPP loans and disbursed approximately $5 million. Hawkins received incentive compensation through the bank for opening business bank accounts for the companies that received fraudulent PPP loans and also had an agreement with Rivera and Smith for them to pay Hawkins $5,000 of the loan proceeds for each PPP loan that Hawkins helped to obtain.
In April 2021, Sargeant’s business received a PPP loan based on a fraudulent application that was submitted through Hawkins’ branch. Sargeant then paid another individual, James Wessels, to create fake payroll checks. Sargeant distributed fake payroll checks to a friend, who cashed the checks and returned the majority of the cash to Sargeant. This was done to conceal that the proceeds actually were being spent on non-payroll expenses.
The count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud is punishable by a maximum of 30 years in prison and a $1 million fine. The count of money laundering is punishable by a maximum of 20 years in prison and a $500,000 fine, or twice the gross gain or loss from the offense, whichever is greatest. Hawkins’ sentencing is scheduled for Oct. 3, 2024;  Sargeant’s sentencing is scheduled for Oct. 2, 2024.
U.S. Attorney Sellinger credited special agents of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation – Office of the Inspector General, New York Region, under the direction of Special Agent-in-Charge Patricia Tarasca; special agents of the FBI’s South Jersey Resident Agency, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Wayne A. Jacobs in Philadelphia; special agents of the Social Security Administration, Office of the Inspector General, Boston-New York Field Division, under the direction of Acting Special Agent in Charge Bradley Parker; and special agents of the U.S. Department of Labor, Office of the Inspector General, New York Region, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Jonathan Mellone, with the investigation leading to the guilty pleas.

According to court documents, in October 2020, after his co-conspirators gained access to email exchanges between Company 1 and Company 2, Abdulafeez Oluwatoyin Adebiyi, 34, learned that Company 1 had recently issued invoices to Company 2 for over a million dollars for work Company 1 had already performed for Company 2.
Operating outside the United States, Adebiyi created a phony email account for the president of Company 1 by using a domain name that differed from Company 1’s domain by a single letter. While impersonating the president, Adebiyi sent messages to Company 2 falsely claiming that Company 1 had recently changed bank accounts and provided account and routing numbers for a recently created account controlled by Adebiyi and his co-conspirators.
After Company 2 issued a wire transfer of over a million dollars to what they believed was an account for Company 1, the co-conspirators distributed the money through various transactions, including purchases of cryptocurrency and cashier’s checks and additional wire transfers.
The United Kingdom extradited Adebiyi in October 2023.

Fmr. executive pleads guilty after losing bank’s $47.1 million in crypto scheme,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/fmr-executive-pleads-guilty-after-losing-banks-471-million,"May 23, 2024",2024,"WICHITA, KAN. – A Kansas man pleaded guilty to using his position as a bank executive to embezzle millions of dollars causing the bank to fail at a complete loss of equity for investors.
According to court documents, Shan Hanes, 52, of Elkhart pleaded guilty to one count of embezzlement by a bank officer.
Hanes previously served as chief executive officer (CEO) of Heartland Tri-State Bank (HTSB) in Elkhart, Kansas. From May 2023 to July 2023 Hanes initiated a series of 10 outgoing wire transfers totaling $47.1 million of Heartland’s funds to a cryptocurrency wallet. The funds were transferred to multiple cryptocurrency accounts controlled by unidentified third parties during the time HTSB was insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
“Shan Hanes is a liar and a master manipulator who caused Heartland Tri-State Bank to collapse. Even as he was squandering away tens of millions of dollars in cryptocurrency, Hanes orchestrated schemes to cover his tracks concerning the losses at the bank,” said U.S. Attorney Kate E. Brubacher. “Many victims will never fully recoup losses to their life savings and retirement funds, but at least we at the Department of Justice can see that Hanes is held criminally responsible for his actions.”
“Shan Hanes exploited his position as a bank executive to commit fraud and embezzle funds that ultimately led to Tri-State Bank’s failure,” said Jon Ellwanger, Special Agent in Charge, Western Region, Office of Inspector General for the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. “Today’s announcement demonstrates our commitment to bringing to justice bank executives who engage in illegal activities that undermine the public trust. I commend our agent and law enforcement partners for their diligent work that ultimately led to this outcome.”
Hanes is scheduled to be sentenced on August 8, 2024, and faces a maximum of 30 years in prison. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.

Ponte Vedra Beach Man Indicted For Fraud Scheme Involving COVID-19 Personal Protective Equipment,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/ponte-vedra-beach-man-indicted-fraud-scheme-involving-covid-19,"May 20, 2024",2024,"Jacksonville, Florida – United States Attorney Roger B. Handberg announces the return of an indictment charging James Elliott Davis II (35, Ponte Vedra Beach) with 16 counts of bank fraud, 12 counts of wire fraud, and 1 count of money laundering and theft of mail. If convicted, Davis faces up to 30 years in federal prison for each count of bank fraud, up to 20 years in prison for each count of wire fraud, up to 10 years in prison for the money laundering count, up to 5 years’ imprisonment on the theft of mail count, and payment of restitution to the victims he defrauded.
According to court documents, from March 2018 through 2022, Davis ran a purported medical supply company named Medisale, Inc. By using false representations, Davis enticed individuals and business entities to invest over $7 million in Medisale. He falsely represented to victim-investors that Medisale was making significant profits on the sale of COVID-19 Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). He claimed to have contact with CEOs at various hospitals and that Medisale had contracts with hospitals to sell large volumes of N95 masks and other PPE. As part of his sale’s pitch, Davis showed bank statement with large balances, claiming the money was from the sale of PPE.
In reality, Medisale had no such contracts and had no true revenue from the sale of PPE. Davis kited checks and conducted fraudulent ACH/wire transfers between multiple financial institutions to artificially inflate the apparent balances on his bank accounts. Utilizing victim-investor money, Davis paid off previous debts, paid other investors purported profits from the sale of PPE, and paid for personal expenses. This included Davis using victim-investor money to purchase a membership at a luxury club in Ponte Vedra Beach and spending more than $27,000 on custom clothing.

According to documents filed in this case and statements made in court:
In early 2020, Gomes worked as the branch manager of a New York-based branch of an international bank.

Gomes linked his personal phone number to the customer’s accounts and created a fraudulent email address containing the customer’s name, which he similarly linked to the customer’s accounts. Gomes also used the fraudulent email address to “correspond” with his official bank email address to make it appear that the customer was sending instructions to the bank. In March and April 2020, Gomes fraudulently transferred a total of $208,939 from the customer’s accounts to Gomes’ personal bank accounts at other financial institutions, to his personal investment account, and to pay his personal cell phone bill.  Gomes continued the scheme even after the customer died on April 5, 2020.

Calaveras County Man Sentenced for COVID-19 Paycheck Protection Program Fraud,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/calaveras-county-man-sentenced-covid-19-paycheck-protection,"May 13, 2024",2024,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. — Tracy Emery Smith, 42, of Valley Springs, was sentenced today to 37 months in prison and ordered to pay $901,035 in restitution for COVID-19 Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan fraud and money laundering, U.S. Attorney Phillip A. Talbert announced.
Congress created the PPP in March 2020, as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, to provide emergency financial support to the millions of Americans suffering economic hardship due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act authorized billions of dollars in forgivable loans to small businesses struggling to pay employees and other business expenses. When applying for PPP loans, borrowers were required to certify the truthfulness and accuracy of all information provided in their loan applications, including their number of employees and average monthly payroll.
“Smith’s bogus loan applications drained the PPP program of funds intended for actual businesses that were negatively impacted by the pandemic,” said U.S. Attorney Talbert. “The U.S. Attorney’s Office will continue to investigate and prosecute those who obtained PPP funds through fraud.”
“The FBI is proud to partner with our fellow agencies. Collaboration ensures a thorough investigation by leveraging the strengths and unique abilities of each agency,” said Special Agent in Charge Siddhartha Patel of the FBI Sacramento Field Office. “This case is an example of how federal agencies work together to protect taxpayer funded programs.”
“Tracy Smith fraudulently falsified Paycheck Protection Program loan applications and obtained funds designated to provide Americans financial relief during the COVID-19 pandemic under the CARES Act,” said IRS Criminal Investigation Acting Special Agent in Charge Michael Mosley of the Oakland Field Office. “Today’s sentencing reinforces that IRS Criminal Investigation special agents and investigative staff are following the money and targeting fraudsters who seek to exploit the government’s relief efforts for their personal gain.”
“Mr. Smith created ghost employees and falsified loan applications in order to fraudulently obtain PPP loan proceeds earmarked to help struggling businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic. Mr. Smith’s actions not only defrauded the PPP Loan Program, but also disadvantaged business owners who were actually entitled to the benefits,” said Special Agent in Charge Ryan L. Korner from the San Francisco Regional Office of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC OIG). “The FDIC OIG is committed to working alongside our law enforcement partners to protect the Nation’s financial system and hold accountable those individuals, like Mr. Smith, who steal benefits designated to help those in need.”
“Tracy Smith defrauded the federal government of pandemic relief funds for his own personal gain and will now pay the price for his crimes,” said Jon Ellwanger, Special Agent in Charge, Western Region, Office of Inspector General for the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. “We are proud to have worked with our federal law enforcement partners and the U.S. Attorney’s Office to hold Mr. Smith accountable.”
According to court documents, in 2020, in order to receive PPP loans to which he was not entitled, Smith submitted loan applications for three companies containing false information such as the number of employees, the average monthly payroll for the company, and that he had not been involved in any bankruptcy.
Smith was listed as sole owner of Sharp Holding, and in the PPP loan application for that company, Smith claimed 27 employees with an average monthly payroll of $105,791. He certified that he was not involved in a bankruptcy when, in fact, his bankruptcy was pending at the time of the application. Smith received PPP loan proceeds of $220,600.
According to court documents, Smith submitted similar false loan applications for Real Fund 360 and Sharp Investor, receiving $452,800 and $242,000 respectively. As with Sharp Holdings, neither company had employees or a payroll.
This case was the product of an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the IRS Criminal Investigation, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General, and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Office of Inspector General. Assistant U.S. Attorney Roger Yang prosecuted the case.
This effort is part of a California COVID-19 Fraud Enforcement Strike Force operation, one of five interagency COVID-19 fraud strike force teams established by the U.S. Department of Justice. The California Strike Force combines law enforcement and prosecutorial resources in the Eastern and Central Districts of California and focuses on large-scale, multistate pandemic relief fraud perpetrated by criminal organizations and transnational actors. The strike forces use prosecutor-led and data analyst-driven teams to identify and bring to justice those who stole pandemic relief funds.

"Kingdom City Business Owner Sentenced for $673,000 CARES Act Fraud",https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/kingdom-city-business-owner-sentenced-673000-cares-act-fraud,"May 13, 2024",2024,"JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. – A Kingdom City, Mo., business owner was sentenced in federal court today for fraudulently receiving more than $673,000 in loans for several businesses under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.
Scott Allen Maples, 40, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Brian C. Wimes to 18 months in federal prison without parole. The court also ordered Maples to pay $684,034 in restitution to the Small Business Administration.
On Feb. 7, 2023, Maples pleaded guilty to one count of bank fraud. Maples admitted that he fraudulently applied for and received Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans for several businesses. When Maples applied for PPP loans, he reported exaggerated and inaccurate payroll expenses and submitted fabricated and altered bank statements and tax forms. Under the CARES Act, both the principal and interest on those loans were eligible for forgiveness if the loan money was spent for permissible expenses (such as payroll, mortgage interest, rent and utilities) and a requisite portion of the loan went towards payroll expenses.
After submitting five fraudulent loan applications, Maples received a total of $673,127.04 in loan proceeds.
Maples admitted that he submitted a loan application to Square, Inc., a company authorized to issue PPP loans, on May 6, 2020, on behalf of Area 23, LLC, claiming 21 employees and an average monthly payroll of $69,548. Maples submitted fabricated documents to support the loan application. He received a $173,872 loan. Maples also submitted a loan application to US Bank on May 15, 2020, for the same business, Area 23, making the same claims of employees and payroll and again including fabricated documents to support the loan application. Maples again received a $173,872 loan.
Maples also received a $51,750 PPP loan for Maples Enterprises through Square. In the loan application, Maples indicated that there were six employees earning a total of $20,700 per month on average. In reality, Department of Labor records reflected that there was only one employee earning $182.50 in the first quarter of 2019. Another business, Clearance Depot, received a $270,632 PPP loan. Maples submitted statements in support of this loan that were later found to be altered and incorrect.
Maples also submitted an application for an Economic Injury Disaster Loan seeking $30,000. This loan also contained suspected misrepresentations that overstated the prior year’s revenues. Maples received a $3,000 advance on this loan, but the loan that he sought was not issued.
This case was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Lauren E. Kummerer. It was investigated by the Small Business Administration Office of Inspector General, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, the FDIC Office of Inspector General, and IRS-Criminal Investigation.

“Tracy Smith fraudulently falsified Paycheck Protection Program loan applications and obtained funds designated to provide Americans financial relief during the COVID-19 pandemic under the CARES Act,” said IRS Criminal Investigation Acting Special Agent in Charge Michael Mosley of the Oakland Field Office. “Today’s sentencing reinforces that IRS Criminal Investigation special agents and investigative staff are following the money and targeting fraudsters who seek to exploit the government’s relief efforts for their personal gain.”
“Mr. Smith created ghost employees and falsified loan applications in order to fraudulently obtain PPP loan proceeds earmarked to help struggling businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic. Mr. Smith’s actions not only defrauded the PPP Loan Program, but also disadvantaged business owners who were actually entitled to the benefits,” said Special Agent in Charge Ryan L. Korner from the San Francisco Regional Office of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC OIG). “The FDIC OIG is committed to working alongside our law enforcement partners to protect the Nation’s financial system and hold accountable those individuals, like Mr. Smith, who steal benefits designated to help those in need.”
“Tracy Smith defrauded the federal government of pandemic relief funds for his own personal gain and will now pay the price for his crimes,” said Jon Ellwanger, Special Agent in Charge, Western Region, Office of Inspector General for the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. “We are proud to have worked with our federal law enforcement partners and the U.S. Attorney’s Office to hold Mr. Smith accountable.”
According to court documents, in 2020, in order to receive PPP loans to which he was not entitled, Smith submitted loan applications for three companies containing false information such as the number of employees, the average monthly payroll for the company, and that he had not been involved in any bankruptcy.
Smith was listed as sole owner of Sharp Holding, and in the PPP loan application for that company, Smith claimed 27 employees with an average monthly payroll of $105,791. He certified that he was not involved in a bankruptcy when, in fact, his bankruptcy was pending at the time of the application. Smith received PPP loan proceeds of $220,600.
According to court documents, Smith submitted similar false loan applications for Real Fund 360 and Sharp Investor, receiving $452,800 and $242,000 respectively. As with Sharp Holdings, neither company had employees or a payroll.
This case was the product of an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the IRS Criminal Investigation, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General, and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Office of Inspector General. Assistant U.S. Attorney Roger Yang prosecuted the case.
This effort is part of a California COVID-19 Fraud Enforcement Strike Force operation, one of five interagency COVID-19 fraud strike force teams established by the U.S. Department of Justice. The California Strike Force combines law enforcement and prosecutorial resources in the Eastern and Central Districts of California and focuses on large-scale, multistate pandemic relief fraud perpetrated by criminal organizations and transnational actors. The strike forces use prosecutor-led and data analyst-driven teams to identify and bring to justice those who stole pandemic relief funds.

Former Hawaii Resident Sentenced to 57 Months in Prison for Defrauding Investors of $1.2 Million,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/former-hawaii-resident-sentenced-57-months-prison-defrauding,"May 8, 2024",2024,"HONOLULU – Newton Kaleo DeLeon, 48, of San Juan Capistrano, California, was sentenced by Senior District Judge Helen Gillmor today to 57 months in prison and three years of supervised release for wire fraud and money laundering related to a scheme to defraud at least 42 Hawaii and California victim-investors out of more than $1.2 million. DeLeon, a former Big Island resident, is required to pay $1,246,850 in restitution to the victims of the scheme. He also must pay a forfeiture money judgment of $1,194,650.
According to information produced to the court, from at least 2017 to December 2020, DeLeon solicited money from victim-investors, many of whom were friends and teachers, by falsely representing that the money they provided him was for his flower lei business, “leiorders.com.” Instead, DeLeon spent the money on his personal expenses, including gambling and luxury items, such as a Chevrolet Tahoe. DeLeon falsely told victim-investors that he needed investment funds to purchase flowers and supplies for lei purchase orders that he had already executed with third parties, such as well-known casino hotels in Las Vegas, Nevada.
To further his scheme to defraud, DeLeon then falsely promised that he would repay the principal investment loan within a short time frame and split the profit with the investors as a return. DeLeon created and signed loan agreements and promissory notes for investors to create the false appearance of legitimate financial transactions upon which investors could rely.
To further legitimize his scheme to defraud, DeLeon provided investors with fictitious and fabricated purchase orders, contracts, and other documents that he created with unauthorized and false branded logos and forged signatures to make it appear he had large business lei orders with third parties, such as well-known casino hotels in Las Vegas, Nevada, when he knew that he did not secure these orders.
“Holding people like DeLeon accountable for criminally defrauding multiple victims in Hawaii and elsewhere is a top priority of our office,” said United States Attorney Clare E. Connors. “And while we will continue our law enforcement efforts to bring such perpetrators to justice, we encourage everyone to be their own first line of defense against those who create and then exploit relationships of trust.”
""The FBI hopes this sentence sends a message to those who try to take advantage and victimize investors in these types of schemes for their own personal greed,"" said FBI Special Agent in Charge Steven Merrill. “We urge the public to remain vigilant and thoroughly research any investment. As the saying goes, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.”
“Our communities here, along with people all over the world, value leis as symbols of hospitality, of honor, of friendship. DeLeon, however, only saw and valued his own greed,” said Special Agent in Charge Adam Jobes, IRS Criminal Investigation (CI), Seattle Field Office. “Financial crime is not victimless, and DeLeon deliberately chose to dishonor and hurt those in our communities with his actions. Today’s sentencing is a start to making things right, and CI is continually committed to bringing justice to those who do wrong.”
The FBI, IRS-Criminal Investigation, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General, and Orange County Sherriff’s Department conducted the investigation that led to the conviction. Assistant U.S. Attorney Rebecca Perlmutter handled the prosecution.

California Man & Companies Charged with Defrauding Central Illinois Investors,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/california-man-companies-charged-defrauding-central-illinois-0,"May 3, 2024",2024,"URBANA, Ill. – A federal grand jury returned an indictment on May 2, 2023, charging Brett Michael Bartlett, 37, of the 9000 block of Grackle Ave., Fountain Valley, California, and his companies, Dynasty Toys, Inc., and 7M E-group Corporation, with wire fraud, mail fraud, securities fraud, and money laundering.
The indictment alleges that Bartlett and his California-based companies, Dynasty Toys, and 7M E-group, devised a scheme to defraud investors and obtain their money by making materially false and fraudulent pretenses, representations, and promises. According to the indictment, Bartlett, thorough Dynasty Toys and 7M E-group, purchased items at liquidation sales and resold those items online, especially through Amazon. Bartlett solicited and accepted money from Central Illinois investors, first to purchase inventory to be resold by 7M E-group at promised annual returns of 20% to 40% and later to purchase Dynasty Toys’ preferred stock shares, which Bartlett claimed were expected to double in value.
According to the indictment, Bartlett induced investors to invest by dramatically overstating the success of the companies and the returns that the companies generated for investors, lying about the companies’ assets, failing to disclose the companies’ struggles even while continuing to solicit investments, and using investors’ funds for Bartlett’s own benefit. For example, Bartlett falsely told investors their existing shares were worth approximately $30 million in total, that Dynasty Toys owned hundreds of millions of dollars of gold assets, and that another company was going to purchase Dynasty Toys for $120 million. As a result, approximately 1,000 individuals, including over 50 investors from Central Illinois, invested over $20 million with Bartlett, 7M E-group, and Dynasty Toys.
According to the indictment, in May of 2020, Bartlett mailed to Central Illinois investors checks totaling millions of dollars, but the checks bounced. The indictment alleges that investors lost approximately $22.5 million as a result of Bartlett’s and his companies’ fraud.
Bartlett, Dynasty Toys, and 7M E-group are scheduled to appear before United States Magistrate Judge Eric I. Long in Urbana, Illinois on June 1, 2023, at 2 p.m. for arraignment on the charges. A trial date will be set at that time.
If convicted, Bartlett faces a penalty of up to twenty years in prison on each fraud charge and a penalty of up to ten years in prison on the money laundering charge. Bartlett also faces a penalty of up to three years of supervised release on each charge. The charges also carry maximum fines of up to $6.25 million for Bartlett and up to $27.5 million for the corporations.
The charges are the result of an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Springfield Field Office, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation – Office of Inspector General. Supervisory Assistant U.S. Attorney Eugene L. Miller is representing the government in the prosecution.
In a parallel investigation, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed on the same date as the indictment a civil complaint against Bartlett, 7M E-group Corp., Dynasty Toys, Inc., and other defendants in the United States District Court in the Central District of California seeking a civil judgment against them.
Members of the public are reminded that an indictment is merely an accusation; the defendants are presumed innocent unless proven guilty.

Former Ericson State Bank President Pleads Guilty to Bank Fraud,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/former-ericson-state-bank-president-pleads-guilty-bank-fraud,"May 2, 2024",2024,"United States Attorney Susan Lehr announced today that Jack Poulsen, age 71, of Ericson, Nebraska, entered a plea of guilty to an Information alleging bank fraud in front of United States Magistrate Judge Jacqueline M. DeLuca. Judge DeLuca scheduled Poulsen’s sentencing hearing for August 1st, 2024, at 11:00 AM before United States District Judge Susan M. Bazis. Poulsen faces a maximum possible penalty of 30 years’ imprisonment, a fine of up to $1 million, and a mandatory special assessment of $100.
Ericson State Bank was a small rural bank founded in 1959 and had its sole location in Ericson, Nebraska. It was an insured member of the FDIC since June of 1960, until its closing in February of 2020. Poulsen was the President of Ericson State Bank from June of 2010 until September of 2019. He additionally sat on the Board of Directors.
As President of Ericson State Bank, Poulsen was responsible for overseeing all Ericson State Bank’s affairs and managing day-to-day operations. Poulsen was additionally responsible for keeping other Board of Directors informed of the bank’s financial condition. As President, Poulsen had lending authority but was required to seek approval from the bank’s loan committee for any loans exceeding $250,000. Poulsen was not allowed to be the loan officer on loans for which he would have a personal conflict of interest, including loans Ericson State Bank made to parties or entities related to Poulsen.
Beginning in 2012, Ericson State Bank began a lending relationship with an individual related to Poulsen. This individual and his business entities received numerous loans and opened several accounts with the bank. Pursuant to rules and regulations, Poulsen was not allowed to be the loan officer for these insider-related loans. Nevertheless, beginning at least in June of 2015, Poulsen began interfering with these insider-related loans and accounts for the purpose of hiding their unsoundness from the Board of Directors. These actions included advancing bank funds on insider-related loans more than the approved loan amounts; manipulating data contained in the bank’s computer system by advancing Payment Due Dates and Loan Maturity Dates to conceal the past-due status of the insider-related loans from the Board of Directors; advancing loans over the approved note amounts and applying the funds to conceal overdrafts on the insider-related checking accounts from the Board of Directors. Poulsen’s actions continued until September of 2019 when Poulsen was removed from his positions of authority with Ericson State Bank.
In one instance, in March 2019, Poulsen manipulated the maturity date and entered a new due date for one of the insider-related loans without proper authorization. Due to this manipulation, the loan was not presented as past-due to the Board of Directors despite the loan being mature for 181 days and drawn to a balance of approximately $1.6 million over the approved loan amount.
Ultimately, Ericson State Bank failed and was placed into a receivership with the FDIC. At the time of Ericson State Bank’s failure, Ericson State Bank was a state chartered financial institution regulated and examined by the Nebraska Department of Banking and Finance and it was determined that a loss of more than $800,000 was attributable to the insider-related loans which were subject to the above-described scheme.
This case was investigated by the Federal Housing Finance Agency – Office of Inspector General, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation – Office of Inspector General, Federal Reserve Board – Office of Inspector General, and the Federal Bureau of Investigations.

According to court documents, Andra Shirone Thompson, 47, of Silver Spring, joined a conspiracy to submit fraudulent applications for Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDLs) and Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans on behalf of companies he controlled, including Alpha Bravo Tango LLC., Senergy Consulting Group Inc., and Novus Ordo Seclorum LLC. As a result of the deceitful loan applications, Thompson fraudulently obtained $716,375. Thompson spent a portion of the proceeds on vehicles, including a 2014 Lamborghini Aventador, and on renovations to a home in North Carolina.
Thompson also joined a conspiracy to defraud equipment financing companies by submitting fraudulent invoices that falsely showed the sale of substantial quantities of computer servers and related equipment. Thompson and his co-conspirators caused borrowers to submit these invoices to lenders to support their applications for loans to purchase the items shown on the invoices. Once approved, the loan proceeds were deposited into accounts controlled by Thompson and his co-conspirators. Unbeknownst to the lenders, the sales evidenced by the invoices never occurred. Thompson and his co-conspirators typically “kicked back” a portion of the proceeds to the borrower who submitted the application and kept the rest for themselves. Thompson personally participated in three executions of this scheme that caused approximately $813,362 in fraudulently induced lending.
Thompson pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. He faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison on each count. A sentencing date has not yet been set. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.

Former FDIC attorney sentenced after sexually exploiting children for years,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/former-fdic-attorney-sentenced-after-sexually-exploiting,"April 30, 2024",2024,"ALEXANDRIA, Va. – A former Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) attorney was sentenced today to 20 years in prison for conspiring to sexually exploit numerous children.
According to court documents, from January 2018 to October 2021, Mark Black, 50, of Arlington, Virginia, was a member of two online groups dedicated to locating prepubescent girls online and convincing the girls to livestream themselves engaging in sexually explicit conduct. Black and his co-conspirators covertly recorded these livestreams and share the videos with each other.
In July 2019, Black induced a prepubescent minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct on a live-streaming application while screen-recording that activity. That same month, Black and a co-conspirator also groomed another prepubescent minor to engage in sexually explicit acts on a photo and video-sharing application. The co-conspirator surreptitiously shared access to girl’s live-video feed and recorded the sexual acts before sending them to Black.
Between July 2019 and March 2022, Black and the same co-conspirator were members of two additional groups dedicated to the sexual exploitation of children and the sharing of child sexual abuse material (CSAM). In January 2021, Black sent CSAM of a minor to one of the groups.
Black’s electronic devices were found to contain approximately 172,707 images of suspected CSAM. Of those files, over 1,300 depicted identified victims of his conduct.
Black was formerly the Arlington Aquatic Club (AAC) board president.
Black pleaded guilty in January to conspiracy to produce child pornography and coercion and enticement of a minor.

Sellinger announced today.
Jeremy Earley, 42, of Egg Harbor Township, New Jersey, and Lilburn, Georgia, pleaded guilty on June 1, 2023, before U.S. District Judge Karen M. Williams to an information charging him with one count of engaging in a monetary transaction in criminally derived property. Judge Williams imposed the sentence on April 29, 2024, in Camden federal court.
According to documents filed in this case and statements made in court:
In 2020 and 2021, two companies owned by Earley received loans totaling more than $1.3 million from the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), a federal program that provided forgivable loans to small businesses for job retention and certain other expenses. The loans were approved based on fraudulent applications submitted by another individual stating that the companies had dozens of employees and monthly payrolls of $145,000 and $382,400, respectively. The applications also contained forged tax forms. In fact, Earley’s businesses had no employees other than himself and paid minimal to no wages. After receiving the PPP loan proceeds, Earley wrote checks totaling nearly $400,000 to the individual who submitted the loan applications to compensate her for her role in submitting the fraudulent loan applications.  Earley also wired $85,000 of the proceeds out of a bank account he controlled after being advised by federal agents not to spend the money because it constituted proceeds of bank fraud.
In addition to the prison term, Judge Williams sentenced Earley to three years of supervised release.
Rhonda Thomas previously pleaded guilty to bank fraud conspiracy and money laundering and was sentenced to five years in prison.

Three Individuals Indicted in Multistate COVID-19 Relief Program Fraud Scheme,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/three-individuals-indicted-multistate-covid-19-relief-program,"April 17, 2024",2024,"CAMDEN, N.J. – Three individuals were indicted for their roles in fraudulently obtaining approximately $5 million of federal Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans and Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL) and for laundering the loan proceeds, U.S. Attorney Philip R. Sellinger announced today.
Eric Rivera, 42, of Norcross, Georgia, is charged with one count of bank fraud conspiracy, three counts of bank fraud, one count of wire fraud conspiracy, two counts of wire fraud, one count of money laundering conspiracy, and eight counts of money laundering.  Adrienne Ponzo, 49, of Bear, Delaware, is charged with one count of wire fraud conspiracy, two counts of wire fraud, one count of money laundering conspiracy, and two counts of money laundering.  James Wessels, 54, of Middletown, Delaware, is charged with one count of bank fraud conspiracy, three counts of bank fraud, and one count of money laundering conspiracy.  They were charged by complaint in July 2023.
According to the indictment:
The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act is a federal law enacted in March 2020 and was designed to provide emergency financial assistance to the millions of Americans who are suffering the economic effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. One source of relief provided by the CARES Act was the authorization of hundreds of billions of dollars in forgivable loans to small businesses for job retention and certain other expenses, through a program referred to as the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP).  The CARES Act also authorized the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) to provide Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDLs) of up to $2 million to eligible small businesses that were experiencing substantial financial disruption due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
To obtain a PPP or EIDL loan, a qualifying small business was required to apply and  provide information on its operations, including the number of employees and revenues or expenses. Businesses generally had to provide supporting documentation such as tax returns and bank statements.
Rivera conspired with Wessels and others to defraud a participating lender in the PPP program. Rivera submitted fraudulent PPP loan applications for two companies he controlled, which included fake bank statements and IRS tax forms. The lender approved the PPP loans and paid Rivera’s companies $285,000. Rivera also recruited individuals who owned businesses with little or no operations and introduced them to a conspirator who prepared fraudulent PPP loan applications for these companies. Most of these PPP loan applications also included fake bank statements and tax forms. After the lender approved the PPP loans, Rivera received payments of 15 percent to 50 percent of the loan proceeds, via wire transfer or check, for his role in orchestrating this scheme. Wessels created fraudulent IRS tax forms for the PPP loan applications for Rivera’s companies and for the other companies for which Rivera was paid.  Wessels was paid a fee for each fraudulent tax form he created.
Wessels also conspired with two individuals who received fraudulent PPP loans from the lender to structure the spending of the PPP loan proceeds to conceal that the proceeds actually were being spent on non-payroll expenses. Wessels created fake payroll checks from the companies and the business owners distributed the fake payroll checks to friends and family members, who cashed the checks and returned the majority of the cash to the business owners.  The lender subsequently forgave these PPP loans based on forgiveness applications that falsely stated that most of the loan proceeds were spent on payroll expenses.
Rivera also conspired with Ponzo and others to defraud the SBA. After the CARES Act was passed, Rivera recruited individuals who owned companies with little or no operations and introduced them to Ponzo, who prepared fraudulent EIDL applications for these businesses and caused them to be electronically submitted to the SBA. Ponzo prepared fraudulent bank statements and tax returns for companies that did not have them. After the SBA approved the EIDL loans, Rivera received payments of 15 to 50 percent of the loan proceeds, via wire transfer or check, for his role in orchestrating this scheme. Rivera, in turn, wired a portion of the loan proceeds to Ponzo for her role in the scheme.

Brockton Man Sentenced for Fraudulently Obtaining More Than $1.5 Million in COVID-Relief Funds,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/brockton-man-sentenced-fraudulently-obtaining-more-15-million,"April 10, 2024",2024,"BOSTON – A Brockton man was sentenced yesterday in federal court in Boston for a scheme to submit false applications to obtain Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) and Economic Injury Disaster Loan Program (EIDL) funds through the Small Business Administration (SBA) that were made available under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.
Joao Mendes, 60, was sentenced by U.S. District Court Judge Nathaniel M. Gorton to 27 months in prison, followed by one year of supervised release. Mendes was also ordered to pay restitution in the amount of $1,542,759 and the forfeiture of assets totaling $1,751,694. In December 2023, Mendes pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud.
Beginning in or around June 2020 and continuing until at least in or around September 2020, Mendes submitted fraudulent PPP and EIDL loan applications on behalf of several companies, many of which were defunct. Mendes submitted multiple applications for a single entity to successive lenders until a loan was ultimately approved. Those applications contained conflicting information. The fraudulent PPP loan applications misrepresented the number of employees and the average monthly payroll expenses of Mendes’s various fictious businesses. Mendes also submitted false tax records in support of his loan applications. In his EIDL applications, Mendes misrepresented the number of employees, gross revenues and costs of goods sold for each business. Based on the fraudulent applications, Mendes and two of his relatives received over $1.5 million in PPP and EIDL funds. Once Mendes received the funds, he spent them for his own personal benefit—including for the purchase of cryptocurrency.
The United States seized cryptocurrency and fiat currency from over 20 accounts that, with additional funds turned over by Mendes, resulted in the recovery of $1.545 million in cryptocurrency and more than $206,000 in U.S. currency, which will be criminally forfeited.
The CARES Act is a federal law enacted on March 29, 2020, designed to provide emergency financial assistance to the millions of Americans who are suffering the economic effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. One source of relief provided by the CARES Act was the authorization of forgivable loans to small businesses for job retention and certain approved expenses, through the PPP. Another is the EIDL, through which the SBA offers loans that can only be used on certain permissible business expenses, which can include payment of fixed business debts, payroll, accounts payable, and other business-related expenses that could have been paid had the COVID-19 disaster not occurred. The American Rescue Plan Act established the Restaurant Revitalization Fund (RRF) to provide funding to help restaurants and other eligible businesses keep their doors open through forgivable loans for eligible uses.

Attorney And Former Bank Director Sentenced To 30 Months In Prison For Bank Fraud,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/attorney-and-former-bank-director-sentenced-30-months-prison,"March 19, 2024",2024,"Damian Williams, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, announced that MENDEL ZILBERBERG was sentenced today to 30 months in prison in connection with a scheme to obtain a fraudulent $1.4 million loan from Park Avenue Bank.  The defendant was a member of Park Avenue Bank’s board of directors at the time of the offense.  ZILBERBERG was previously found guilty following a one-week trial before U.S. District Judge George B. Daniels, who imposed today’s sentence.
U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said: “Those entrusted with the stewardship of financial institutions must uphold their responsibilities with integrity, not exploit their positions.  Mendel Zilberberg’s manipulation of his roles as a legal practitioner and a director of Park Avenue Bank exemplifies a disturbing breach: one that led to a staggering loss for the institution.  Safeguarding the integrity of our financial systems is imperative, and this Office will not tire in our mission to track down those who pose threats to this vital cornerstone of stability.”
According to the allegations contained in the Indictment, the evidence offered at trial, and matters included in public filings:
In or about 2009, ZILBERBERG conspired with a co-defendant, Aron Fried, and others to obtain a fraudulent loan from Park Avenue Bank (the “Bank”).  Knowing that the co-conspirators would not be able to obtain the loan directly, the co-conspirators recruited a straw borrower (the “Straw Borrower”) to make the loan application.  The Straw Borrower applied for a $1.4 million loan from the Bank on the basis of numerous lies, as directed by ZILBERBERG and his co-conspirators.
ZILBERBERG used his privileged position at the Bank to ensure that the loan was processed promptly.  Based on the false representations made to the Bank and ZILBERBERG’s involvement in the loan approval process, the Bank issued a $1.4 million loan to the Straw Borrower, which was quickly disbursed to ZILBERBERG and his co-conspirators through multiple bank accounts and transfers.  In total, ZILBERBERG received more than approximately $500,000 of the loan proceeds.  The Straw Borrower received nothing from the loan and ultimately defaulted, resulting in a loss to the Bank of over $1 million.
On November 15, 2022, Fried pled guilty to conspiracy to commit bank fraud.  On April 10, 2023, Judge Daniels sentenced Fried to one year and one day in prison.
*                *                *
In addition to the prison term, ZILBERBERG, 65, of Monsey, New York, was sentenced to three years of supervised release and ordered to pay $1,066,853 in restitution and $506,000 in forfeiture.
Mr. Williams praised the outstanding investigative work of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s Office of the Inspector General.
This case is being handled by the Office’s Complex Frauds and Cybercrime Unit.  Assistant U.S. Attorneys Dina McLeod, Daniel G. Nessim, and Kimberly Ravener, with the assistance of Paralegal Specialist Joseph Carbone, are in charge of the prosecution.

Bank Insider Charged with Obstruction after Making False Statements to Agents About Accepting Bribes,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/bank-insider-charged-obstruction-after-making-false-statements,"March 14, 2024",2024,"NEWARK, N.J. – A Florida-based employee of an international financial institution was arrested today for obstruction of justice after making false statements to agents about accepting bribes, U.S. Attorney Philip R. Sellinger announced.
Gerardo Fermin Aquino Vargas, 38, of Hollywood, Florida, is charged by complaint with one count of obstruction of justice. Aquino had his initial appearance today before U.S. Magistrate Judge Jared M. Strauss in Miami, Florida federal court and was released on $100,000 bond.
According to documents filed in this case and statements made in court:
Aquino worked for an international financial institution at a branch located in Hollywood. Starting in April 2022, Aquino repeatedly and corruptly accepted bribes from individuals in exchange for opening accounts in the names of straw owners who were not present at the account openings. In exchange for the bribes, Aquino also issued debit cards for these accounts and unblocked debit cards that had been flagged for potential fraud by the financial institution. These accounts were used to transfer millions of dollars from the United States to Colombia.
When Aquino was interviewed by law enforcement in November 2023, he made false statements, including that he had only opened one or two accounts when the purported owners were not present at the bank and that he had never received payment for such actions. In fact, Aquino opened at least 28 accounts in this manner and accepted thousands of dollars in bribes for doing so. Aquino’s false statements obstructed a grand jury investigation being conducted in the District of New Jersey.
The charge of obstruction carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a fine of $250,000, or twice the gross amount of any pecuniary gain that any persons derived from the offense, or twice the gross amount of any pecuniary loss sustained by any victims of the offense, whichever is greatest.

"Par Funding Principals Charged in a RICO Indictment in Addition to Pending Charges of Securities Fraud, Extortion, Tax Crimes, Perjury, and Obstruction",https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/par-funding-principals-charged-rico-indictment-addition-pending,"February 27, 2024",2024,"PHILADELPHIA – A second superseding indictment was filed yesterday charging a violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) by three principals of Complete Business Solutions Group, Inc. d/b/a Par Funding (“Par Funding”) and also charging various other crimes included in a previous superseding indictment, including securities fraud, extortionate collection of credit, tax crimes, perjury, obstruction of justice, witness retaliation, and witness tampering, announced United States Attorney Jacqueline C. Romero. These principals are Joseph LaForte, 52, Joseph Cole Barleta (“Joe Cole”), 39, and James LaForte, 46.
A separate indictment was filed charging Joseph LaForte, and his wife, Lisa McElhone, 43, with tax evasion, a conspiracy to avoid paying taxes, and a scheme to avoid paying approximately $1.6 million in income taxes due to the State of Pennsylvania by fraudulently claiming that their residence was Florida, when in fact they resided in Pennsylvania.
According to the second superseding indictment, codefendants Joseph LaForte, Joe Cole, and James LaForte, and others, were part of an association-in-fact RICO enterprise that conspired to commit a number of predicate crimes, including crimes related to the fleecing of Par Funding’s many investors and the extortionate collection of credit from Par Funding’s many merchant-customers. The indictment alleges that when the defendants were sued civilly by the SEC in July 2020, which resulted in a receivership taking over control of Par Funding, the enterprise took various illegal steps to attempt to regain control of Par Funding and to “defeat” the government, including through acts of obstruction of justice, witness tampering, and retaliation. The enterprise was structured with Joe LaForte as its leader and final decisionmaker, and it operated through various family members and close associates.
The indictment alleges that the principal purposes of the LaForte Enterprise were as follows:
It is alleged that as part of their fundraising efforts, these defendants and their conspirators caused false and misleading information to be conveyed to investors regarding various issues, including:
For instance, the indictment alleges that although Joseph LaForte operated Par Funding and referred to it as his business, he concealed this ownership and control by using his wife, Lisa McElhone, as his nominee. Joseph LaForte also used several aliases, such as “Joe Mack,” while working at the company. It is alleged that Joseph LaForte, Joe Cole, James LaForte, and their conspirators engaged in this deception to conceal Joseph LaForte’s true role as the person operating the company and his significant criminal history from investors.
The indictment also alleges that Joseph LaForte and James LaForte conspired with an individual named Renato “Gino” Gioe to participate in the extortionate collection of credit. It is alleged that during the course of Par Funding’s operations, these individuals made hostile, threatening, and intimidating communications to Par Funding’s customers in person and over the telephone in order to collect on delinquent MCAs. For example, the indictment alleges that Joseph LaForte threatened to “blow up” a delinquent customer’s home in May 2019 and asked another delinquent customer in August 2019 whether the customer had heard of “cement shoes.” In addition, the indictment alleges that in May 2018, James LaForte told one customer that he was a “soldier for the family” who had torched people’s cars and kicked people’s teeth in.
Furthermore, the indictment alleges that Joseph LaForte committed a variety of tax crimes. It is alleged that Joseph LaForte committed tax crimes by failing to report millions of dollars in cash kickbacks that he personally received from a Par Funding customer, and by regularly paying cash wages to Par Funding employees but not withholding taxes from these wages or reporting them to the IRS.
It is further alleged that Joseph LaForte and Joe Cole each committed perjury twice during depositions in federal lawsuits against Par Funding, making misrepresentations regarding various matters. For instance, the indictment alleges that Joseph LaForte lied under oath about his knowledge of his wife’s role at Par Funding, Joe Cole’s role at the company, and the company’s default rate. The indictment alleges that Joe Cole lied under oath about who was on Par Funding’s credit committee (which Joseph LaForte ran) and who ran Par Funding.
Finally, the indictment alleges that Joseph LaForte and James LaForte engaged in obstruction of justice, witness tampering, and retaliation. Specifically, it is alleged that in late February 2023, on the streets of Center City Philadelphia, James LaForte, with the assistance of and in coordination with Joseph LaForte, physically assaulted counsel for the receiver for Par Funding in a lawsuit brought by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in the Southern District of Florida. Moreover, in connection with the same lawsuit, the indictment alleges that Joseph LaForte threatened to cause serious bodily injury to another individual in November 2022. Lastly, it is alleged that James LaForte made threats of violence to multiple parties in early 2023, in an effort to interfere with the SEC lawsuit, a federal grand jury investigation, and an anticipated federal prosecution, as well as to retaliate against these parties.
If convicted of all counts charged against them, the defendants are facing decades or more of imprisonment, and they also face full restitution, a fine, and a period of supervised release and/or probation.
In a separate indictment, it is alleged that Joseph LaForte and Lisa McElhone committed several tax crimes. For instance, it is alleged that the married couple defrauded the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania out of more than approximately $1.6 million of state taxes by falsely claiming to be residents of Florida, even though they worked, lived, and spent more than 300 days per year in Pennsylvania. Furthermore, the indictment alleges that Joseph LaForte and Lisa McElhone worked together to evade the payment of over half a million dollars of employment taxes that had been imposed on Joseph LaForte in connection with companies that he had operated in the mid-2000s.
An indictment charging Complete Business Solutions Group, Inc., doing business as Par Funding, with wire fraud, securities fraud, and conspiracy, was also filed.
The case was investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigation, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation-Office of Inspector General, and Pennsylvania State Police and is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys Patrick J. Murray, Alexandra Lastowski, and Matthew Newcomer. The SEC in Florida investigated and litigated the civil securities fraud charges, which formed the basis of a portion of the criminal prosecution.

Professional Money Launderer Sentenced to 40 Months in Prison for Transmitting $42 Million,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/professional-money-launderer-sentenced-40-months-prison,"February 16, 2024",2024,"SAN DIEGO –Jesus Vazquez Padilla of Tijuana was sentenced in federal court today to 40 months in custody for the unlicensed transmission of more than $42 million of illicit proceeds derived from the sale of drugs across the United States.
According to court records, between January 4, 2016 and May 24, 2019, Vazquez Padilla led the operation of an illegal unlicensed money transmission business by using 22 shell corporations and 85 corporate bank accounts at various U.S. banks to launder drug sale proceeds. Using the corporate bank accounts, Vazquez Padilla and his co-conspirators offered money transmitting services to the public for a fee by performing tasks that included: (1) depositing cash at financial institutions throughout the United States; (2) transferring money by wire, checks, and inter-bank transfers, and (3) transferring money to Mexico on behalf of third parties.
“The complexity of this money laundering operation was remarkable but as it unraveled so did the string of drug proceeds into the coffers of the cartels,” said U.S. Attorney Tara McGrath. “The United States will prosecute not only the drug traffickers, but also the facilitators who cannot out-maneuver justice.”
“Mr. Vasquez Padilla knowingly and willingly subverted laws that protect our financial institutions from becoming unwitting pawns in funding transnational crime and terrorism,” said Special Agent in Charge Tyler Hatcher, IRS Criminal Investigation, Los Angeles Field Office. “Furthermore, by moving over $42 million in drug money, Mr. Vasquez Padilla and his co-conspirators’ put our sons and daughters at risk of becoming statistics in the drug crisis we face as a country. IRS Criminal Investigation is committed to following the money to bring criminals like Mr. Vasquez Padilla to justice.”
In total, Vazquez Padilla’s business deposited $42,276,668 into the U.S. financial system. Of those deposits, approximately 95 percent of those funds were transferred to third party bank accounts in Mexico. The remaining 5 percent constituted the business’ fee for transmitting the funds.
Under U.S. law, a money transmission business must register with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a bureau of the U.S. Department of Treasury; file Currency Transaction Reports and Suspicious Activity Reports; and maintain an effective anti-money laundering compliance program.  Vazquez Padilla did not comply with any of these requirements.
On December 5, 2022, Vazquez-Padilla’s co-conspirator, Jose Gonzalez, was sentenced to 30 months’ custody for operating an unlicensed money transmission business and for assisting in the preparation of false tax returns related to the conspiracy.  Gonzalez helped Vazquez Padilla open approximately 11 shell corporations and then, to create a veneer of legitimacy, Gonzalez filed federal tax returns on behalf of 10 of the shell corporations in tax years 2016 and 2017.  In doing so, Gonzalez invented $19,615,192 in false and fictitious deductions so the shell corporations would not owe taxes.
On December 18, 2023, another co-conspirator, Juan Medina, was sentenced to 12 months and one day in custody for operating an unlicensed money transmission business.  Despite knowing the laundered money represented illegal drug proceeds, Medina helped Vazquez Padilla open bank accounts for the shell corporations to enable the money laundering.
Vazquez Padilla’s sister and co-conspirator, Monica Vazquez, remains at large.
Assistant U.S. Attorneys Christopher Beeler and Carl Brooker of the Southern District of California are prosecuting the case.

Six Men Sentenced for Roles in $20M COVID-19 Relief Fraud Ring,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/six-men-sentenced-roles-20m-covid-19-relief-fraud-ring,"February 12, 2024",2024,"Six Texas men were sentenced today for their roles in a conspiracy to fraudulently obtain more than $20 million in forgivable Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans that the Small Business Administration (SBA) guaranteed under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.
Hamza Abbas, 31, Ammas Uddin, 31, and Arham Uddin, 27, all of Richmond, were sentenced to three years and eight months, one year and six months, and one year and six months in prison, respectively; Syed Ali, 55, of Sugar Land, was sentenced to two years in prison; and Muhammad Anis, 55, and Jesus Acosta Perez, 33, both of Houston, were sentenced to one year and nine months and one year and one day in prison, respectively. All six defendants previously pleaded guilty.
According to court documents, the defendants conspired together and with others to fraudulently obtain PPP loans by, among other means, supplying information about their businesses to be used to submit false and fraudulent PPP loan applications. Specifically, the PPP loan applications falsified the numbers of employees and the average monthly payroll expenses of the applicant businesses. The loan applications also included fraudulent bank records and fake federal tax forms in support of the PPP loan applications. Abbas also recruited others into the conspiracy and created fraudulent bank records that were used in support of the loan applications in exchange for kickbacks.
The defendants also laundered a portion of the fraudulent proceeds by writing checks from companies that received PPP loans to fake employees. These fake paychecks were cashed at certain cash checking businesses, including one owned by another co-conspirator.
In January, three other individuals who previously pleaded guilty were sentenced for their roles in the loan fraud scheme. Raheel Malik, 43, of Sugar Land, was sentenced to one year and six months in prison; Nishant Patel, 41, of Houston, was sentenced to two years in prison; and Harjeet Sing, 50, of Katy, was sentenced to five years of probation.
In October 2023, seven other individuals were sentenced for their roles in the loan fraud conspiracy, including the ringleader, Amir Aqeel, 55, of Houston, who was sentenced to 15 years in prison.

Developer Sentenced for Conspiring with First NBC Bank President to Defraud First NBC Bank,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/developer-sentenced-conspiring-first-nbc-bank-president-defraud,"February 8, 2024",2024,"NEW ORLEANS – On February 5, 2024, United States District Judge Darrel James Papillion sentenced WARREN G. TREME (“TREME”) , age 59, a resident of Metairie, announced U.S. Attorney Duane A. Evans. TREME previously pleaded guilty to bank fraud conspiracy for his role in the scheme that led to the downfall of First NBC Bank, the New Orleans-based bank that failed in April 2017.
TREME , who testified as a government witness at the January 2023 trial of former First NBC Bank President and CEO Ashton Ryan, was sentenced by Judge Papillion to 24 months in prison, followed by three years of supervised release, a $100 mandatory special assessment fee, as well as payment of $6,399,890.38 in restitution, to First NBC Bank’s successors. TREME is jointly and severally liable for the restitution amount with Ryan and William J. Burnell, the Bank’s Chief Credit Officer.
According to court documents, from in or around 2008 through April 2017, TREME had a banking relationship with First NBC Bank, individually and through various entities he controlled. TREME also co-owned several entities with  Ryan. Because of this conflict of interest, Ryan should not have been involved with TREME’s loans. However, Ryan exercised authority over TREME’s loans, along with Burnell. Throughout TREME’s borrowing relationship at First NBC Bank, TREME lacked sufficient income and cash flow from his businesses to pay his loans and personal expenses. Ryan and Burnell disguised TREME’s true financial condition by making new loans to pay TREME’s existing loans.
Court documents further describe a scheme by Ryan and Burnell to take $400,000 from TREME’s business partners as part of a settlement. Rather than using the $400,000 to pay down an outstanding loan debt owed by TREME and his business partners, Ryan and Burnell gave $300,000 to TREME . TREME spent the money on gambling, a trip to the Caribbean, and expenses related to a real estate development company co-owned by TREME and Ryan. During a subsequent Board meeting, Ryan and Burnell falsely stated that the $300,000 was used to pay down the outstanding loan debt owed by TREME and his business partners.
Ryan was sentenced to 170 months in prison for his role in this scheme, while Burnell was sentenced to 48 months in prison. Both Ryan and Burnell were sentenced by U.S. District Judge Eldon E. Fallon.
U.S. Attorney Evans praised the work of the agencies that conducted this years-long investigation: the Federal Bureau of Investigation - New Orleans Field Office; the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of Inspector General, Dallas Regional Office; and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Office of Inspector General, Miami Field Office. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Matthew R. Payne of the Financial Crimes Unit, Nicholas D. Moses, Health Care Fraud Coordinator, J. Ryan McLaren of the Appellate Unit, and Rachal Cassagne of the Narcotics Unit, are in charge of the prosecution.

With this scam, imposters pose as law enforcement officers and send text messages to a target recipient.  These messages may include images of fake federal court documents that falsely assert criminal fraud charges against the recipient arising from the Paycheck Protection Program and/or the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.  The fake federal court notice may also advise the target that they can avoid arrest by paying “preemptive bail bond.”
In addition to fake federal court documents, the scam may involve images of fake correspondence from the FDIC OIG and FDIC Legal Division which purports to explain the “preemptive bail opportunity.”
The public is reminded that if you receive any communication purportedly from the U.S. Attorney’s Office, the FDIC OIG, or the federal court asking for sensitive personal information, or demanding payment through gift cards, wire transfers, or digital currency – DO NOT TRANSMIT MONEY OR SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION.  Instead, the public is encouraged to contact the appropriate authorities with the information below..
“These fraudsters utilize fear and pressure tactics to create a sense of urgency in their victims and often prey on the most vulnerable in our society,” said U.S. Attorney Robert Troester. “If you are contacted by someone who demands payment or private information, do not engage. Instead, report the incident to law enforcement.”
“Scammers such as these may use the FDIC or FDIC OIG logo and seal to make their demand for funds appear legitimate” said FDIC OIG Special Agent in Charge Anand Ramlall. “The FDIC OIG reminds the public that the FDIC and FDIC OIG will not send unsolicited correspondence that requests sensitive personal information or demands payment through gift cards, wire transfers, or digital currency. Such correspondence should be reported to the FDIC OIG hotline.”

Former chairman of 1 Global sentenced to five years in prison for running $250 million securities fraud scheme,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/former-chairman-1-global-sentenced-five-years-prison-running-250,"February 1, 2024",2024,"MIAMI – On Jan. 31, the former chairman of 1 Global Capital LLC (“1 Global”) was sentenced to five years in prison for carrying out a $250 million securities fraud conspiracy scheme.
The sentence comes after Carl R. Ruderman, 82, of Aventura, Florida, entered his guilty plea in October 2023. Chief U.S. District Judge Cecilia M. Altonaga also ordered Ruderman to pay a forfeiture money judgment in the amount of $285,599,532, as agreed in his plea agreement. Ruderman’s restitution order is still pending.
Ruderman was the chairman of 1 Global, a commercial lending business based in Hallandale Beach, Florida, that made the equivalent of “pay day” loans to small businesses at high interest rates, termed merchant cash advance loans (“MCAs”).
Ruderman admitted that he and others made false and misleading representations to investors and potential investors as to the profitability of 1 Global’s business in marketing materials and periodic account statements. According to plea documents, investors were falsely told that 1 Global had audited financials by a public accounting firm, that the investor’s money would be spent on the MCAs, and that they could expect double-digit returns on their investments, among other things.
Ruderman admitted that he spent 1 Global’s investor’s money on credit card payments, vacation travel, insurance payments for his art collection and valuable jewelry, drivers, nannies, housekeepers, mortgage payments for his house, tuition, and payments for a luxury car. Ruderman also admitted that he diverted 1 Global investor money to businesses benefitting him and his family, without the investors’ knowledge.
Questions arose during the operation of the business as to whether 1 Global was offering or selling a security and whether the investment offering was required to be registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Ruderman admitted in plea documents that he knew that if 1 Global’s investment offering were determined to be a security, it would undermine the ability of 1 Global to raise funds from retail investors and to continue to operate without substantial additional expenses and reporting requirements. Ruderman also admitted that he directed a lawyer, Jan Atlas, to author two opinion letters in 2016 containing false information that allowed 1 Global to skirt federal securities laws.
Four of Ruderman’s co-conspirators, all from South Florida, previously pleaded guilty and were sentenced for their roles in the fraud scheme, including two lawyers who provided Ruderman with false legal cover to skirt federal securities laws. The co-conspirators cases are referenced below:
Alan G. Heide, the former chief financial officer of 1 Global pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit securities fraud (case no. 19-cr-60231) and was sentenced to 60 months in prison by U.S. District Judge Roy K. Altman. Judge Altman also ordered Heide to pay over $57 million in restitution to the victims of the scheme.
Attorney Andrew Dale Ledbetter pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud and securities fraud (case no. 20-cr-60103) and was sentenced by Judge Altman to 60 months in prison. Judge Altman also ordered Ledbetter to pay over $148 million to the victims of the scheme.
Steven Allen Schwartz, the former chief operating officer of 1 Global pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud and securities fraud (case no. 20-cr-60003) and was sentenced to 24 months in prison by Judge Altman. Judge Altman also ordered Schwartz to pay over $36 million in restitution to the victims of the scheme.
Attorney Jan Douglas Atlas pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud and securities fraud (case no. 19-cr-60258) and was sentenced to eight months in prison by Judge Altman. Judge Altman also ordered Atlas to pay over $29 million in restitution to the victims of the scheme.
1 Global filed for bankruptcy on July 27, 2018. As of that time, according to documents from related cases, 1 Global had more than 3,400 investors and had raised more than $250 million during the scheme. The bankruptcy case, In re: 1 Global Capital LLC, et al., No. 18-19121-RBR (S.D. Fla.), remains pending.
The SEC previously filed civil fraud actions related to the 1 Global fraud, captioned, SEC v. 1 Global Capital LLC and Carl C. Ruderman, Case No. 18-61991-CV-BB (S.D. Fla.); SEC v. Alan G. Heide, Case No. 19-62047-CV-FAM (S.D. Fla.); SEC v. Jan Douglas Atlas, 19-62303-CV-WPD (S.D. Fla.); SEC v. Steven A. Schwartz, Case No. 20-80008-CV-DMM (S.D. Fla.); and SEC v.

According to court documents, between January 2018 and October 2021, Mark Black, 50, of Arlington, Virginia, was a member of two online groups dedicated to exploiting children. The goal of the two groups was to locate prepubescent girls online and convince them to livestream themselves engaging in sexually explicit conduct.

The co-conspirator surreptitiously hacked into that girl’s live-video feed and recorded the sexual acts before sending them to Black.
Black was formerly the Arlington Aquatic Club (AAC) board president.
Black pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to produce child pornography and one count of coercion and enticement. He is scheduled to be sentenced on April 30 and faces a mandatory minimum of 15 years in prison and a maximum penalty of life in prison.

CEO Sentenced for Transnational “Cherry-Picking” Scheme Involving Foreign Exchange and Cryptocurrency Futures Contracts,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/ceo-sentenced-transnational-cherry-picking-scheme-involving,"January 19, 2024",2024,"First Criminal Charge Against a Commodities Trading Advisor and Commodities Pool Operator for Engaging in a “Cherry-Picking” Scheme Involving Cryptocurrency Futures Contracts
A chief executive officer of an investment firm was sentenced today to two years in prison followed by one year and six months of home confinement and ordered to forfeit approximately $1.6 million for a “cherry-picking” scheme, in which he fraudulently misappropriated profitable trades to himself and saddled his investors with losses.
According to court documents, Peter Kambolin, 48, a U.S.-Russian national of Sunny Isles Beach, Florida, was the owner and chief executive officer of Systematic Alpha Management LLC (SAM), an investment firm that Kambolin marketed as offering algorithmic trading strategies involving futures contracts. Established in 2007, by 2011, SAM had more than $720 million in assets under management. Between January 2019 and November 2021, Kambolin, who at the time was a commodity trading advisor and a commodity pool operator, engaged in a cherry-picking scheme in which he fraudulently allocated profits and losses from futures trades in a manner designed to benefit his own accounts unfairly at the expense of his clients. Kambolin also misrepresented to his clients that SAM employed trading strategies focused on cryptocurrency futures contracts and foreign exchange futures contracts, when in reality, approximately half of Kambolin’s trading in each pool involved equity index futures contracts. In doing so, Kambolin defrauded investors located in the United States and abroad by, among other things, depriving them of profitable trades. Kambolin used the proceeds of the scheme to fund personal expenses, including rent for a beachfront apartment, and transferred proceeds to foreign bank accounts his co-conspirator controlled in Belarus and Dominica.
During the relevant period, Kambolin executed trades for pool participants together with trades he executed on behalf of his proprietary accounts, and fraudulently allocated the profits and losses of the trades to benefit his own accounts.
Kambolin pleaded guilty on Oct. 11, 2023, to one count of conspiracy to commit commodities fraud.

2 Indicted in $8.5 Million Nationwide Airbnb/Vrbo Scam that Allegedly Defrauded 1000s of Victims and Discriminated Against Renters,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/2-indicted-85-million-nationwide-airbnbvrbo-scam-allegedly,"January 4, 2024",2024,"LOS ANGELES – A federal grand jury has indicted two men on federal fraud charges that allege a double-booking, bait-and-switch scam run through online property rental platforms – primarily Airbnb – that brought in more than $8.5 million through misleading listings and fraudulently canceling reservations, which included discrimination against Black people, the Justice Department announced today.
Shray Goel, 35, of Miami, and Shaunik Raheja, 34, of Denver, were charged Wednesday in a superseding indictment that accuses them of fraud in connection with more than 10,000 reservations linked to nearly 100 properties across 10 states.
Goel was initially charged in an indictment returned on December 13. He was arrested in Florida on December 27 and was released on bond the following day. Raheja was added as a defendant in the superseding indictment. Both defendants are expected to be arraigned in United States District Court in Los Angeles in the coming weeks.
The superseding indictment alleges that Goel and Raheja owned and operated a short-term property rental business that they used to defraud Airbnb, Vrbo and guests renting properties through those platforms. The business operated under various names, including Abbot Pacific LLC.
Goel, Raheja and others who worked with them are alleged to have owned and leased properties throughout the United States for the rental business, including properties in Los Angeles; Malibu, California; Marina Del Rey, California; Denver; Chicago; Davenport, Florida; Savannah, Georgia; Bloomington, Indiana; South Bend, Indiana; Cleveland; Nashville, Tennessee; Austin, Texas; Dallas and Milwaukee. By 2019, according to the superseding indictment, they were managing nearly 100 properties across the United States.
To carry out the fraudulent scheme, Goel and Raheja allegedly double-booked properties through multiple listings of the same property on Airbnb and Vrbo, and then invented bogus last-minute excuses – often claiming plumbing problems – to cancel overbooked guests or trick them into moving to inferior replacement accommodations. According to the superseding indictment, members of the conspiracy profited from the scheme by running a secret bidding war for the properties – meaning they posted multiple listings for the same property at different prices for the same night, allowed the highest bidder to rent a particular property, and then cancelled or switched the lower-paying guests to a different property in the area. The scheme also allegedly allowed Goel, Raheja and their co-conspirators to keep all of their properties in any given area at maximum capacity by using popular listings as bait to trick guests into booking those listings, and then steering overbooked guests at the last minute to less popular and open listings in the same area.
The superseding indictment further alleges that “Goel and Raheja made decisions about which guests to keep and which to cancel based in part on their racial prejudices and discrimination.” The defendants, according to the indictment, tried to avoid renting to guests they perceived to be Black and “in this way depriv[ed] these guests of their property interest in the reservations and otherwise caus[ed] these guests to suffer monetary losses when their reservations were cancelled.”
“This deplorable scheme victimized thousands of consumers and families across the country, some of whom allegedly were discriminated against because of racial bias,” said United States Attorney Martin Estrada. “Fueled by greed, the defendants deceived consumers about the locations and conditions of properties, canceled reservations to double-book properties and based on racial prejudices, and lied to victims leaving them scrambling to find last-minute replacement accommodations. The sheer number of victims is astonishing, as is the millions of dollars earned though the scheme that took advantage of the reputations of online rental platforms that offer a valuable service.”
“The defendants are charged with preying on unsuspecting travelers and robbing them of time and money, leaving them with no choice but to settle for inferior lodging at the last minute,” said Donald Alway, the Assistant Director in Charge of the FBI’s Los Angeles Field Office. “The conspiracy charge alleging that the defendants discriminated against potential renters based on their skin color is a reprehensible abuse which must not be tolerated in the United States. The FBI will work with our federal partners and with the private sector to ensure business practices in the vacation rental industry are free of fraud and bias.”
“This indictment charges defendants for their alleged roles in a scheme to defraud Airbnb, Vrbo, and guests renting properties through those platforms,” said Special Agent in Charge Ryan Korner of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC-OIG). “FDIC-OIG remains steadfastly committed to protecting our nation and innocent victims by identifying and bringing to justice individuals who orchestrate these types of fraudulent schemes.”
According to the superseding indictment, Goel, Raheja and their co-schemers used fake host names and, in certain instances, other people’s identities to list properties. They allegedly used these fake host accounts to conceal their own identities, to double-book properties, and to post fabricated positive reviews of their properties. They were also allegedly using the fake host accounts to continue to list properties after they had been banned from Vrbo in 2015 because of repeated host cancellations and guest complaints.
In some cases, according to the superseding indictment, Goel, Raheja and their accomplices listed fake addresses, addresses that did not have any rental housing, were unaffiliated with the schemers, or did not exist at all – using these fake addresses to create duplicate listings for a single purported property. The fake addresses also allegedly allowed them to evade local rules and regulations governing short-term rentals, and to control who had access to properties.
To further their fraud, Goel and Raheja allegedly took steps to prevent negative reviews from affecting their business by falsely discrediting such reviews and otherwise trying to hide them from prospective future guests. According to the superseding indictment, they would post bogus negative reviews about the guests who had panned their listings or called out the fraudulent and deceptive listing practices, and they would remove negatively reviewed listings and then re-list the properties using new listing identifiers, thereby purging the bad reviews from the properties.
According to the superseding indictment, Goel and Raheja used these and other lies and misrepresentations to trick guests into booking properties they would not have otherwise booked and to keep payments from guests entitled to refunds. The last-minute nature of the cancellations also caused guests and the rental platforms to suffer losses when guests were forced to find alternative lodging at the last minute.
“In 2018 and 2019, in the course of the scheme and in furtherance of it, defendants Goel and Raheja and others working with them and at their direction booked more than 10,000 reservations through Airbnb, receiving more than $7 million in payouts on those reservations; they booked additional and sometimes conflicting reservations through Vrbo and received more than $1.5 million in additional payouts from those reservations,” according to the indictment.
An indictment is merely an allegation. All defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.
The superseding indictment charges Goel and Raheja with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and 13 counts of wire fraud. Goel is additionally charged with two counts of aggravated identity theft.
The conspiracy and wire fraud charges each carry a statutory maximum penalty of 20 years in federal prison. There is a two-year mandatory consecutive sentence for the aggravated identity theft counts.
The FBI and FDIC-OIG are investigating this matter. The Federal Housing Finance Agency – Office of Inspector General is assisting in the investigation.
Both Airbnb and Vrbo are cooperating with the government in this investigation, and the government recognizes and appreciates that cooperation.
Assistant United States Attorney Kerry L. Quinn of the Major Frauds Section is prosecuting the case.

According to court documents, Armando Herrera, 43, of Miami, and his co-conspirators established companies in Florida, Texas, Washington, and California, which they used to sell and distribute adulterated prescription drugs, primarily HIV medications, to wholesale pharmaceutical suppliers. Herrera and his co-conspirators created false documentation to make it appear as though the drugs were acquired legitimately when, in fact, they were not. The pharmaceutical suppliers then sold the drugs to pharmacies, which dispensed the adulterated prescription drugs to unwitting patients. As part of the investigation, federal agents seized more than $1.5 million worth of adulterated prescription drugs from Herrera, including more than 16,000 tablets of adulterated and misbranded HIV medication.
Herrera pleaded guilty on Sept. 25 to one count of conspiracy to introduce adulterated and misbranded drugs into interstate commerce.

Woman Convicted of $7M COVID-19 Relief Fraud,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/woman-convicted-7m-covid-19-relief-fraud,"December 20, 2023",2023,"A federal jury in the Northern District of Georgia convicted a Georgia attorney and former City of Atlanta police officer yesterday of fraudulently obtaining over $7 million in loans under the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP).
According to court documents and evidence presented at trial, Shelitha Robertson, 62, of Atlanta, conspired to submit PPP loan applications on behalf of four businesses she owned. The loan applications falsely inflated the number of employees and average monthly payroll for each of the four businesses, inducing larger PPP loans than Robertson could legitimately obtain. Robertson and a co-conspirator also caused the submission of false tax documents to support the false statements in each loan application. Robertson used the loan proceeds to purchase luxury items, including a 10-carat diamond ring, and to transfer funds to family members and her co-conspirator.
The jury convicted Robertson of one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, three counts of wire fraud, and one count of money laundering. She is scheduled to be sentenced on April 11, 2024, and faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison for each count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and wire fraud, and a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison for money laundering. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.
Robertson is the second defendant to be convicted as part of the Justice Department’s prosecution of an approximately $15 million PPP fraud conspiracy. Robertson’s co-conspirator pleaded guilty prior to trial.

Brockton Man Pleads Guilty to Fraudulently Obtaining More Than $1.5 Million in COVID-Relief Funds,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/brockton-man-pleads-guilty-fraudulently-obtaining-more-15,"December 19, 2023",2023,"BOSTON – A Brockton man pleaded guilty today in federal court in Boston in connection with a scheme to submit false applications to obtain Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) and Economic Injury Disaster Loan Program (EIDL) funds through the Small Business Administration (SBA) that were made available under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.
Joao Mendes, 60, pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud. U.S. District Court Judge Nathaniel M. Gorton scheduled sentencing for April 9, 2024. Mendes was charged in July 2022.
Beginning in or around June 2020 and continuing until at least in or around September 2020, Mendes submitted or caused to be submitted multiple fraudulent PPP and EIDL loan applications on behalf of various entities. The fraudulent PPP loan applications misrepresented the number of employees and the average monthly payroll expenses of Mendes’s various businesses. Mendes also submitted false tax records in support of his loan applications. In his EIDL applications, Mendes misrepresented the number of employees, gross revenues and costs of goods sold for each business. Based on the fraudulent applications, Mendes and others received more than $1.5 million in PPP and EIDL funds. Once Mendes received the funds, he either spent them for his own personal benefit—including for the purchase of cryptocurrency—or transferred the funds into other accounts he controlled or to other individuals.
The United States seized cryptocurrency and fiat currency from over 20 accounts, resulting in the recovery of $1.545 million in cryptocurrency and more than $206,000 in U.S. currency, which will be criminally forfeited.
The CARES Act is a federal law enacted on March 29, 2020, designed to provide emergency financial assistance to the millions of Americans who are suffering the economic effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. One source of relief provided by the CARES Act was the authorization of forgivable loans to small businesses for job retention and certain approved expenses, through the PPP. Another is the EIDL, through which the SBA offers loans that can only be used on certain permissible business expenses, which can include payment of fixed business debts, payroll, accounts payable, and other business-related expenses that could have been paid had the COVID-19 disaster not occurred. The American Rescue Plan Act established the RRF to provide funding to help restaurants and other eligible businesses keep their doors open through forgivable loans for eligible uses.
The charge of wire fraud provides for a sentence of up to 20 years in prison, up to three years of supervised release and a fine of up to $250,000 or twice the gross gain or loss from the offense. Sentences are imposed by a federal district court judge based upon the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and statutes which govern the determination of a sentence in a criminal case.

Florida Man Admits Fraudulently Obtaining $2.4 Million in CARES Act Loans,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/florida-man-admits-fraudulently-obtaining-24-million-cares-act,"November 21, 2023",2023,"TRENTON, N.J. – A Florida man admitted fraudulently obtaining over $2.4 million in federal Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans and Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) payments, U.S. Attorney Philip R. Sellinger, announced today.
Mohamed A. Awad, 61, of Ocala, Florida, pleaded guilty on Nov. 20, 2023, before Judge Michael A. Shipp in Trenton federal court to an information charging him with wire fraud and money laundering.
“The defendant admitted falsifying documents to obtain millions of dollars from government programs that were intended to provide financial help to Americans who were struggling to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic. My office continues to work with all of our law enforcement partners to find and punish those who take advantage of these vital programs.”
U.S. Attorney Philip R. Sellinger
“The defendant’s abuse of a program designed for those in need is appalling,” Tammy Tomlins, Special Agent in Charge of the Newark Field Office, said. “Today’s plea demonstrates the significant consequence for fraudulently accessing government programs to steal from taxpayers. IRS Criminal Investigation and our law enforcement partners are committed to protecting the integrity of relief programs.”
According to documents filed in this case and statements made in court:
The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act is a federal law enacted on March 29, 2020, designed to provide emergency financial assistance to the millions of Americans suffering the economic effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Awad engaged in a scheme to illegally obtain over $2.4 million in PPP and EIDL loans through numerous misrepresentations to lenders. He submitted fraudulent loan applications that fabricated numbers of employees and misrepresented company information, to induce PPP and EIDL lenders to approve the loan applications that they otherwise would not have approved. Awad submitted falsified tax documents in support of PPP applications. According to IRS records, none of the purported tax documents that Awad submitted in support of the loan applications were ever in fact filed with the IRS. Awad thereafter transferred the loan proceeds among various bank accounts he controlled, withdrawing significant amounts in cash and transferring loan proceeds out of the country via wire transfers to banks based in Egypt.
The charge of wire fraud carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and a maximum fine of $250,000 or twice the gross gain to the defendant or gross loss to the victim, whichever is greatest. The charge of money laundering carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and a maximum fine of $500,000, or twice the value of the monetary instrument or funds involved in the laundering offense, whichever is greater. Sentencing is scheduled for April 9, 2024.

"Piatt County, Illinois, Farmer Sentenced to 42 Months in Prison for Bank Fraud",https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/piatt-county-illinois-farmer-sentenced-42-months-prison-bank,"November 20, 2023",2023,"SPRINGFIELD, Ill. –James R. R. Williams, 64, formerly of rural Cisco, Illinois, and now residing in Fort Meyers, Florida, was sentenced on November 17, 2023, by U.S. District Judge Collen R. Lawless to 42 months’ imprisonment, to be followed by three years of supervised release, and ordered to pay restitution to two central Illinois banks following his convictions for four counts of bank fraud.
At the sentencing hearing, which took place over two days, the government presented evidence that during the 2016 growing season Williams obtained a loan of approximately $4.6 million from participating banks First Security Bank and Gifford State Bank on behalf of his farming operation, RJW Williams Farms, Inc. The loans were collateralized by Williams’s assets, including grain. Williams defrauded the banks by concealing grain sales from the banks and by instructing employees of Archer Daniels Midland grain elevators in Niantic and Weldon, Illinois, to issue checks in his son’s name, without his son’s knowledge, which were then deposited into an account held jointly by Williams and his son. Williams then used the checks for his own benefit. Judge Lawless found that between October 20, 2014, and February 1, 2017, Williams caused ADM to issue approximately twenty-two checks totaling $540,505.35 to his son for grain that was actually sold by Williams and was collateral for Williams’s outstanding loan.
Judge Lawless also determined that Williams knowingly violated a court order in Piatt County Circuit Court that was intended to freeze grain sale disbursements following a citation to discover assets hearing and that the bankruptcy petition filed by RJW Williams Farms, Inc., and signed by Williams as president contained numerous false assertions.
A federal grand jury first returned an indictment against Williams in June 2019, and he pleaded guilty to the four bank fraud counts in May 2023.
Williams faced statutory penalties of a maximum twenty-year term of imprisonment, a maximum $1 million fine, and a maximum five-year term of supervised release on the bank fraud counts.
“This sentencing reflects the FDIC OIG’s commitment to bring to justice those who defraud banks and use stolen funds for their own personal gain,” said Special Agent in Charge Vincent R. Zehme, of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC OIG). “We will continue to work with our law enforcement and DOJ partners to investigate and hold those accountable who commit such financial crimes and threaten to undermine the integrity of our Nation’s financial institutions.”
“Today’s sentencing sends a strong message that the bankruptcy system requires full, accurate and complete disclosures, and those who fail to do so will be held accountable,” stated Nancy J. Gargula, U.S. Trustee for Central Illinois, Southern Illinois, and Indiana (Region 10).  “I am grateful to U.S. Attorney Gregory K. Harris and our law enforcement partners for their strong commitment to uphold the integrity of the bankruptcy system.”
The matter was referred by the U.S. Trustee and investigated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation -- Office of Inspector General in collaboration with the Central District of Illinois Bankruptcy Fraud Working Group, coordinated by U.S. Trustee Gargula.  The United States Trustee Program is the component of the Justice Department that protects the integrity of the bankruptcy system by overseeing case administration and litigating to enforce the bankruptcy laws. Region 10 is headquartered in Indianapolis, with additional offices in South Bend, Ind., and Peoria, Ill.
The case investigation was conducted by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation -- Office of Inspector General. Supervisory Assistant U.S. Attorneys Eugene L. Miller and Douglas J. Quivey, along with Assistant U.S. Attorney William J. Lynch, represented the government in the prosecution.

Robert Sedlar sentenced to more than 25 years in prison after being convicted of 100 felony counts
Mortgage scheme targeted homeowners in San Diego, San Mateo, Alameda, Contra Costa, San Joaquin, Placer, Solano, Mendocino, San Francisco, El Dorado, and Sacramento counties
OAKLAND — California Attorney General Rob Bonta today announced the sentencing of Robert Sedlar, who was convicted on 100 felony counts for carrying out a $7 million mortgage fraud scheme. The scheme targeted vulnerable homeowners in financial distress in 11 counties across California. As a result of the scheme, every one of Sedlar's victims lost their homes. Today, Sedlar was sentenced to 25 years and four months in state prison. The prosecution in the case was carried out by the California Department of Justice (DOJ).
“Robert Sedlar and his company preyed on vulnerable Californians who simply wanted to stay in their homes,” said Attorney General Bonta. “Because of his crimes, his victims lost their funds, their peace of mind, and the very roofs over their heads. Today, due to the hard work of DOJ’s legal and investigative teams, and our federal and local law enforcement partners, we're holding Sedlar accountable for his crimes. Let today’s sentence serve as a warning: Bad actors who try to scam, defraud, or cheat Californians will be brought to justice.”
Sedlar was the president of Grand View Financial LLC, a purported mortgage “investment” company that advertised assistance to desperate homeowners facing foreclosure. The victims were located in the counties of San Diego, San Mateo, Alameda, Contra Costa, San Joaquin, Placer, Solano, Mendocino, San Francisco, El Dorado, and Sacramento.
The company promised consumers that if they transferred the title of their house to Grandview Financial and paid money, it would eliminate the mortgage lien and deed the home back to the homeowner, clear of any liens. During this time, the company filed false court documents, false documents with the county recorders offices, and false bankruptcies that stalled the foreclosures but did nothing to eliminate the liens, all while collecting funds from the victims. Every single victim lost their homes as a result and the scheme resulted in a combined loss of more than $7 million.
After a five-week trial in Sacramento County, Sedlar was found guilty in May 2023 of conspiracy as well as multiple counts of filing a false document, grand theft, elder abuse, and prohibited acts by a foreclosure consultant. Two other employees of Grand View Financial — Steven Rogers and Audrey Gan — previously pleaded guilty to charges of grand theft, elder abuse and prohibited acts by a foreclosure consultant.
The prosecution was carried out by DOJ’s Fraud and Special Prosecutions Section (SPS). The indictment and arrests in this case were the result of a joint investigation by SPS, DOJ’s White Collar Investigation Team; the United States Office of Inspector General, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation; the United States Office of Inspector General, Federal Housing Finance Agency; the United States Trustee Program; the United States Marshals Service; the Stanislaus County District Attorney's Office; the El Dorado County District Attorney’s Office; the United States Trustees, Los Angeles Field Office, and United States Trustee Peter C.

John Jhong, 54, of Sparta, New Jersey, previously pleaded guilty before U.S. District Judge Susan D. Wigenton to an information charging him with one count each of bank fraud, money laundering, and misuse of a Social Security number. Judge Wigenton imposed the sentence on Nov. 15, 2023, in Newark federal court.
“The defendant took money from government programs that were established to provide financial assistance to Americans who were struggling to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic. The sentence handed down today is his reward for attempting to turn these vital relief programs into his personal ATM. We will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to find and punish those who have tried to take advantage of the federal government.”
U.S. Attorney Philip R. Sellinger
“The theft of taxpayer funds is inexcusable,” Tammy Tomlins, Special Agent in Charge of IRS – Criminal Investigation, Newark Field Office, said. “IRS Criminal investigation will hold accountable anyone who steals from government programs intended to help those in need.  We remain committed to working with our law enforcement partners to ensure fraudsters are brought to justice. Today’s sentence punishes the defendant’s criminal conduct and should serve as a significant deterrent to others who would selfishly steal from their fellow citizens to unlawfully enrich themselves.”
“Ensuring the Postal Service is not being used to perpetuate frauds against the U.S. Government, or its citizens, is one of our top priorities,” Christoper A. Nielsen, Inspector in Charge, Philadelphia Division, said. “The Postal Inspection Service will continue to investigate CAREs Act fraud schemes through our participation in the NJ COVID-19 Fraud Enforcement Strike Force.”
“Today the defendant in this case was brought to justice for fraudulently obtaining more than $2 million in COVID-19 relief funding that was designed to assist struggling businesses during the pandemic,” Special Agent in Charge Patricia Tarasca of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC OIG) saod. “The FDIC OIG will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to investigate and hold accountable those who took advantage of pandemic relief programs and threatened to undermine the integrity of our Nation’s financial institutions.”
“As the nation was struggling with the damaging effects of the pandemic, Mr. Jhong callously attempted to deceive lenders and fraudulently secure Paycheck Protection Program loans by knowingly misusing several Social Security numbers,” Gail S. Ennis, Inspector General for the Social Security Administration, said. “I thank the investigating agencies and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for their efforts in holding Mr. Jhong accountable for these crimes.”
According to documents filed in this case and statements made in court:
Jhong submitted numerous fraudulent loan applications in which he sought over $15 million in federal pandemic aid and illegally obtained $2 million of that money. Jhong used false and fraudulent tax returns, government forms, and other people’s names and documents, including Social Security numbers of individuals who were deceased for over a decade. He spent his ill-gotten gains on personal expenses.
In addition to his prison sentence, Judge Wigenton ordered three years of supervised release and restitution of $2.13 million.

“IRS Criminal Investigation special agents are specially equipped to follow the complex financial trail left by criminals,” Tammy Tomlins, Special Agent in Charge of IRS – Criminal Investigation Newark Field Office. “Let today’s plea serve as a proof of the commitment of IRS-CI and our law enforcement partners dedication to vigorously pursue those who took advantage of government programs intended to provide financial assistance to Americans in need during the COVID-19 pandemic.”
“The CARES Act was created to assist to American citizens and businesses that were impacted financially by the COVID-19 Pandemic,” Christopher A. Nielsen, Inspector in Charge, Philadelphia Division, said. “However, as alleged, Darryl Young, and his co-conspirators, manipulated this critical lifeline through a sophisticated scheme that fraudulently obtained millions of dollars in Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans.  Postal Inspectors will continue to work with the U.S. Attorney’s Office, and our law enforcement partners, to identify and hold accountable, those individuals who steal pandemic relief to fulfill their own greed.”
“Mr. Young admittedly obtained money from the Paycheck Protection Programs intended to assist those with critical needs during the pandemic,” Gail S. Ennis,  Social Security Administration Inspector General, said. “His criminal actions allowed him and his fellow conspirators to selfishly profit. We will continue to collaborate with our law enforcement partners to hold those accountable who misuse Social Security numbers, falsify documents, and fraudulently obtain access to federal benefit programs. I appreciate the collective efforts of the investigating agencies and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for prosecuting this case.”
“Today’s guilty plea sends a clear message that those who fraudulently obtained funds from COVID-19 relief programs will be held accountable,” Special Agent in Charge Patricia Tarasca of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC OIG) said. “The FDIC OIG remains committed to working with our law enforcement partners to investigate and bring to justice those who participate in fraudulent schemes and threaten to undermine the integrity of our Nation’s banking system.”
“Today, Darryl Duanne Young admitted his role in stealing nearly $5 million in relief funds intended to support small businesses impacted by the COVID-19 global pandemic,” Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Newark acting Special Agent in Charge Michael Alfonso said. “This is an egregious case of an individual taking advantage of an unprecedented public health crisis for personal gain. HSI Newark and our law enforcement partners will aggressively pursue those who perpetrate these illicit schemes and see that they are brought to justice.”
According to documents filed in this case and statements made in court:
Young engaged in a scheme to illegally obtain for himself and his conspirators over $4.8 million in loans authorized by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. Young submitted and directed others to submit fraudulent PPP and EIDL loan applications, which fabricated numbers of employees and misrepresented company information, to induce lenders to approve the loan applications that they otherwise would not have approved. Among other things, Young submitted falsified tax documents and bank statements to a victim lender in support of PPP loan applications. Young personally received over $230,000 in PPP loans for businesses he controlled and received a percentage of loan proceeds for assisting in submitting fraudulent applications on behalf of others.
The applications Young submitted each allegedly contained fraudulent representations to the lender – including a victim lender that was a member bank of the Federal Home Loan Bank system – including bogus federal tax documents. According to IRS records, none of the purported tax documents that Young submitted in support of the loan applications were ever in fact filed with the IRS. Based on Young’s misrepresentations, loan applications for his purported businesses and the purported businesses of other applicants were approved for approximately $4.8 million in federal COVID-19 emergency relief funds meant for distressed small businesses.
The charge of conspiracy to commit bank fraud carries a maximum penalty of 30 years in prison and a $1 million fine or twice the gross gain to the defendant or gross loss to the victim, whichever is greatest. The charge of money laundering carries a maximum potential penalty of 10 years in prison and a maximum fine of $250,000 or twice the gross gain to the defendant or gross loss to the victim, whichever is greatest. As part of his guilty plea, Young agreed to make restitution to the victim lenders for the full amount of the fraudulent PPP and EIDL loans.  Sentencing is scheduled for March 18, 2024.

Five Indicted in Scheme to Fraudulently Obtain Bank and Small Business Administration Loans in Property Flipping Scheme,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/five-indicted-scheme-fraudulently-obtain-bank-and-small-business,"November 8, 2023",2023,"Lead Defendant Also Faces a Charge Known as the Financial Crime Kingpin Statute—the First Time the Charge has Ever Been Used in Maryland
Baltimore , Maryland – A federal grand jury has returned an indictment charging five individuals for a fraud scheme intended to obtain over $35 million from financial institutions by providing false documentation in support of SBA loan applications for the purchase of hotels.  Defendant Mehul Ramesh Khatiwala, a/k/a “Mike Khatiwala,” age 41, of Voorhees, New Jersey, also faces a continuing financial crimes enterprise charge, also known as the financial crime kingpin statute—the first time this statute has been charged in Maryland.  The indictment was returned on November 1, 2023.  In addition to Khatiwala, the following defendants are charged in the indictment with bank fraud, making false statements to financial institutions, and money laundering:
Rajendra G. Parikh, age 63, of Monroe, New Jersey; Jennifer H. Watkins, age 47, of Marlton New Jersey; Rebecca Marie Cohn, a/k/a Rebecca Marie Stanton, age 36, of Fallston, Maryland; and Rajnikant I. Patel, age 59, of North Brunswick, New Jersey.
Rajnikant Patel and Jennifer Watkins will have initial appearances on November 9, 2023, at 11:00 a.m. and 11:30 a.m., respectively, in U.S. District Court in Baltimore before U.S. Magistrate Judge A. David Copperthite.  Cohn had her initial appearance on November 6, 2023.  Khatiwala and Parikh had initial appearances in the U.S. District Court in New Jersey on November 3, 2023, and were ordered to be detained.
The indictment was announced by United States Attorney for the District of Maryland Erek L. Barron; Special Agent in Charge Robert Manchak, Federal Housing Finance Agency Office of Inspector General (“FHFA-OIG”); and Special Agent in Charge Jeffrey D. Pittano, Mid-Atlantic Region, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (“FDIC-OIG”).
According to the 31-count indictment, Khatiwala was the owner and managing member of Delaware Hotel Group LLC (“DHG”), and an operator of GMK Consulting LLC (“GMK”) and KPG Hotel Mgmt. LLC (“KPG”), which were hotel management and loan brokerage companies located in Mount Laurel, New Jersey.  Jennifer Watkins was a project coordinator for DHG and managing member of Forza Consulting LLC (“Forza”), a hotel consulting and loan brokerage company located in Marlton, New Jersey.  Rajendra Parkih was an owner of KPG and Rebecca Cohn was a settlement and title processor for Residential Title & Escrow Company (“Residential Title”), a real estate title company located in Owings Mills, Maryland, that offered escrow and loan settlement services.  Rajnikant Patel worked as the manager of a convenience store owned by Parikh and Parikh’s brother.
The indictment alleges that from August 2018 until February 2020 the defendants conspired to obtain loan proceeds for the defendants and others to buy and sell hotels in a hotel flipping scheme by making material misrepresentations and omissions to financial institutions during the loan application process regarding the identity of the sellers, the familial relationships between the parties, and the nature and amount of the equity injected by the borrowers, under the SBA’s Section 7(a) Program.  The SBA’s Section 7(a) Program guaranteed and insured 75 percent to 90 percent of qualified loans made and administered by participating lending institutions and required that the small business owner/borrower invest a certain amount of their own money into the business to qualify for the loan.
Specifically, the indictment alleges that Khatiwala, Parikh, and Watkins created shell companies using Patel and a co-conspirator as the straw owners of the companies, then had the straw owners sign purchase contracts, operating agreements, and related documents to buy hotel properties in the names of the shell companies created by Khatiwala, Parikh, and Watkins, while at the same time soliciting investors, including family members, and creating other companies to serve as buying entities (the “Buyers”) so they could quickly resell the hotels at a much higher price.
As detailed in the indictment, Khatiwala, Parikh, Watkins, and Cohn collected, compiled, and submitted documentation needed by financial institutions to determine whether the Buyers qualified for the SBA loans, including records proving that the Buyers provided sufficient cash upfront to satisfy SBA’s equity injection requirements for Section 7(a) funding, such as checks, bank statements, and wire transfer records.  Cohn maintained the equity injection funds in designated Residential Title escrow accounts pending the loan settlements and kept ledgers to track the use of those escrow funds.
The indictment alleges that Khatiwala, Parikh, Watkins and Cohn: fraudulently diverted some of the Buyers’ equity injections to make down payments on hotels that were under contract to shell companies controlled by Khatiwala and Parikh; submitted the same wire transfer records and gift letters as support for equity injections that had been already been used to satisfy the buyer’s equity injection obligations for other SBA loan applications; and fraudulently submitted falsified bank statements and wire transfers to satisfy the equity injections.
The indictment also alleges that the defendants engaged in roundtrip transactions, whereby they falsely represented to financial institutions that over $1.5 million on deposit in a Residential Title escrow account would be used to satisfy the Buyer’s equity injection obligations, when, the indictment alleges, the funds were temporarily withdrawn from that account prior to the loan closings and redeposited back into the same escrow account subsequent to the loan closings.
Further, the indictment alleges that Khatiwala, Parikh, Watkins, and Cohn falsely represented to financial institutions that the buying entities had purchased the hotels from the shell companies when, in fact, the shell companies had not yet owned the properties.  Khatiwala, Parikh, Watkins, and Cohn diverted loan proceeds intended for the buyers to purchase hotels from the shell companies so that the shell companies could first purchase the property and then flip it to the buyer.
If convicted, Khatiwala faces a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years and up to life in prison for a continuing financial crime enterprise.  All of the defendants face a maximum of 30 years in federal prison for the conspiracy to commit bank fraud and for each count of bank fraud; a maximum of 5 years in federal prison for a conspiracy to make a false statement to a financial institution.  Khatiwala, Parikh, Watkins, and Cohn also face a maximum of 30 years in federal prison for each count of making a false statement a financial institution and a maximum of 10 years in federal prison for conspiracy to launder money and for each count of money laundering.  Actual sentences for federal crimes are typically less than the maximum penalties. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after taking into account the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.
An indictment is not a finding of guilt.  An individual charged by indictment is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty at some later criminal proceedings.
United States Attorney Erek L. Barron commended the FHFA-OIG and FDIC-OIG for their work in the investigation.  Mr. Barron thanked Assistant U.S. Attorneys Martin J. Clarke, and Harry M. Gruber, who are prosecuting the federal case.

Southern Pine Credit Union President and Controller Plead Guilty to Bank Fraud,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/southern-pine-credit-union-president-and-controller-plead-guilty,"November 2, 2023",2023,"VALDOSTA, Ga. – The former President and the former Controller of Southern Pine Credit Union in Valdosta both pleaded guilty to long-running multimillion-dollar bank loan and aggravated identity theft schemes.
Teresa Paulo, of Valdosta, pleaded guilty to one count of bank fraud and one count of aggravated identity theft today. Co-defendant Leah Lehman, 63, of Valdosta, pleaded guilty to one count of bank fraud and one count of aggravated identity theft on Oct. 26. Both women face a maximum of 30 years in prison for bank fraud, and a mandatory two years in prison in addition to any other prison term imposed for aggravated identity theft, to be followed by a maximum of five years of supervised release and a $1,000,000 fine.
U.S. District Judge W. Louis Sands is presiding over this case. Lehman’s sentencing date is scheduled for Feb. 28, 2024. Paulo’s sentencing date will be determined by the Court. The defendants are not eligible for parole.
“As leaders of this credit union, the defendants knowingly put their members—local paper mill employees and their families—at great risk with their complex schemes to enrich themselves,” said U.S. Attorney Peter D. Leary. “I want to thank the FBI and FDIC investigators for unraveling their carefully engineered criminal fraud and helping us hold them accountable.”
“These guilty pleas are the direct result of a diligent investigation by hardworking FBI employees and our partners at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation,” said Rich Bilson, Senior Supervisory Resident Agent of FBI Atlanta’s Valdosta office. “Paulo and Lehman’s greed driven scheme stole hundreds of thousands of dollars and damaged the financial security of innocent victims. They will now be held accountable for their blatant misuse of the power of their positions.”
According to court documents, Lehman served as President of Southern Pine Credit Union (SPCU) in Valdosta from 1990 to 2020. Paolo was SPCU’s controller from Oct. 2011 to June 2020. The Credit Union’s members are employees of the local paper mill and their families. Lehman and Paolo were both authorized to originate all types of loans, were responsible for filing quarterly reports to the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) and had access to all SPCU employees’ usernames and passwords for all SPCU computers and software.
Lehman began her fraud in June 2003, when she created a share secured loan in a SPCU account using the name and social security number of a member without that individual’s knowledge. From Feb. 2012 to May 31, 2020, Lehman paid off the loan and rebooked it multiple times with additional advances. She would take the proceeds and put them in a joint share draft account she had with the individual, using the proceeds to pay for a boat, a hunting club share, personal expenses and gifts to family members. This loan was repaid in full. However, Lehman created another share secured loan in another individual’s name without their knowledge and would also pay off the loan and rebook it multiple times for personal spending. To conceal these activities, Lehman created false credit transactions using the names and passwords of SPCU employees. These transactions would advance the due date on the loans, which prevented these loans from appearing on quarterly call reports to the NCUA and allowed Lehman to defer or not make payment on these loans. Following these transactions, Lehman created debit entries to put the loans back on the accounts, which would often include interest accrued on the outstanding loans. She made additional fraudulent loan advances simultaneously with those entries to advance the loan dates. She reflected the loans as being paid off at the end of the quarter to prevent possible detection of artificial growth in the SPCU loan portfolio. In total, the drafts needed to pay off the loan balances at each quarter grew to $4,112,870.63, excluding payments and interest, as of May 31, 2020.
Paulo committed a similar fraud scheme to Lehman. In Oct. 2011, Paulo created a share secured loan in a SPCU account using the name and social security number of a member without that individual’s knowledge. From Nov. 2011 until May 29, 2020, Paulo took out additional advances on the loan as well as additional loans from the account. Paulo would transfer the loan proceeds into a joint account for personal spending purposes. She created another share secured account using the personal identity of another individual and would pay off the loan and rebook it multiple times with additional advances, using the proceeds for her own personal expenses or electronically transfer money into her family’s accounts. Paulo concealed her schemes as Lehman concealed hers: creating false credit transactions using the usernames and passwords of SPCU employees to simulate the payoff of the loans, which would advance the due date on the loans. Paulo also created debit entries using other people’s usernames and passwords to put the loans back on the accounts, which would often include interest accrued on the outstanding loans. The drafts needed to pay off the loan balances at each quarter grew to $1,233,201.77, excluding payments and interest, as of May 31, 2020. Paulo made $7,736.16 in legitimate payments to the loan balances.
The case was investigated by the FBI and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).
Assistant U.S. Attorney Hannah Couch is prosecuting this case for the Government.

Bank Insider Charged with Accepting Bribes to Facilitate Millions of Dollars of Money Laundering,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/bank-insider-charged-accepting-bribes-facilitate-millions,"October 30, 2023",2023,"NEWARK, NJ. – A New Jersey-based employee of an international financial institution was arrested today for accepting bribes to facilitate millions of dollars of money laundering, U.S. Attorney Philip R. Sellinger announced.
Oscar Marcelo Nunez-Flores, 32, of North Plainfield, New Jersey, is charged by complaint with one count of money laundering conspiracy and one count of accepting bribes as an employee of a financial institution. He appeared before U.S. Magistrate Judge James B. Clark III in Newark federal court and was released on $150,000 unsecured bond.
“As alleged, Nunez corruptly exploited his position inside a bank to help launder millions of dollars in drug money in exchange for bribes. Today’s arrest shows that my office will expose and prosecute those who abuse positions of trust and seek to corrupt our financial institutions.”
U.S. Attorney Philp R. Sellinger
“The DEA will continue to work diligently to pursue and dismantle all elements from Drug Trafficking Organizations,” Special Agent in Charge for the DEA Caribbean Division Denise Foster said. “Money launderers help drug trafficking organizations flourish and poison our communities. We will continue to allocate all our law enforcement resources to make a greater impact in vulnerable areas where criminal organizations dedicated to drug trafficking are causing greater damage.”
“IRS - Criminal Investigation and our law enforcement partners will continue to work together to hold accountable and disrupt bad actors like the defendant, who allegedly accepted bribes to facilitate millions of dollars of money laundering,” Tammy Tomlins, Special Agent in Charge of IRS - Criminal Investigation Newark Field Office, said. “We are committed to protecting the integrity of our financial institutions by investigating and prosecuting individuals involved in financial crimes.”
According to documents filed in this case and statements made in court:
Nunez works for an international financial institution, at a branch located in Scotch Plains, New Jersey. Starting in early 2022, Nunez exploited his position as a bank employee to facilitate money laundering activities in exchange for bribes. Nunez used his position and inside access to open bank accounts in the names of shell companies with nominee owners. Those accounts were then used to launder narcotics proceeds, including to Colombia. Nunez assisted the money laundering efforts by giving those who bribed him online access to the accounts, along with dozens of debit cards for the accounts that were later used to withdraw cash from ATMs in Colombia. Nunez received thousands of dollars in bribes for each account he opened.  The investigation has revealed that millions of dollars were laundered to Colombia through accounts opened by Nunez since early 2022.
The charge of money laundering conspiracy carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and a fine of $500,000 or twice the amount involved in the offense, whichever is greater. The charge of bank bribery carries a maximum penalty of 30 years in prison and a fine of $1 million, or three times the value of the thing given, whichever is greater.
U.S. Attorney Sellinger credited special agents and task force officers of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), under the direction of Special Agents in Charge Denise Foster in San Juan, Puerto Rico, David F. Reames in Seattle, Washington, and Cheryl Ortiz in Newark; special agents and task force officers of IRS – Criminal Investigation, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Tammy Tomlins in Newark; and special agents of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation – Office of Inspector General, New York Division, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Patricia Tarasca, with the investigation leading to the charges. He also thanked the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Washington for their assistance in the investigation.
The government is represented by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Mark J. Pesce of the Economic Crimes Unit and Angelica Sinopole of the Health Care Fraud Unit in Newark and Trial Attorneys D. Zachary Adams, Chad Davis, and Chelsea Rooney of the Justice Department’s Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Daniel J. Olinghouse (District of Puerto Rico) and Vince Lombardi (Western District of Washington) also assisted with the investigation.
The charges and allegations contained in the complaint are merely accusations, and the defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.

Loan Brokers and Bank Loan Officer Sentenced for Bank Fraud Scheme,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/loan-brokers-and-bank-loan-officer-sentenced-bank-fraud-scheme,"October 20, 2023",2023,"Defendants charged borrowers fees for fraudulent loan applications they submitted using fabricated information
BOSTON – Two operators of a loan brokerage business and a loan officer at a Massachusetts-based bank were sentenced today for conspiring to defraud a bank and the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA).
Ted Capodilupo, 58, of South Easton; Joseph Masci, 72, of Boston; and Brian Ferris, 45, of Braintree, were each sentenced by U.S. Senior District Court Judge Mark L. Wolf to one year and one day in prison and two years of supervised release. Additionally, Capodilupo and Masci were each ordered to pay restitution of $1,424,087 and Ferris was ordered to pay restitution of $1,236,251. The defendants previously pleaded guilty to one count each of conspiracy to commit bank fraud.
Between 2015 and 2018, Capodilupo, Masci and Ferris agreed to defraud a bank and the SBA by submitting fraudulent loan applications to the bank, which administered the SBA’s small business express loan program, to secure bank loans guaranteed by the SBA. Specifically, Capodilupo and Masci submitted dozens of fraudulent loan applications on behalf of borrowers who were ineligible for traditional business loans. These loan applications misrepresented, among other things, the identity of the real loan recipients and the businesses for which the loans were sought.
Capodilupo and Masci also falsified applicant signatures and falsely indicated that no broker had assisted in preparing or referring the loan applications, when they in fact charged borrowers excessive fees for obtaining these fraudulent loans. Ferris, who worked as a loan officer at the bank, processed the fraudulent loan applications and in some cases fabricated federal tax forms in support of the applications. Ferris caused the bank to issue loans for which Capodilupo and Masci submitted applications and received a kickback from Capodilupo and Masci of approximately $500 per loan. The scheme generated approximately $270,000 in fees for Capodilupo and Masci. Many of the loans that the bank issued as a result of the fraudulent applications ultimately defaulted, resulting in substantial losses to the bank.
Acting United States Attorney Joshua S. Levy; Patricia Tarasca, Special Agent in Charge of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC-OIG), New York Region; Jodi Cohen, Special Agent in Charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Boston Division; Brian Tucker, Special Agent-in-Charge, Eastern Region, Office of Inspector General for the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection; and Amaleka McCall-Brathwaite, Special Agent in Charge of SBA OIG’s Eastern Region made the announcement.

"Former Florida State Representative Sentenced To Federal Prison For Wire Fraud, Money Laundering, And Making False Statements In Connection With COVID-19 Relief Fraud",https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/former-florida-state-representative-sentenced-federal-prison,"October 19, 2023",2023,"GAINESVILLE, FLORIDA – Joseph Harding, 36, of Williston, Florida, was sentenced to 4 months in federal prison for wire fraud, money laundering, and making false statements in connection with COVID-19 relief fraud. The sentence was announced by Jason R. Coody, United States Attorney for the Northern District of Florida.
“The theft of any amount of taxpayer funds is inexcusable,” said U.S. Attorney Coody. “However, the defendant’s deceptive acts of diverting emergency financial assistance from small businesses during the pandemic is simply beyond the pale. Today’s sentence both punishes the defendant’s criminal conduct and should serve as a significant deterrent to others who would selfishly steal from their fellow citizens to unlawfully enrich themselves. With our law enforcement partners, we remain committed to investigating and prosecuting those who engage in acts of COVID-19 related fraud.”
Court documents reflect Harding participated in a scheme to defraud the Small Business Administration (SBA) and obtained a coronavirus-related small business loan by means of materially false and fraudulent pretenses, representations, and promises, and while executing such scheme, caused wire communications to be transmitted in interstate commerce. Harding also made a false and fraudulent SBA Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) application, in the name of one of his dormant business entities, that he submitted to the SBA.  By this conduct, Harding fraudulently obtained $150,000 in COVID-19 relief funds from the SBA to which he was not entitled.  After obtaining the EIDL proceeds, Harding conducted three monetary transactions each involving more than $10,000 in fraudulently obtained funds: a transfer to his joint bank account, a payment to his credit card, and a transfer into a bank account of a third-party business entity.
""Mr. Harding egregiously betrayed the public trust by stealing from COVID relief funds meant to help the very people who elected him.,” said Special Agent in Charge Brian J. Payne, IRS Criminal Investigation, Tampa Field Office. “Greed and public service should never meet, but when they do, we stand ready to ensure bad actors are held responsible for their actions.”
“Today, Mr. Harding was held accountable for swindling money out of COVID-19 relief programs created to help small businesses, including Mr. Harding’s own constituents, recover from the economic hardships of the pandemic,” said Special Agent in Charge Kyle A. Myles of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC OIG). “The FDIC OIG will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to bring to justice anyone who steals from such programs and threatens to undermine the integrity of our Nation’s financial institutions.”
Harding’s imprisonment will be followed by two years of supervised release.
“SBA OIG will follow the evidence to root out fraud in SBA’s pandemic response programs and bring wrongdoers to justice,” said SBA OIG’s Eastern Region Special Agent-in-Charge Amaleka McCall-Brathwaite. “This sentence demonstrates there is significant consequence for fraudulently accessing SBA programs to steal from taxpayers. I want to thank the U.S. Attorney’s office and our law enforcement partners for their support and dedication to pursuing justice in this case.”
“Mr. Harding abused a program that was designed to ease the suffering of the constituents who elected him to serve in their best interests,” says Sherri E. Onks, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Jacksonville Division.  “Instead of using thousands of dollars in federal funds to help keep struggling businesses afloat and honest workers employed, he selfishly diverted it for his own personal gain.  The FBI will hold accountable anyone who takes advantage of those in need, and we remain committed to working with our partners to ensure fraudsters are brought to justice.”
The conviction jointly conducted by the Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigation, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) Office of Inspector General, the Small Business Administration (SBA) Office of Inspector General, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The case was prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys Justin M. Keen and David P. Byron.
The PPP, administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration (“SBA”), was designed to provide low-interest, forgivable loans to applicants to help fund certain permissible expenses for qualifying businesses amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, which included payroll costs, interest on mortgages, rent, and utilities.  The EIDL program, also administered by the SBA, was designed to provide low-interest loans to small businesses in regions affected by declared disasters. The CARES Act authorized the SBA to provide EIDLs, up to $2 million, to eligible small businesses experiencing substantial financial disruption due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
This case was prosecuted as part the Department of Justice’s prosecution of fraud schemes that exploit the CARES Act relief programs. The CARES Act is a federal law enacted in March 2020, designed to provide emergency financial assistance to the millions of Americans suffering the economic effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. One of the two programs that were developed through CARES Act is the PPP. It provides funding to businesses through PPP loans for payroll costs, interest on mortgages, rent and utilities. PPP allows the interest and principal on loans to be forgiven if the business spends proceeds on certain expense items within a designated time and uses a certain percentage of the loan on payroll expenses. The Department of Justice remains vigilant in detecting, investigating, and prosecuting wrongdoing related to the crisis.

Former Chairman of 1 Global Pleads Guilty to Running $250 Million Securities Fraud Scheme,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/former-chairman-1-global-pleads-guilty-running-250-million,"October 13, 2023",2023,"MIAMI – Carl R. Ruderman, 82, former chairman of 1 Global Capital LLC (“1 Global”) pled guilty yesterday to a $250 million securities fraud scheme. Four of Ruderman’s co-conspirators have already pleaded guilty for their role in this fraud, including two lawyers who provided him with false legal cover to skirt federal securities laws.
Ruderman pled guilty to conspiracy to commit securities fraud, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 371. In his plea agreement, Ruderman agreed to a sentence of 5 years, the statutory maximum, and to a forfeiture money judgment of over $250 million.
1 Global was a commercial lending business based in Hallandale Beach, Florida, that made the equivalent of “pay day” loans to small businesses at high interest rates, termed merchant cash advance loans (“MCAs”). Ruderman was the chairman of 1 Global.
Ruderman admitted that he and others made false and misleading representations to investors and potential investors as to the profitability of 1 Global’s business in marketing materials and periodic account statements. According to plea documents, investors were falsely told that 1 Global had audited financials by a public accounting firm, that the investor’s money would be spent on the MCAs, and that they could expect double-digit returns on their investments, among other things.
Ruderman admitted that he spent 1 Global’s investor’s money on credit card payments, vacation travel, insurance payments for his art collection and valuable jewelry, drivers, nannies, housekeepers, mortgage payments for his house, tuition, and payments for a luxury car. Ruderman also admitted that he diverted 1 Global investor money to businesses benefitting him and his family, without the investors’ knowledge.
Questions arose during the operation of the business as to whether 1 Global was offering or selling a security and whether the investment offering was required to be registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Ruderman admitted in plea documents that he knew that if 1 Global’s investment offering were determined to be a security, it would undermine the ability of 1 Global to raise funds from retail investors and to continue to operate without substantial additional expenses and reporting requirements. Ruderman also admitted that he directed a lawyer, Jan Atlas, to author two opinion letters in 2016 containing false information that allowed 1 Global to skirt federal securities laws.
Four of Ruderman’s co-conspirators pleaded guilty for their roles in the fraud.
Alan G. Heide, 65, of Lake Worth, Florida, the former 1 Global chief financial officer, pleaded to a single count information, charging him with one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud (case no. 19-cr-60231), and was sentenced to 60 months in prison by U.S. District Judge Roy K. Altman. Judge Altman also ordered Heide to pay over $57 million in restitution to the victims of the scheme.
Andrew Dale Ledbetter, 81, of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud and securities fraud (case no. 20-cr-60103), and was sentenced by Judge Altman to 60 months in prison. Judge Altman also ordered Ledbetter to pay over $148 million to the victims of the scheme.
Steven Allen Schwartz, 78, of Delray Beach, Florida, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud and securities fraud (case no. 20-cr-60003), and was sentenced to 24 months in prison by Judge Altman. Judge Altman also ordered Schwartz to pay over $36 million in restitution to the victims of the scheme.
Jan Douglas Atlas, 78, of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud and securities fraud (case no. 19-cr-60258), and was sentenced to eight months in prison by Judge Altman. Judge Altman also ordered Atlas to pay over $29 million in restitution to the victims of the scheme.
1 Global filed for bankruptcy on July 27, 2018. As of that time, according to documents from related cases, 1 Global had more than 3,400 investors and had raised more than $250 million during the scheme. The bankruptcy case, In re: 1 Global Capital LLC, et al., No. 18-19121-RBR (S.D. Fla.), remains pending.
The SEC previously filed civil fraud actions related to the 1 Global Fraud, captioned, SEC v. 1 Global Capital LLC and Carl C. Ruderman, Case No. 18-61991-CV-BB (S.D. Fla.); SEC v. Alan G.

CEO Pleads Guilty to Transnational Scheme Involving Foreign Exchange and Cryptocurrency Futures Contracts,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/ceo-pleads-guilty-transnational-scheme-involving-foreign,"October 12, 2023",2023,"First Criminal Charge Against a Commodities Trading Advisor and Commodities Pool Operator for Engaging in a “Cherry-Picking” Scheme Involving Cryptocurrency Futures Contracts
A former chief executive officer of an investment firm pleaded guilty yesterday to a “cherry-picking” scheme, in which he fraudulently misappropriated profitable trades to himself, and saddled his investors with losses.
According to court documents, Peter Kambolin, 48, a U.S.-Russian national of Sunny Isles Beach, Florida, was the owner and chief executive officer of Systematic Alpha Management LLC (SAM), an investment firm that Kambolin marketed as offering algorithmic trading strategies involving futures contracts. Between January 2019 and November 2021, Kambolin, who at the time was a commodity trading advisor and a commodity pool operator, engaged in a cherry-picking scheme in which he fraudulently allocated profits and losses from futures trades in a manner designed to benefit his own accounts unfairly at the expense of his clients. Kambolin also misrepresented to his clients that SAM employed trading strategies focused on cryptocurrency futures contracts and foreign exchange futures contracts, when in reality, approximately half of Kambolin’s trading in each pool involved equity index futures contracts. In doing so, Kambolin defrauded investors located in the United States and abroad by, among other things, depriving them of profitable trades. Kambolin used the proceeds of the scheme to fund personal expenses, including rent for a beachfront apartment, and transferred proceeds to foreign bank accounts his co-coconspirator controlled in Belarus and Dominica.
“The defendant breached client trust for personal profit,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. “This conduct undermines investor confidence in the commodities markets. This plea demonstrates that the Justice Department will not allow financial advisors to place their self-interest ahead of clients, including by cherry-picking trades. It also underscores the Justice Department’s commitment to using data analytics to prosecute wrongdoing in the financial markets.”
During the relevant period, Kambolin executed trades for pool participants together with trades he executed on behalf of his proprietary accounts, and fraudulently allocated the profits and losses of the trades to benefit his own accounts.
“Yesterday’s plea recognizes the importance of holding the defendant accountable for his actions in misleading and defrauding investors through a cherry-picking scheme, and using proceeds from the scheme to fund his own personal lifestyle,” said Assistant Inspector General for Investigations Shimon R. Richmond of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC-OIG). “The FDIC-OIG remains committed to working with our law enforcement partners to protect investors and the nation’s banking system from individuals who commit such egregious financial crimes.”
Kambolin pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit commodities fraud. He faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison. A sentencing date has not yet been set. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.
The FDIC-OIG is investigating the case. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission previously charged Kambolin and SAM by complaint .

DC Solar Attorney Indicted in the DC Solar Billion Dollar Ponzi Scheme,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/dc-solar-attorney-indicted-dc-solar-billion-dollar-ponzi-scheme,"October 10, 2023",2023,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. — On Oct. 5, 2023, a federal grand jury returned a 23‑count indictment against Ari J. Lauer, 59, of Lafayette, charging him with conspiracy to commit wire and bank fraud, bank fraud, and wire fraud affecting a financial institution, for his role in the biggest criminal fraud scheme in the history of the Eastern District of California, U.S. Attorney Phillip A. Talbert announced.
Lauer is an attorney licensed to practice law in California, and from approximately 2009 to January 2019, he was outside counsel to DC Solar and provided legal and business advice concerning DC Solar’s operations. The indictment was unsealed today following Lauer’s arrest.
According to court documents, between 2011 and 2018, DC Solar manufactured mobile solar generators that were mounted on trailers. The company touted the versatility and environmental sustainability of the generators and claimed that they were used to provide emergency power to cellphone towers and lighting at sporting and other events. A significant incentive for investors were generous federal tax credits due to the solar nature of the generators. Jeff Carpoff, 52, Paulette Carpoff, 49, both of Martinez, and their co-conspirators solicited investors to invest in the generators in large multimillion-dollar transactions using a variety of fraudulent techniques.
A key part of the fraud was that investors would never actually take possession of the generators. Instead, DC Solar typically leased those generators back from the investors, and claimed to sublease them to third parties to generate revenue. In reality there was very little actual third-party rental demand for the generators, yet when Lauer and the other co-conspirators learned this, they continued to represent falsely to investors that the rental market for the generators was robust.
In June 2012, Lauer, Jeff Carpoff, and others met to discuss the failure to generate third-party lease revenue sufficient to meet their financial obligations to the investors. The conspirators agreed to conceal that lack of third-party lease revenue from current and prospective investors, by, among other things, making periodic transfers of investor money from one account to another while misrepresenting the flow of funds as third-party lease revenue. Lauer and other members of the conspiracy created a circular payment system they referred to as “re-rent.” In 2014, they created a “re-rent agreement,” backdating the document to 2011, and used it to explain the large sums of money being transferred from one account to another. In fact, the real source of money was new investor money, which was being used to pay obligations to existing investors. The indictment further alleges that Lauer and other members of the conspiracy prepared sublease agreements with “concealed addendums” that materially altered the terms of the contracts. They used the sublease agreements to defraud investors.
Between March 2011 and Dec. 18, 2018, investors collectively invested approximately $759,400,000 and several financial institutions and other investors transferred collectively $152,700,000 to DC Solar as part of related transactions for the purchase and lease of generators. In total, DC Solar closed transactions with investors that contributed an aggregate of more than $912 million to purchase generators. Those transactions purportedly involved approximately 17,000 generators, at approximately $2.5 billion in purported value.
During the conspiracy, approximately 94% to 95% of the supposed lease revenue on the books was actually intercompany transfers disguised as new investor money. In truth, third-party end-user demand for generators never exceeded 5% of the revenue that was claimed.
This case is the product of an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, IRS Criminal Investigation, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General. Assistant U.S. Attorney Audrey Hemesath is prosecuting the case.
On Nov. 9, 2021, Jeff Carpoff was sentenced to 30 years in prison and ordered to pay $790,600,000 in restitution for conspiracy to commit wire fraud and money laundering. His wife Paulette Carpoff pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit an offense against the United States and money laundering. She was sentenced on June 28, 2022, to 11 years and three months in prison.
On Nov. 16, 2021, Joseph W. Bayliss, 48, of Martinez, was sentenced to three years in prison and ordered to pay $481,300,000 in restitution for securities fraud and conspiracy in connection with the DC Solar scheme. On April 12, 2022, DC Solar CFO Robert A. Karmann, 57, of Clayton, was sentenced to six years in prison and ordered to pay $624 million. On May 31, 2022, Alan Hansen was sentenced to eight years in prison for conspiracy to commit an offense against the United States and aiding and abetting money laundering. Ryan Guidry, 48, of Pleasant Hill, was sentenced on Jan. 31, 2023, to six years and six months in prison and ordered to pay $619,415,950 in restitution for to conspiracy to commit an offense against the United States and aiding and abetting money laundering.
Ronald J. Roach, 55, of Walnut Creek, pleaded guilty to criminal offenses related to the fraud scheme and is scheduled to be sentenced on Nov. 14, 2023. Roach faces a maximum statutory penalty of 10 years prison. The actual sentence, however, will be determined at the discretion of the court after consideration of any applicable statutory factors and the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, which take into account a number of variables.

Leader of $20M COVID-19 Relief Fraud Ring Sentenced to 15 Years,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/leader-20m-covid-19-relief-fraud-ring-sentenced-15-years,"October 3, 2023",2023,"Six Other Individuals Sentenced in One of the Largest Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) Fraud Cases Prosecuted by the Justice Department
The head of a multimillion-dollar COVID-19 relief fraud ring and six of his co-conspirators were sentenced for fraudulently obtaining more than $20 million in forgivable Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans that the Small Business Administration (SBA) guaranteed under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.
According to court documents, Amir Aqeel, 54, of Houston, was sentenced yesterday to 15 years in prison and ordered to forfeit $5,583,111.48 for leading the conspiracy, and for conspiring with at least 14 other individuals to submit 75 fraudulent PPP loan applications in 2020. In the applications, the defendants falsified the number of employees and the average monthly payroll expenses of the applicant businesses and submitted fraudulent bank records and fake federal tax forms in support of the PPP loan applications. Aqeel paid some of the defendants large kickbacks in exchange for their assistance with the false and fraudulent PPP loan applications.
“During a time of unprecedented national peril, these defendants took advantage of a pandemic and stole millions of dollars in federal funds intended to help businesses keep their employees paid and their doors open,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Nicole M. Argentieri of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. “The sentences demonstrate that the Department and law enforcement have and will continue to hold individuals accountable for committing fraud on the government.”
“I salute the prosecutors and agents who exposed this fraud ring, brought these defendants to justice, and worked to return stolen funds to the American people,” said Director of COVID-19 Fraud Enforcement Michael Galdo of the Justice Department. “The Department will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to bring those who committed pandemic benefit fraud to justice and use all appropriate tools to recover stolen pandemic relief funds.”
“Amir Aqeel engaged in one of the largest PPP conspiracies in the country,” said U.S. Attorney Alamdar S. Hamdani for the Southern District of Texas. “He and his cohorts stole millions from the public fund, using that money to buy houses, a Porsche, even a Lamborghini, all while taking advantage of programs intended to help those struggling during the pandemic. These sentences send a strong message to scammers looking for a quick and easy buck in the Southern District of Texas; you need to look elsewhere.”
The defendants also laundered a portion of the fraudulent proceeds by writing checks from companies that received PPP loans to fake employees. The defendants cashed these fake paychecks at Fascare International Inc., dba Almeda Discount Store (Almeda), a company that Siddiq Azeemuddin owned. In total, the defendants cashed more than 1,100 fake paychecks for more than $3 million in fraudulent PPP loan proceeds at Almeda.
“SBA-OIG will aggressively root out bad actors in SBA’s pandemic response programs and bring them to justice,” said Special Agent in Charge Brady Ipock of the SBA Office of Inspector General (SBA-OIG) Central Region. “These sentences demonstrate there are significant consequences for conspiring to fraudulently access SBA programs and steal from taxpayers. I want to thank the U.S. Attorney’s office and our law enforcement partners for their support and dedication to pursuing justice in this case.”
“One unfortunate aspect of the pandemic relief programs has been how many people and institutions, including the Federal Home Loan Banks, were negatively affected by unscrupulous criminals who targeted a program meant to help all Americans at a critical time,” said Special Agent in Charge Catherine Huber of the Federal Housing Finance Agency Office of Inspector General’s (FHFA-OIG) Central Region. “We are proud to work with our partner agencies to investigate and stamp out these schemes.”
“While the rest of our country was reeling from the effects of an unprecedented global health crisis, these individuals conspired to fraudulently obtain and launder millions of taxpayer dollars from an emergency fund that was intended to help keep struggling businesses and employees afloat,” said Special Agent in Charge Mark Dawson of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Houston. “Working in conjunction with our federal law enforcement partners, we were able to uncover their scheme and hold them accountable for exploiting these government programs for their own profit.”
Federal agents also executed 45 seizure warrants in conjunction with the case and have seized, among other items, a residence, a Porsche, and a Lamborghini purchased with illegally obtained funds.
“Today, Aqeel and six of his co-conspirators in this case were brought to justice for their roles in a fraudulent scheme that swindled millions of dollars from the Paycheck Protection Program, which was created to assist struggling businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Special Agent in Charge Anand Ramlall of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC-OIG) Dallas Region. “The FDIC-OIG, working with our law enforcement partners, will continue to pursue and hold accountable those who took advantage of these programs and threatened to undermine the integrity of our nation’s banking system.”
“The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration continues to aggressively pursue those who endeavor to defraud programs afforded to the American people under the CARES Act,” said Special Agent in Charge Gary Smith of the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) Gulf States Field Division. “We appreciate the efforts of the Justice Department and our law enforcement partners in this effort.”
Five others had previously pleaded guilty and were sentenced today for their roles in the loan fraud scheme. Khalid Abbas, 57, and Rifat Bajwa, 54, both of Richmond, Texas, were sentenced to two and a half years and three years in prison, respectively. Azeemuddin, 44, of Naperville, Illinois, was sentenced to two years in prison. Pardeep Basra, 54, of Houston, was sentenced to three years and five months in prison. Richard Reuth, 60, of Spring, Texas, was sentenced to two and a half years in prison.
In February, a federal jury convicted Abdul Fatani, 57, of Richmond, Texas, of one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, one count of wire fraud, and one count of money laundering. He was sentenced today to three years in prison.
The SBA-OIG, FHFA-OIG, HSI, FDIC-OIG, and TIGTA are investigating the cases.

Florida Man Sentenced for $2.5 Million COVID-Relief Fraud,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/florida-man-sentenced-25-million-covid-relief-fraud,"September 27, 2023",2023,"Defendant used funds to buy real estate, cars and to invest in cryptocurrency
BOSTON – A former Massachusetts resident was sentenced today in connection with filing fraudulent applications to obtain $2.5 million in Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan funds made available under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act.
Vinicius Santana, 35, of Boca Raton, Fla. and formerly of Revere, Mass. was sentenced by U.S. District Court Chief Judge F. Dennis Saylor IV to 29 months in prison and three years of supervised release. Santana was also ordered to pay restitution of $2.5 million and forfeiture. In September 2022, Santana pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud and one count of unlawful monetary transactions.
Santana owned Complete Home Care, LLC (CHC), a painting company in Massachusetts. In April 2020, Santana submitted several different PPP loan applications on behalf of CHC. In the initial applications, Santana listed five employees and an average monthly payroll of between $10,000 and $18,000. These applications were denied. In the fourth application for CHC, Santana falsely claimed to have 154 employees and an average monthly payroll of $1 million. On May 11, 2020, a bank issued Santana’s company a $2.5 million loan based on the false representations in the fourth application.
After receiving the funds, Santana misused the loan proceeds to buy real estate and cars and to invest in cryptocurrency.
The CARES Act is a federal law enacted on March 29, 2020, designed to provide emergency financial assistance to the millions of Americans who are suffering the economic effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Two Real Estate Developers Convicted of Conspiring to Embezzle Millions From the Failed Washington Federal Bank in Chicago,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/two-real-estate-developers-convicted-conspiring-embezzle,"September 25, 2023",2023,"CHICAGO — A federal jury in Chicago has convicted two real estate developers of participating in a conspiracy that embezzled millions of dollars from the failed Washington Federal Bank for Savings in Chicago.
Washington Federal, which was based in Chicago’s Bridgeport neighborhood, was shut down in 2017 after the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency determined that the bank was insolvent and had at least $66 million in nonperforming loans.  For more than a decade, developers MIROSLAW KREJZA and MAREK MATCZUK were part of a conspiracy that embezzled millions of dollars in bank funds.  The embezzled funds were disguised as purported real estate development loan disbursements to Krejza, Matczuk, and others.  The conspirators were not required to repay these purported loans, and they never did.
Krejza, 65, of Chicago, and Matczuk, 60, of Park Ridge, Ill., were convicted Friday of conspiring to commit embezzlement and falsify bank records, as well as aiding and abetting embezzlement by bank employees.  The jury returned the verdicts after a three-week trial in federal court in Chicago.  U.S. District Judge Virginia M. Kendall did not immediately set sentencing dates.
The convictions were announced by Morris Pasqual, Acting United States Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois; Vincent R. Zehme, Special Agent-in-Charge of the Chicago Region of the FDIC’s Office of Inspector General; Machelle L. Jindra, Special Agent-in-Charge of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's Office of Inspector General in Chicago; Justin Campbell, Special Agent-in-Charge of IRS Criminal Investigation in Chicago; Catherine Huber, Special Agent-in-Charge of the Central Region of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, Office of Inspector General; Robert W. “Wes” Wheeler, Jr., Special Agent-in-Charge of the Chicago Field Office of the FBI; Andrea Peacock, Special Agent-in-Charge of the Department of the Treasury, Office of Inspector General; Deborah Witzburg, City of Chicago Inspector General; and Kathryn B.

The federal investigation into the collapse of Washington Federal led to criminal charges against 16 defendants, including the bank’s Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer, and other high-ranking employees, for conspiring to embezzle at least $31 million in bank funds.   Krejza, Matczuk, and two others were convicted after jury trials, while ten defendants pleaded guilty and two entered into deferred prosecution agreements.
Much of the embezzled money was transferred to Chicago attorney ROBERT M. KOWALSKI and other individuals outside the bank without all of the required documentation and often without any documentation whatsoever.  A jury earlier this year convicted Robert Kowalski on bankruptcy fraud, bank embezzlement, and false statement charges.  His sentencing is set for Jan. 23, 2024.   Robert Kowalski’s sister, JAN R. KOWALSKI, also an attorney, pleaded guilty and was sentenced in June to more than three years in prison for fraudulently enabling her brother to conceal more than $357,000 from creditors and the trustee in his bankruptcy case.
Last month, three former members of Washington Federal’s Board of Directors pleaded guilty to conspiring to falsify bank records to deceive the OCC.  WILLIAM M. MAHON, GEORGE F. KOZDEMBA, and JANICE M. WESTON will be sentenced in December.
Last year, Chicago attorney PATRICK D. THOMPSON was convicted of making false statements to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. regarding the amount of money he received from Washington Federal via a purported loan and other unsecured payments.  Thompson was also convicted of filing tax returns in which he falsely deducted interest that he had not actually paid to Washington Federal.

Man Pleads Guilty to Illegally Distributing Over $16M of Adulterated HIV Medication,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/man-pleads-guilty-illegally-distributing-over-16m-adulterated,"September 25, 2023",2023,"A Florida man pleaded guilty today to distributing at least $16.7 million of adulterated HIV drugs that were ultimately dispensed to unsuspecting patients throughout the country.
According to court documents, Armando Herrera, 43, of Miami, and his co-conspirators established companies in Florida, Texas, Washington, and California that they used to sell and distribute adulterated prescription drugs, primarily HIV medications, to wholesale pharmaceutical suppliers. Herrera and his co-conspirators created false documentation to make it appear as though the drugs were acquired legitimately when, in fact, they were not. The pharmaceutical suppliers then sold the drugs to pharmacies, which dispensed the adulterated prescription drugs to unwitting patients.
Herrera pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to introduce adulterated and misbranded drugs into interstate commerce. He is scheduled to be sentenced on Dec. 21 and faces a maximum penalty of five years in person. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.

Financial Crimes Conference Aims to Give Law Enforcement Tools to Better Fight Internet Crime,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/financial-crimes-conference-aims-give-law-enforcement-tools,"September 19, 2023",2023,"MIAMI – Last week, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida recently convened a financial crimes training entitled “Taking the Byte out of Crime—Tools and Techniques for Fighting Internet Crimes Targeting Businesses and Individuals.”
More than 90 law enforcement officers and federal agents from Key West to Palm Beach met at Broward College Health Sciences Simulation Center in Davie, Fla., to enhance their knowledge base, discuss evolving internet crime schemes, hear about criminal case examples, and share investigative resources to combat crime. U.S. Attorney Markenzy Lapointe for the Southern District of Florida expressed his gratitude to those in attendance and acknowledged the importance of federal, state, and local law enforcement partnerships to reduce internet crimes.
The financial crimes conference offered the attendees an invaluable training opportunity on areas to include business email compromise scams, virtual currency tracing, illegal narcotics in the mail stream, mail theft, cryptocurrency scams, and the federal fraud statutes applicable to these offenses. Representatives from the following federal agencies presented during the conference: the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida; FBI Miami; Internal Revenue Service, Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI), Miami; U.S. Postal Service, Office of Inspector General (USPS-OIG), Miami; and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of Inspector General, Miami.
Some of the important public safety takeaways are:
No one can prevent all crime but protecting your personal identification information, and verifying the identity of those you are dealing with online is a great place to start. The sharing of information across agencies gives law enforcement more avenues to solve crimes.
“Criminality is evolving and it’s up to law enforcement to update its investigative techniques,” said Law Enforcement Coordination/Community Outreach Section Chief J.D. Smith, U.S. Attorney’s Office. “We put on these trainings because we see the value in them. The trainings bring law enforcement officers/agents and prosecutors together to learn from one another. The U.S. Attorney’s Office has been asked to host more of these conferences … and we will.”

Two Brothers Plead Guilty to $7.6M COVID-19 Relief Fraud,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/two-brothers-plead-guilty-76m-covid-19-relief-fraud,"September 8, 2023",2023,"Two brothers pleaded guilty yesterday to their participation in a scheme to file fraudulent loan applications seeking approximately $7.6 million in forgivable Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans that the Small Business Administration (SBA) guaranteed under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.
According to court documents, between April and September 2020, Larry Jordan, 45, of Lancaster, New York, and Sutukh El, aka Curtis Jordan, aka Hugo Hurt, aka Hugo Hermes Hurtington, 41, of Buffalo, New York, conspired to submit eight fraudulent PPP loan applications on behalf of companies they owned or controlled. The defendants submitted three of the applications to Evolve Bank & Trust and five to Lendio, a financial technology company based in Utah. The applications contained false statements about the 2019 payroll expenses of each company, which the SBA used to calculate the amount of PPP funds to which the applicant-companies would be entitled. To corroborate the applications, Jordan and El submitted IRS forms, which they had never filed with the IRS, as well as fraudulent payroll registers that purported to identify the names, personal information, and salary of the employees identified on the PPP applications. The money was then deposited into an account controlled by El, which the brothers used for their own investments, personal expenses, and home improvements.
Jordan and El pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit bank fraud and wire fraud, which carries a maximum penalty of 30 years in prison and a $1 million fine. Jordan also pleaded guilty to bank fraud, which carries a maximum penalty of 30 years in prison, and engaging in monetary transactions in criminally derived property, which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison. The brothers are scheduled to be sentenced on Jan. 17, 2024. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.

Former Bank President Ashton Ryan Sentenced to 14 Years in Prison for Fraud that Ended First NBC Bank,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/former-bank-president-ashton-ryan-sentenced-14-years-prison,"September 6, 2023",2023,"NEW ORLEANS – On September 6, 2023, United States District Judge Eldon E. Fallon sentenced ASHTON J. RYAN, JR. , age 75, of Kenner, Louisiana, to a term of imprisonment of 170 months following RYAN’s convictions for bank fraud and making false statements in bank records, announced U.S. Attorney Duane A. Evans.
In February 2023, following a five-week trial, a jury convicted Ryan on all 43 counts against him. The charges related to RYAN’s tenure as President, CEO, and Chairman of the Board at First NBC Bank (“Bank”), a now-defunct federally insured financial institution with its main branch in New Orleans, Louisiana. According to court documents and evidence presented at trial, RYAN and others conspired to defraud the Bank through a variety of schemes, including by disguising the true financial status of certain borrowers and their troubled loans, and concealing the true financial condition of the Bank from the Bank’s Board, external auditors, and federal examiners. As RYAN ’s fraud grew, it included several other bank employees and businesspeople from around the Gulf South. Several of the borrowers who conspired with RYAN, used First NBC money to pay RYAN individually or fund RYAN ’s own businesses. Using Bank money this way helped RYAN conceal  his  use of such money for his own benefit.
When the Bank’s Board, external auditors, and FDIC examiners asked about loans to these borrowers, RYAN and his fellow fraudsters lied about the borrowers and their loans, hiding the truth about the deadbeat borrowers’ inability to pay their debts without receiving new loans. As a result, the balance on the borrowers’ fraudulent loans continued to grow, resulting, ultimately, in the failure of the Bank  in April 2017. This failure caused approximately $1 billion in loss to the FDIC and the loss of approximately 500 jobs.
Judge Fallon sentenced RYAN to a term of imprisonment of 170 months as to each of the 43 counts of conviction to run concurrently, to be followed by a three-year term of supervised release. RYAN was ordered to pay restitution totaling over $214 million to the FDIC. Judge Fallon also ordered RYAN to pay a mandatory special assessment fee of $100 per count.
“Ashton Ryan’s years-long deceit caused at the time, one the biggest bank failure in America in over a decade,” said United States Attorney Duane A. Evans, “and with this sentence, he rightfully takes his place as one of the most notorious white-collar criminals in our district’s history. Ryan’s intelligence and charisma were outmatched by his hubris and vanity. Ryan and his accomplices spent years hiding their tracks, by using sophisticated means, all to maintain their house of cards.  But this office, along with our federal law enforcement partners, doggedly combed through the wreckage of what was First NBC to uncover the inner - workings of this complex fraud and its prime architect, RYAN . I am proud of this entire team’s work in identifying RYAN as the central figure in this years-long scheme and bringing him to justice.”
“Today’s sentencing sends a clear message that individuals who engage in fraudulent schemes that impact the security of financial institutions will be held accountable. This should be a deterrent to others who would attempt to manipulate the nation's banking system,” said Douglas A. Williams, Jr., FBI New Orleans Special Agent in Charge.  “We thank our partners at the United States Attorney’s Office Eastern District, the FDIC Office of Inspector General and the Federal Reserve Board, Office of Inspector General.”
“Today’s sentencing represents the hard work of many prosecutors, agents, analysts, and other staff in investigating and prosecuting those who defraud financial institutions, specifically individuals entrusted to oversee the operations of FNBC. The FDIC-OIG thanks the United States Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Louisiana as well as the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Office of Inspector General for the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System for their dedication and effort in helping to bring Mr. Ryan to justice, ”said Anand Ramlall, Special Agent in Charge, Dallas Region, Office of Inspector General for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
“Today’s sentencing of Ashton Ryan is a warning to bank executives that if you commit fraud and deceive bank regulators you will pay a price for your actions,” said Brian Tucker, Special Agent in Charge, Eastern Region, Office of Inspector General for the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. “We commend the hard work and dedication of all those involved in this case that ultimately led to today’s result. We will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to hold accountable those who undermine the safety and soundness of our banking institutions.”
The Assistant United States Attorneys who handled the trial were Senior Litigation Counsel Matthew R. Payne, Nicholas D. Moses of the Financial Crimes Unit, and J. Ryan McLaren of the Appellate Unit.

Bitcoin-for-Cash Exchange Business Owner Agrees to Plead Guilty to Failing to Maintain an Effective Anti-Money Laundering Program,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/bitcoin-cash-exchange-business-owner-agrees-plead-guilty-failing,"September 5, 2023",2023,"LOS ANGELES – A Santa Monica man has agreed to plead guilty to breaking federal law by allowing his cryptocurrency-cash exchange company to help scammers and drug traffickers launder millions of dollars in criminal proceeds through his business, the Justice Department announced today.
Charles James Randol, 33, agreed to plead guilty to a single-count information charging him with failure to maintain an effective anti-money laundering (AML) program, a crime that carries a statutory maximum sentence of five years in federal prison.
Both the information and plea agreement were filed today in United States District Court in downtown Los Angeles. Randol is expected to formally plead guilty to the charge in the coming weeks.
According to his plea agreement, from October 2017 to July 2021, Randol owned and operated a virtual-currency money services business that eventually was known as Digital Coin Strategies LLC. This company offered cryptocurrency-cash exchange services for a commission.
Randol offered his cryptocurrency exchange services in various ways, including meeting anonymous customers in-person to complete transactions, controlling and operating a network of automated kiosks in Los Angeles, Orange, and Riverside counties that converted cash to Bitcoin and vice versa, and conducting Bitcoin-for-cash transactions for unknown individuals who mailed large amounts of U.S. currency to him, including to post office boxes that he controlled.
Randol advertised his business on various websites, and he maintained a company website that falsely claimed his business was “a fully compliant…money services business” that was registered with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, a bureau of the United States Treasury Department. In fact, as Randol admitted in his plea agreement, he repeatedly violated federal law and his company’s own AML policies by facilitating suspicious currency exchange transactions and taking steps to conceal them from law enforcement, including by failing to file required currency transaction reports and suspicious activity reports.
For example, Randol frequently conducted in-person cash transactions that exceeded $10,000 with anonymous or pseudo-anonymous individuals, including people who Randol knew only as “Puppet Shariff,” “White Jetta,” “Aaavvv,” “Aaaa,” “Yogurt Monster,” and “Hood.” In his plea agreement, Randol admitted to engaging in three specific transactions from October 2020 to January 2021 in which he exchanged a total of $273,940 in cash for Bitcoin without requesting a name, proof of identity, Social Security number, or any other information about the buyer or the source of the funds being exchanged. Such transactions violated the Bank Secrecy Act and his company’s AML policy, which required, among other things, that he verify the identity of customers engaging in transactions over $9,999 by obtaining the customer’s full name, address, Social Security number, a verified phone number, and a photocopy of the customer’s official government identification.
While operating his crypto-exchange business, Randol also conducted hundreds of Bitcoin-for-cash transactions after receiving large cash shipments in the mail from anonymous individuals. In a typical transaction, an anonymous individual would text Randol using an encrypted platform to notify him that a parcel containing cash had been sent to a location that Randol controlled in or around Los Angeles. Once Randol received the parcel, he would count the money and send an equivalent amount of Bitcoin – minus a commission – to a digital wallet controlled by his customers. As with in-person transactions, Randol did not conduct any due diligence on the people mailing him large sums of cash, the source of funds being exchanged, or the purpose of the transaction.
When Randol received the packages, the cash was often packaged in a suspicious manner, including cash hidden inside children’s books, concealed inside fake birthday or holiday presents, buried within puzzle pieces, or wrapped within multiple magazines.
On June 5, 2019, FBI agents interviewed Randol about fraud proceeds that had been mailed to post office boxes he controlled. Two days later, Randol texted a customer stating that he would be taking a “hiatus” from converting cash parcels into cryptocurrency because he “ran into an issue with [law enforcement].” But less than a week later, Randol resumed his cash parcels activity after that same anonymous customer asked Randol if he could exchange $10,000 in cash for Bitcoin.
Randol admitted that his failure to comply with Bank Secrecy Act requirements, including maintaining an effective AML program resulted in criminals using Randol’s business to launder millions of dollars of criminal proceeds. For example, between June 2018 and early 2020, Randol exchanged Bitcoin for cash that was mailed to him by a New Jersey resident who had been tricked into believing his grandson was facing criminal prosecution after purportedly killing an elderly woman in a traffic accident and that the money the victim was sending would be used to help the victim’s grandson with his legal problems. Based on these lies, the victim drained his savings and retirement accounts. While Randol did not participate in the fraud, his business converted the victim’s cash to cryptocurrency and sent it to various digital wallets without conducting any customer due diligence or investigating the source of the money he was receiving.
Because to Randol’s deficient AML practices, criminals were also able to structure and launder funds through his Bitcoin kiosks. Specifically, Randol operated numerous Bitcoin kiosks, which were in malls, gas stations, and convenience stores in cities such as Los Angeles, Glendale, Santa Clarita, Huntington Beach, Santa Ana, and Riverside.
But the setting on Randol’s kiosks allowed customers to structure funds to avoid currency reporting requirements by creating numerous accounts and by engaging in successive transactions involving up to $3,000. He also set up one or more “test” accounts that contained no customer information, which he allowed customers to use to complete kiosk transactions.
In September 2020, Randol hired a compliance officer for Digital Coin Strategies. Randol ignored this individual’s advice to cease any use of “test” accounts for customer transactions on Bitcoin kiosks. Randol also continued to conduct in-person transactions, despite his compliance officer’s warning that doing so increased the risk that the cash or Bitcoin Randol was receiving was derived from an unlawful source.
The FBI and Homeland Security Investigations investigated this matter, with assistance from Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General, and the United States Postal Inspection Service.
Assistant United States Attorneys Ian V. Yanniello of the General Crimes Section and James E. Dochterman of the Asset Forfeiture and Recovery Section are prosecuting this case.

Justice Department Announces Results of Nationwide COVID-19 Fraud Enforcement Action,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/justice-department-announces-results-nationwide-covid-19-fraud,"August 23, 2023",2023,"Department Also Announces the Launch of Two New COVID-19 Fraud Strike Forces
The Justice Department announced today the results of a coordinated, nationwide enforcement action to combat COVID-19 fraud, which included 718 enforcement actions – including federal criminal charges against 371 defendants – for offenses related to over $836 million in alleged COVID-19 fraud.
“The Justice Department has now seized over $1.4 billion in COVID-19 relief funds that criminals had stolen and charged over 3,000 defendants with crimes in federal districts across the country,” said Attorney General Merrick B. Garland. “This latest action, involving over 300 defendants and over $830 million in alleged COVID-19 fraud, should send a clear message: the COVID-19 public health emergency may have ended, but the Justice Department’s work to identify and prosecute those who stole pandemic relief funds is far from over.”
The announcement was made by Deputy Attorney General Lisa O. Monaco at a roundtable meeting of senior Justice Department officials, law enforcement partners, and Office of Inspector General (OIG) executives. Deputy Attorney General Monaco also announced the launch of two additional COVID-19 Fraud Enforcement Strike Forces: one at the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Colorado, and one at the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of New Jersey. These two strike forces add to the three strike forces launched in September 2022 in the Eastern and Central Districts of California, the Southern District of Florida, and the District of Maryland.
“The law enforcement actions announced today reflect the Justice Department’s focus – working with our law enforcement partners nationwide – on bringing to justice those who stole from American businesses and families at a time of national emergency,” said Deputy Attorney General Monaco. “The two new Strike Forces launched today will increase our reach as we continue to pursue fraudsters and recover taxpayer funds, no matter how long it takes.”
At the meeting, Michael C. Galdo, Acting Director of COVID-19 Fraud Enforcement, detailed the results of the three-month coordinated law enforcement action that took place from May through July 2023, which included criminal, civil, and forfeiture actions. More than 50 U.S. Attorneys’ Offices, including the COVID-19 Fraud Enforcement Strike Forces, the Justice Department’s Criminal and Civil Divisions, and more than a dozen law enforcement and OIG partners worked together to conduct the sweep.
“I applaud the hard work of our prosecutors around the country,” said Acting Director Galdo. “However, this announcement is not a victory lap. Our mission is not complete. We know from our investigative partners that identifying those who committed pandemic relief fraud and recovering stolen funds is difficult work. But the Justice Department, including our strike forces, U.S. Attorneys’ Offices, and the Criminal and Civil Divisions, is committed to using our criminal, civil, and forfeiture tools to hold these fraudsters accountable.”
As part of the effort, 718 law enforcement actions occurred, including criminal charges, civil charges, forfeitures, guilty pleas, and sentencings, with a combined total actual loss of more than $836 million. Criminal charges were filed against 371 defendants, and 119 defendants pleaded guilty or were convicted at trial during the sweep. Over $57 million in court-ordered restitution was imposed. 117 civil matters occurred during the sweep, with over $10.4 million in judgments. Prosecutors worked with law enforcement to secure forfeiture of over $231.4 million.
As part of the announcement, Acting Director Galdo said that 63 of the defendants had alleged connections to violent crime, including violent gang members also accused of using pandemic funds to pay for a murder for hire. Twenty-five defendants have alleged connections to transnational crime networks.
Many of the cases in the enforcement action involve charges related to pandemic unemployment insurance benefit fraud and fraud against the two largest pandemic Small Business Administration programs: the Paycheck Protection Program and Economic Injury Disaster Loans. Additional matters involved pandemic healthcare billing fraud, fraud against the Emergency Rental Assistance program, and fraud committed against the IRS Employee Retention Credit program (ERC), a refundable tax credit for businesses and tax-exempt organizations that had employees and were affected during the COVID-19 pandemic. IRS Criminal Investigations (IRS-CI) worked with the California Strike Force and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of New Jersey to bring multimillion dollar ERC fraud cases during the enforcement action.
In May 2021, the Attorney General established the COVID-19 Fraud Enforcement Task Force (CFETF) to marshal the resources of the Department of Justice in partnership with agencies across government to enhance efforts to combat and prevent pandemic-related fraud. The task force bolsters efforts to investigate and prosecute the most culpable domestic and international criminal actors and assists agencies tasked with administering relief programs to prevent fraud by, among other methods, augmenting and incorporating existing coordination mechanisms, identifying resources and techniques to uncover fraudulent actors and their schemes, and sharing and harnessing information and insights gained from prior enforcement efforts.
The COVID-19 Fraud Enforcement Action cases were prosecuted by the following Justice Department entities: Criminal Division’s Fraud Section; Civil Division’s Fraud Section, Consumer Protection Branch; and by the following U.S. Attorneys’ Offices: Northern District of Alabama, Southern District of Alabama, Arizona, Eastern District of California, Central District of California, Northern District of California, Southern District of California, Colorado, Washington, D.C., Delaware, Middle District of Florida, Northern District of Florida, Southern District of Florida, Middle District of Georgia, Northern District of Georgia, Southern District of Georgia, Southern District of Indiana, Idaho, Northern District of Illinois, Northern District of Iowa, Eastern District of Kentucky, Western District of Kentucky, Western District of Louisiana, Massachusetts, Maryland, Eastern District of Michigan, Western District of Michigan, Eastern District of Missouri, Western District of Missouri, Northern District of Mississippi, Maine, Montana, Eastern District of North Carolina, Western District of North Carolina, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Nevada, Northern District of New York, Northern District of Oklahoma, Northern District of Ohio, Southern District of Ohio, Oregon, Eastern District of Pennsylvania, Middle District of Pennsylvania, Western District of Pennsylvania, Puerto Rico, Rhode Island, Eastern District of Texas, Northern District of Texas, Southern District of Texas, Western District of Texas, Eastern District of Virginia, Western District of Virginia, Eastern District of Washington, Western District of Washington, Eastern District of Wisconsin, and Northern District of West Virginia.

Three Board Members of Failed Washington Federal Bank in Chicago Guilty of Falsifying Records and Obstructing Regulators,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/three-board-members-failed-washington-federal-bank-chicago,"August 8, 2023",2023,"CHICAGO — Three former board members of the failed Washington Federal Bank for Savings in Chicago have pleaded guilty in federal court to conspiring to falsify bank records to deceive the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.
WILLIAM M. MAHON, 56, of Chicago, and GEORGE F. KOZDEMBA, 73, of Fort Myers, Fla., pleaded guilty to the conspiracy charge during a hearing Monday before U.S. District Judge Virginia M. Kendall.  Mahon’s guilty plea also included a tax offense for willfully filing false income tax returns.  Last week, JANICE M. WESTON, 65, of Orland Park, Ill., pleaded guilty to the conspiracy charge.  Judge Kendall set sentencings for Oct. 20, 2023, for Weston; Dec. 11, 2023, for Mahon; and Dec. 12, 2023, for Kozdemba.  The conspiracy charge is punishable by up to five years in federal prison.  The additional tax offense against Mahon is punishable by up to three years.
Mahon, Kozdemba, and Weston were members of Washington Federal’s Board of Directors.  Weston also served as the bank’s Senior Vice President and Compliance Officer.  Washington Federal was closed in 2017 after the OCC determined that the bank was insolvent and had at least $66 million in nonperforming loans.  A federal investigation led to criminal charges against 16 defendants, including charges against the bank’s Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer, and other high-ranking employees, for conspiring to embezzle at least $31 million in bank funds.  Eight defendants have pleaded guilty or entered into agreements to cooperate with the government.
Much of the money was transferred to Chicago attorney ROBERT M. KOWALSKI and other individuals outside the bank without all of the required documentation and often without any documentation whatsoever.  A jury earlier this year convicted Robert Kowalski on embezzlement and fraud charges .  He is awaiting sentencing.
Robert Kowalski’s sister, JAN R. KOWALSKI, also an attorney, pleaded guilty and was sentenced in June to more than three years in federal prison for fraudulently enabling her brother to conceal more than $357,000 from creditors and the trustee in his bankruptcy case.
Last year, Chicago attorney PATRICK D. THOMPSON was convicted by a jury of making false statements to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. regarding the amount of money he received from Washington Federal via a purported loan and other unsecured payments.  He was also convicted of filing tax returns in which he falsely deducted interest that he had not actually paid to Washington Federal.  Thompson was sentenced to four months in federal prison.
When the OCC was evaluating Washington Federal’s loan portfolio prior to its failure, Mahon, Weston, Kozdemba, and others made and caused to be made false entries in bank records and provided them to the OCC with the intent to deceive the agency and obstruct its examination.  They also falsified records to make it appear that Washington Federal was operating in compliance with banking rules and internal policies and controls.
The guilty pleas were announced by Morris Pasqual, Acting United States Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois; Vincent R. Zehme, Special Agent-in-Charge of the Chicago Region of the FDIC’s Office of Inspector General; Machelle L. Jindra, Special Agent-in-Charge of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's Office of Inspector General in Chicago; Justin Campbell, Special Agent-in-Charge of IRS Criminal Investigation in Chicago; Catherine Huber, Special Agent-in-Charge of the Central Region of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, Office of Inspector General; Robert W. “Wes” Wheeler, Jr., Special Agent-in-Charge of the Chicago Field Office of the FBI; Andrea Peacock, Special Agent-in-Charge of the Department of the Treasury, Office of Inspector General; Deborah Witzburg, City of Chicago Inspector General; and Kathryn B. Richards, Chicago Housing Authority Inspector General.  Valuable assistance was provided by the U.S. Trustee Program.  The government is represented by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Michelle Petersen, Kristin Pinkston, and Brian Netols, and Special Assistant U.S. Attorney Jeffrey Snell.

Orange County Woman and Man Charged with Running $2.2 Million Scheme that Tricked Banks into Cashing Out Victims’ Mortgages,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/orange-county-woman-and-man-charged-running-22-million-scheme,"August 1, 2023",2023,"SANTA ANA, California – Two Orange County residents have been charged by a federal grand jury with fraudulently obtaining more than $2 million by stealing the identities of homeowners – primarily elderly Vietnamese Americans – and duping banks into “cashing out” mortgages on those properties, the Justice Department announced today.
Thao Thi Kim Nguyen, 47, of Garden Grove, and Nghiep Chinh Nguyen, 55, of Westminster, were arraigned Monday afternoon in United States District Court in Santa Ana.
Both defendants, who have been granted bond, are charged with one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud and wire fraud. Thao Nguyen additionally is charged with seven counts of bank fraud and three counts of aggravated identity theft. Nghiep Nguyen is charged further with two counts of bank fraud and one count of aggravated identity theft.
At their arraignments, the defendants pleaded not guilty to the charges against them. A September 26 trial date was scheduled in this matter.
The schemers allegedly obtained a type of mortgage that allows homeowners to convert home equity into cash by borrowing against the value of the property.
According to an indictment returned on July 26, during a roughly four-month period in 2018, Thao Nguyen opened accounts in her name at two banks. The alleged purpose of these bank accounts was to collect the scheme’s ill-gotten gains.
Thao Nguyen then would visit the bank, accompanied Nghiep Nguyen and other co-schemers. Nghiep Nguyen and other co-schemers posed as the victim homeowners – whose identities they allegedly had stolen – and forged the victims’ signatures to fraudulently obtain cash-out mortgages on the victim-owned properties, which otherwise were unencumbered.
To pursue the fraud, Nghiep Nguyen allegedly used counterfeit California driver’s licenses and Social Security cards containing the victims’ names, and forged the victims’ signatures on documents, including bank and mortgage forms as well as grant deeds for the victims’ real estate properties. The victims’ names also were added to the Thao Nguyen-controlled bank accounts.
Thao Nguyen allegedly used her accounts to receive wire transfers totaling more than $2 million in fraudulently obtained cash-out mortgage proceeds. She allegedly would transfer the fraudulently obtained mortgage proceeds to other bank accounts she controlled and would make cash withdrawals totaling approximately $1 million. The remaining funds were distributed to the co-schemers.
In total, the defendants fraudulently obtained approximately $2,182,753 through the scheme, the indictment alleges.
For example, in July 2018, Thao Nguyen opened a bank account in her name. Later that month, Nghiep Nguyen and another co-schemer, accompanied by Thao Nguyen allegedly posed as two homeowners at the bank branch in Orange.
Two days later, Nghiep Nguyen allegedly forged the two victim homeowners’ signatures on a grant deed for properties in Garden Grove and Long Beach. Nghiep Nguyen and another co-schemer allegedly then used fake IDs in the victims’ names to add those names to Thao Nguyen’s bank account. While doing so Thao Nguyen told bank personnel that the victims were her parents, according to the indictment.
In August 2018, Thao Nguyen allegedly received a wire transfer of approximately $623,196 in fraudulent mortgage proceeds. She then transferred most of the ill-gotten funds to accounts she and another co-schemer controlled, according to the indictment.
An indictment is merely an allegation. All defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.
If convicted of all charges, the defendants would face a statutory maximum sentence of 30 years in federal prison for each conspiracy and fraud charge, and a mandatory sentence of two years in federal prison for each aggravated identity theft charge.
The FBI, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General, and IRS Criminal Investigation are investigating this matter. The Long Beach Police Department, the California Attorney General’s Office, and investigators with the Alameda County District Attorney’s Office provided assistance.
Assistant United States Attorney Charles E. Pell of the Santa Ana Branch Office and Special Assistant United States Attorney Gregory B. Wagner are prosecuting this case.

Former Chairman of 1 Global Indicted for Running $250 Million Securities Fraud Scheme,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/former-chairman-1-global-indicted-running-250-million-securities,"July 26, 2023",2023,"MIAMI – Carl R. Ruderman, 81, former chairman of 1 Global Capital LLC (“1 Global”) was indicted yesterday with orchestrating a sprawling fraud scheme that affected more than 3,400 investors in 42 different states. Four of Ruderman’s co-conspirators have already pleaded guilty for their role in this fraud.
Alan G. Heide, 65, of Lake Worth, Florida, the former 1 Global chief financial officer, pleaded to a single count information, charging him with one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud (case no. 19-cr-60231), and was sentenced to 60 months in prison by U.S. District Judge Roy K. Altman. Judge Altman also ordered Heide to pay over $57 million in restitution to the victims of the scheme.
Andrew Dale Ledbetter, 81, of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud and securities fraud (case no. 20-cr-60103), and was sentenced by Judge Altman to 60 months in prison. Judge Altman also ordered Ledbetter to pay over $148 million to the victims of the scheme.
Steven Allen Schwartz, 78, of Delray Beach, Florida, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud and securities fraud (case no. 20-cr-60003), and was sentenced to 24 months in prison by Judge Altman. Judge Altman also ordered Schwartz to pay over $36 million in restitution to the victims of the scheme.
Jan Douglas Atlas, 78, of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud and securities fraud (case no. 19-cr-60258), and was sentenced to eight months in prison by Judge Altman. Judge Altman also ordered Atlas to pay over $29 million in restitution to the victims of the scheme.
According to the indictment, 1 Global was a commercial lending business based in Hallandale Beach, Florida, that made the equivalent of “pay day” loans to small businesses at high interest rates, termed merchant cash advance loans (“MCAs”). Ruderman was the chairman of 1 Global and Heide was the chief financial officer. Schwartz was a director and consultant at 1 Global, and also held out as a chief operating officer in the company’s marketing materials. Ledbetter was an attorney licensed in the State of Florida who had an of counsel position at Law Firm #1 and acted in a fundraising capacity at 1 Global beginning around 2015. Atlas was a partner at Law Firm #1 and acted as outside counsel for 1 Global.
The indictment alleges that to attract investments, Ruderman and others, made false and misleading representations to investors and potential investors as to the profitability of 1 Global’s business in marketing materials and periodic account statements. Allegedly, investors were falsely told that 1 Global had audited financials by a public accounting firm, that the investor’s money would be spent on the MCAs, and that they could expect double-digit returns on their investments, among other things.
It is alleged that Ruderman spent 1 Global’s investor’s money on credit card payments, vacation travel, insurance payments for his art collection and valuable jewelry, drivers, nannies, housekeepers, mortgage payments for his house, tuition, and payments for a luxury car driven by his wife. Ruderman also diverted 1 Global investor money to businesses benefitting him and his family, without the investors’ knowledge.
According to the allegations, substantial questions arose during the operation of the business as to whether 1 Global was offering or selling a security and whether the investment offering was required to be registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Allegedly, these questions were raised by investors, investment advisors, and regulators. As alleged in the charging documents, Ruderman knew that if 1 Global’s investment offering were determined to be a security, it would undermine the ability of 1 Global to raise funds from retail investors and to continue to operate without substantial additional expenses and reporting requirements. Such a classification would undermine the profits and fees that Ledbetter and other principals at 1 Global would be able to obtain from 1 Global’s operations.
As alleged in the indictment, at the request of Ruderman, Atlas authored two opinion letters in 2016 containing false information that Atlas allegedly knew would be used by 1 Global to operate the business unlawfully. The opinion letters falsely described the duration of the investment, among other things, omitting the automatic renewal aspect and that the investment was being targeted toward retail, non-sophisticated investors (such as IRA account holders). Allegedly, Ruderman and others at 1 Global used and relied on Atlas’s opinion letters to continue to raise money illegally, in numerous pitches and communications to investment advisors and investors.
1 Global filed for bankruptcy on July 27, 2018. As of that time, according to documents from related cases, 1 Global had more than 3,400 investors and had raised more than $250 million during the scheme. The bankruptcy case, In re: 1 Global Capital LLC, et al., No. 18-19121-RBR (S.D. Fla.), remains pending.

Five Individuals Charged in Multi-State COVID-19 Relief Program Fraud Scheme,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/five-individuals-charged-multi-state-covid-19-relief-program,"July 19, 2023",2023,"Two Others Plead Guilty

CAMDEN, N.J. – Five individuals were charged for their roles in fraudulently obtaining federal Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans and Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL) and for laundering the loan proceeds, U.S. Attorney Philip R. Sellinger announced today. Two other individuals pleaded guilty to fraudulently obtaining PPP and EIDL loans.
Eric Rivera, 43, of Norcross, Georgia, is charged by complaint with one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud, one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. He made is initial appearance in federal court in the Northern District of Georgia and was released on $10,000 unsecured bond. Lisa Smith, 60, of Cornelius, North Carolina, and Sieff Robert Sargeant, 43, of Island Park, New York, are charged by complaint with one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. Smith had her initial appearance in the Western District of North Carolina and was released on $25,000 unsecured bond. Sargeant is scheduled to make his initial appearance today before Magistrate Judge Ann Marie Donio in Camden federal court.
Adrienne Ponzo, 48, of Bear, Delaware, is charged by complaint with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, and remains at-large. James Wessels, 53, of Middletown, Delaware, is charged by complaint with one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. He made his initial appearance before Judge Donio and was released on $100,000 unsecured bond.
According to the criminal complaints:
The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act is a federal law enacted in March 2020 and was designed to provide emergency financial assistance to the millions of Americans who are suffering the economic effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.  One source of relief provided by the CARES Act was the authorization of hundreds of billions of dollars in forgivable loans to small businesses for job retention and certain other expenses, through a program referred to as the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP).  The CARES Act also authorized the Small Business Administration to provide Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDLs) of up to $2 million to eligible small businesses that were experiencing substantial financial disruption due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
To obtain a PPP or EIDL loan, a qualifying small business was required to apply and provide information on its operations, including the number of employees and expenses.  In addition, businesses generally had to provide supporting documentation.
According to documents filed in these cases and statements made in court:
In one conspiracy, Rivera conspired with Smith, Sargeant, and others to defraud the PPP loan program. Rivera recruited individuals – including Sargeant – who owned businesses with minimal operations, employees, revenues, and profits, and introduced them to Smith. Smith prepared fraudulent PPP applications for these businesses and created false tax returns that were created solely for purposes of applying for the PPP and EIDL loans and were never submitted to the IRS. The applicants, including Sargeant, electronically signed the applications, which were then submitted to lenders. Rivera received payments of 15 to 50 percent of the loan proceeds for his role in orchestrating this scheme.
In the second conspiracy, Rivera conspired with Ponzo and others to defraud the EIDL loan program. He recruited individuals who owned businesses with minimal operations, employees, revenues, and profits and introduced them to Ponzo, who prepared fraudulent EIDL applications for these businesses and caused them to be electronically submitted to the Small Business Administration. Rivera received payments of 15 to 50 percent of the loan proceeds for his role in orchestrating this scheme.
In the third conspiracy, Rivera conspired with Smith, Wessels, and Sargeant to structure the PPP loan proceeds and paperwork to conceal that the proceeds actually were being spent on non-payroll expenses. Rivera and Smith introduced Sargeant to Wessels, who created fake payroll checks and provided them to Sargeant.  Sargeant distributed the fake payroll checks to friends and family members, who cashed the checks and returned the majority of the cash to Sargeant. Smith then used the fake payroll documentation to submit a loan forgiveness application for Sargeant’s business that falsely stated that Sargeant spent 66 percent of the loan amount on payroll expenses.
The counts of conspiracy to commit bank fraud are each punishable by a maximum of 30 years in prison and a $1 million fine. The counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud are each punishable by a maximum of 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine, or twice the gross gain or loss from the offense, whichever is greatest. The count of conspiracy to commit money laundering is punishable by a maximum of 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine, or twice the gross gain or loss from the offense, whichever is greatest.
Earlier this month, Yasha Barjona, 67, and William Ingram, 43, each pleaded guilty before U.S. District Judge Karen Williams to one count of bank fraud conspiracy.
According to documents filed in these cases and statements made in court:
Ingram and Barjona owned businesses with minimal operations, employees, revenues, and profits. Rivera introduced Ingram and Barjona to Ponzo and Smith. Ponzo prepared fraudulent EIDL applications for Ingram’s and Barjona’s businesses and Smith prepared fraudulent PPP applications for Ingram’s and Barjona’s businesses. Ingram and Barjona electronically signed and submitted these applications, which contained materially false and fraudulent information about the businesses and included false tax returns that were created solely for purposes of applying for the PPP and EIDL loans and were never submitted to the IRS.  Ponzo and Smith also prepared fraudulent EIDL and PPP applications for businesses controlled by associates of Barjona.
Barjona and his associates received approximately $724,300 in PPP and EIDL proceeds and paid kickbacks to Rivera of approximately 50 percent of the loan amounts. Ingram received approximately $551,600 in PPP and EIDL proceeds and paid kickbacks to Rivera of approximately 15 percent of the loan amounts. After Ingram received the PPP loans, Rivera and Smith introduced Ingram to Wessels, who prepared fake payroll documents to conceal that the proceeds were being spent on non-payroll expenses. Sentencing for Ingram’s sentencing is scheduled for Nov. 7, 2023, and for Barjona, Nov. 15, 2023.
U.S. Attorney Sellinger credited special agents of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation – Office of the Inspector General, under the direction of Patricia Tarasca, Special Agent-in-Charge, New York Regional Office; special agents of the FBI’s South Jersey Resident Agency, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Jacqueline Maguire in Philadelphia; special agents of the Social Security Administration, Office of the Inspector General, New York Field Division, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Sharon MacDermott; and special agents of the U.S. Department of Labor, Office of the Inspector General, Northeast Region, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Jonathan Mellone, with the investigation leading to the charges and guilty pleas.
The government is represented by Assistant U.S. Attorney Daniel A. Friedman and Attorney-in-Charge Jason M. Richardson of the U.S. Attorney’s Office’s Criminal Division in Camden.
The charges and allegations contained in the complaints are merely accusations, and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.

Attorney And Former Bank Director Convicted At Trial Of Bank Fraud,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/attorney-and-former-bank-director-convicted-trial-bank-fraud,"July 12, 2023",2023,"Damian Williams, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, announced that yesterday a federal jury found MENDEL ZILBERBERG guilty of five counts — conspiracy to commit bank fraud, bank fraud, conspiracy to make false statements to a bank, making false statements to a bank, and misapplication of bank funds — in connection with a scheme to obtain a fraudulent loan from Park Avenue Bank.  The defendant was found guilty following a one-week trial before U.S. District Judge George B. Daniels.  Sentencing is scheduled for November 29, 2023, before Judge Daniels.
U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said: “Mendel Zilberberg, while working as a practicing lawyer and serving as a director of Park Avenue Bank, ignored his duties and took advantage of the bank, viewing it as the object of his fraud scheme.  Far from helping the bank through a tenuous moment in its existence, Zilberberg was focused on squeezing money out of it for himself, on the basis of lies.  The bank collapsed just months after Zilberberg defrauded it.”
According to the allegations contained in the Indictment, the evidence offered at trial, and matters included in public filings:
In or about 2009, ZILBERBERG conspired with Aron Fried and others to obtain a fraudulent loan from Park Avenue Bank (the “Bank”).  Knowing that the conspirators would not be able to obtain the loan directly, the conspirators recruited a straw borrower (the “Straw Borrower”) to make the loan application.  The Straw Borrower applied for a $1.4 million loan from the Bank on the basis of numerous lies directed by ZILBERBERG and his coconspirators.
ZILBERBERG used his privileged position at the bank to ensure that the loan was processed promptly.  Based on the false representations made to the Bank and ZILBERBERG’s involvement in the loan approval process, the Bank issued a $1.4 million loan to the Straw Borrower, which was quickly disbursed to the defendants through multiple bank accounts and transfers.  In total, ZILBERBERG received more than approximately $500,000 of the loan proceeds.  The remainder of the loan was split between Fried and another conspirator.  The Straw Borrower received nothing from the loan.  The loan ultimately defaulted, resulting in a loss of over $1 million.
On November 15, 2022, Fried pled guilty to conspiracy to commit bank fraud.  On April 10, 2023, Judge Daniels sentenced Fried to one year and one day in prison.
*                *                *
ZILBERBERG, 65 of Monsey, New York, was convicted of conspiracy to commit bank fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison; bank fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison; conspiracy to make false statements to a bank, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison; making false statement to a bank, which carries a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison; and misapplying bank funds, which carries a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison.  The maximum sentence ZILBERBERG faces on all of these charges is 125 years in prison.
The maximum potential sentences in this case are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendant will be determined by the judge.
Mr. Williams praised the outstanding investigative work of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of the Inspector General.
This case is being handled by the Office’s Complex Frauds and Cybercrime Unit.  Assistant U.S. Attorneys Dina McLeod, Daniel G. Nessim, and Kimberly Ravener, with the assistance of Paralegal Specialist Joseph Carbone, are in charge of the prosecution.

"West L.A. Man Gets More Than 6 Years in Prison for Illicitly Obtaining Nearly $9 Million in COVID Loans, Some of Which He Used for Las Vegas Gambling",https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/west-la-man-gets-more-6-years-prison-illicitly-obtaining-nearly,"July 10, 2023",2023,"LOS ANGELES – A West Los Angeles man was sentenced today to 79 months in federal prison for fraudulently obtaining approximately $9 million in COVID-19 business loans, some of which he used on gambling excursions to Las Vegas and transferred to his stock trading accounts.
Andrew Marnell, 43, was sentenced by United States District Judge R. Gary Klausner, who scheduled a restitution hearing for August 28.
Marnell pleaded guilty in September 2021 to one count of bank fraud and one count of money laundering.
From March 2020 to July 2020, Marnell schemed to defraud lenders and the Small Business Administration (SBA) by submitting fraudulent loan applications under the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), which Congress designed to aid businesses feeling the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and another SBA loan program called the Economic Injury Disaster Loan Program (EIDL).
Marnell’s bogus loan applications contained numerous false and misleading statements about his shell companies’ business operations and payroll expenses. Marnell, often using aliases, submitted fake and altered documents to obtain the small business loans, including bogus federal tax filings and employee payroll records.
In total, Marnell submitted applications for PPP loans in amounts exceeding $10 million and lenders funded nearly $9 million in loans to his fake companies. In addition, Marnell requested EIDL loans from the SBA in the amount of $320,000, and of that amount, $170,000 was funded.
Once Marnell obtained the illicitly obtained loans, he used the money for gambling, including at a Las Vegas casino and in stock market trades, and for purchasing luxury goods. As part of his plea agreement with federal prosecutors, Marnell agreed to forfeit his ill-gotten gains, including Rolex watches, multiple laptop computers and tablets, a Range Rover automobile, a Ducati motorcycle, and hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash. The government also seized more than $1.5 million from various Marnell-controlled accounts, including those used to trade in the stock market.
“As soon as the federal government declared a national emergency and took action to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, [Marnell] started scheming to steal relief funds intended to save small businesses from going bankrupt and millions of individuals from losing their jobs,” prosecutors argued in a sentencing memorandum. “[Marnell] was one of the first people arrested in this district for pandemic-related fraud, and thus he was one of the first out of the proverbial gate to start defrauding programs designed to provide emergency assistance and relief to those impacted by the pandemic, including owners of small businesses.”
The Federal Housing Finance Agency Office of Inspector General; the FBI; the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General; IRS Criminal Investigation; the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration; and the Small Business Administration Office of Inspector General investigated this matter. The California Department of Justice Bureau of Gambling Control provided assistance in the investigation.
Assistant United States Attorney Kerry L. Quinn of the Major Frauds Section prosecuted this case.

"Former Bank VP Pleads Guilty to Embezzling $550,000",https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/former-bank-vp-pleads-guilty-embezzling-550000,"July 6, 2023",2023,"JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. – A former bank vice president pleaded guilty in federal court today to embezzling at least $550,000 from the People’s Bank of Moniteau County.
Angela Flippin, 51, of Jamestown, Mo., waived her right to a grand jury and pleaded guilty before U.S. Magistrate Judge Willie J. Epps, Jr. to a federal information that charges her with one count of embezzlement by a bank employee and one count of filing a false federal tax return.
Flippin was the vice president and chief operating officer at the People’s Bank of Moniteau County, which has locations in Jamestown and California, Mo. She was also the board secretary for many years and held that position when she was terminated.
By pleading guilty today, Flippin admitted that she embezzled at least $550,000 from 2010 to Jan. 30, 2017. The government believes she embezzled $645,638 and will present evidence for that amount at the sentencing hearing.
In January 2017, the Missouri Division of Finance discovered improper transactions involving Flippin. From 2010 through 2017, three areas of improper activity were identified; improper disbursements; improper expense reimbursements; and improper insurance premiums. Through their analysis, auditors determined Flippin received more than $550,000 in improper comp time disbursements and more than $8,000 in improper expense reimbursements.
Flippin personally held three separate bank accounts. Analysis of these bank accounts by federal investigators found Flippin made payroll deposits in the amount of $105,750. In addition to Flippin’s payroll deposits there were other deposits which totaled $892,782. Analysis of expenditures from Flippin’s bank accounts found $338,569 in PayPal online shopping transactions and other general debit card transactions.
Flippin also admitted that she failed to report the amounts that she embezzled from People’s Bank of Moniteau County on her 2014, 2015, and 2016 federal income tax returns. During those three years, she embezzled a total of $372,745, resulting in a total tax loss to the federal government of $96,434.
Under federal statutes, Flippin is subject to a sentence of up to 33 years in federal prison without parole. The maximum statutory sentence is prescribed by Congress and is provided here for informational purposes, as the sentencing of the defendant will be determined by the court based on the advisory sentencing guidelines and other statutory factors. A sentencing hearing will be scheduled after the completion of a presentence investigation by the United States Probation Office.

"Former Atlanta business-owner sentenced to prison for obtaining millions of dollars in COVID-19 relief fraud, tax identity theft and credit card fraud",https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/former-atlanta-business-owner-sentenced-prison-obtaining,"June 30, 2023",2023,"ATLANTA – Jose Fernandez has been sentenced for seeking over $5 million by submitting fraudulent Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) applications, filing false tax returns using stolen identities, using credit cards he obtained with stolen identities, and check fraud. He ultimately obtained more than $2 million in fraudulent funds, which he then used for his personal benefit.
“Fernandez committed a litany of frauds, including an attempt to steal millions of dollars from a COVID relief program, financial institutions, and the IRS by stealing the identities of innocent victims to file false tax returns,” said U.S. Attorney Ryan K. Buchanan. “His sentence reflects the scope of his criminal conduct.”
“Fernandez will have many years in prison to think about his long list of crimes and greed.  He not only hurt business owners in need of the Covid relief funding, but even stole the identities of family members,” said Keri Farley, Special Agent in Charge of FBI Atlanta. “With our law enforcement partners, we will continue to identify and hold accountable anyone who violates the law to siphon money from these programs into their own pockets.”
“People who commit PPP fraud and identity theft can expect to be held accountable just as Jose Fernandez has,” said Lisa Fontanette, acting Special Agent in Charge, IRS Criminal Investigation, Atlanta Field Office. “We will continue working with our law enforcement partners to bring to justice individuals who commit these types of crimes that financially harm honest law-abiding citizens and defrauds the U.S. Government.”
“This sentencing holds the defendant in this case accountable for seeking to fraudulently obtain millions of dollars from the Paycheck Protection Program, the IRS, and our Nation’s financial institutions,” said Special Agent in Charge Kyle A. Myles of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC OIG).  “The FDIC OIG remains committed to working with our law enforcement partners to investigate financial crimes and bringing to justice those who threaten to undermine the integrity our Nation’s financial system.”
“The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration aggressively pursues those who endeavor to defraud taxpayer-funded Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act programs, which were established to provide assistance to American business owners during unprecedented times,” stated Inspector General J. Russell George.  “We appreciate the efforts of the U.S. Department of Justice and our law enforcement partners in ensuring individuals engaged in criminal activity are held to account.”
According to U.S. Attorney Buchanan, the charges and other information presented in court: The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES”) is a federal law enacted on March 29, 2020.  It is designed to provide emergency financial assistance to the millions of Americans who are suffering the economic effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. One source of relief provided by the CARES Act was the authorization of up to $349 billion in forgivable loans to small businesses for job retention and certain other expenses through the PPP. In April 2020, Congress authorized over $300 billion in additional PPP funding. Additional funding was authorized by Congress in December 2020. The PPP allows qualifying small businesses and other organizations to receive loans with a maturity of two years and an interest rate of one percent. PPP loan proceeds must be used by businesses on payroll costs, interest on mortgages, rent, and utilities.  The PPP allows the interest and principal to be forgiven if businesses spend the proceeds on these expenses within eight weeks of receipt and use at least 75 percent of the forgiven amount for payroll.
Fernandez operated multiple small businesses in the metro-Atlanta area from at least as early as 2016 through 2020. Fernandez submitted multiple PPP applications on behalf of several companies controlled by him or his associates that contained materially false information about the companies’ total number of employees, corporate expenses, and revenue. As a result of these false applications, he received over $1.6 million in fraudulent PPP funds. He then used these fraudulently obtained funds to make unauthorized expenditures, including purchases of a home, automobiles, and additional personal items.
Fernandez, who operated a tax preparation business for several years, also stole thousands of identities of his own clients, and of other individuals from a medical supply company, to file false tax returns claiming over $2 million in fraudulent refunds. The IRS was able to stop the vast majority of these funds from being issued to Fernandez.
In addition, Fernandez committed fraud against financial institutions. He obtained fraudulent credit cards in the names of family members and identity theft victims, which he then used to make hundreds of thousands of dollars in fraudulent purchases. Finally, Fernandez obtained blank check stock that was to be used to print tax refund checks for his tax preparation business clients.  He used those checks to attempt to fraudulently write more than $900,000 worth of checks to businesses under his control and to pay personal expenses and debt.
Jose Fernandez, 36, of Winter Haven, Florida, has been sentenced to five years and ten months in prison to be followed by three years of supervised release.  Fernandez was charged in a five-count criminal information on January 25, 2023, and pleaded guilty.
This case was investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General, and the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration. Also, the Gwinnett County Police Department provided substantial assistance in this investigation.
Assistant U.S. Attorneys Thomas J. Krepp and Tracia M. King prosecuted the case.

U.S. Attorney Announces Participation in Coordinated National Health Care Fraud Enforcement Action,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/us-attorney-announces-participation-coordinated-national-health,"June 28, 2023",2023,"MIAMI – U.S. Attorney Markenzy Lapointe announced criminal charges against fourteen defendants in connection with over $1.9 billion in fraud prosecuted in the Southern District of Florida, as part of the Department of Justice’s 2023 National Health Care Fraud Enforcement Action. The charges stem from various schemes to defraud government and private health care benefit programs by submitting false claims for items and services that were not needed and, in many instances, never provided as well as a scheme to unlawfully distribute adulterated and misbranded prescription medications.
“The results of this nationwide coordinated law enforcement effort that we announce today exemplify our office’s ongoing commitment to prosecuting health care fraud-related schemes,” said U.S. Attorney Markenzy Lapointe for the Southern District of Florida. “We will continue to hold accountable those who exploit health care programs for personal profit in South Florida.”
“These enforcement actions, including against one of the largest health care fraud schemes ever prosecuted by the Justice Department, represent our intensified efforts to combat fraud and prosecute the individuals who profit from it,” said Attorney General Merrick B. Garland. “The Justice Department will find and bring to justice criminals who seek to defraud Americans and steal from taxpayer-funded programs.”
“This nationwide enforcement action demonstrates that the Criminal Division is committed to fighting health care fraud and opioid abuse by prosecuting those who allegedly exploit patients and health care benefit programs for personal gain,” said Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Polite, Jr. of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. “Today’s announcement includes some of the largest and most complex cases that the Department has prosecuted, and demonstrates the Department’s commitment to seeking justice for those at all levels of the healthcare industry who put profits above patient care, from professionals in doctors’ offices to executives in corporate boardrooms.”
The charges announced today by U.S. Attorney Lapointe are part of a strategically coordinated, two-week nationwide law enforcement action that resulted in criminal charges against 78 defendants for their alleged participation in health care fraud and opioid abuse schemes that resulted in the submission of over $2.5 billion in alleged false billings. The defendants allegedly defrauded programs entrusted for the care of the elderly and disabled, and, in some cases, used the proceeds of the schemes to purchase luxury items, including exotic automobiles and yachts.

“Federal health care programs are designed to provide access to high quality care to patients nationwide. When bad actors attempt to exploit those measures for illicit financial gain, they put greed before the needs and safety of their patients, and take valuable resources away from their intended recipients,” said Deputy Inspector General for Investigations Christian J. Schrank of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (HHS-OIG). “As today’s enforcement action illustrates, HHS-OIG and our law enforcement partners are committed to defending the federal health care system against fraud.”
“These cases serve to highlight the magnitude of health care fraud in South Florida, but unfortunately are only the tip of the iceberg,” said Jeffrey B. Veltri, Special Agent in Charge, FBI Miami. “Our health care system is under constant attack by fraudsters who are driven by greed. They pilfer billions of dollars from Medicare and other health care benefit programs. The FBI, Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General, Department of Defense Office of Inspector General, the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida, and the Department of Justice devote considerable resources to investigate, arrest, and prosecute these criminals.

Richmond of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC-OIG). “We will continue to coordinate with our law enforcement partners to investigate such schemes, and are pleased to join them in announcing today’s enforcement action.""

HHS-OIG Miami, DOD-OIG, Southeast Field Office, FDIC-OIG, Atlanta Region, and HSI Miami investigated the case. Assistant U.S. Attorney Will J. Rosenzweig is prosecuting it.

As alleged in the indictment, Blackman, Cox, and Schreck owned, controlled, or operated DMERx, which was an internet-based platform that the defendants programmed to generate false and fraudulent doctors’ orders in exchange for illegal kickbacks and bribes. Cox was the CEO of the company that operated DMERx prior to a corporate acquisition, and Blackman was the CEO and Schreck a Vice President of the company that operated it after the acquisition. The defendants are alleged to have offered to connect pharmacies, durable medical equipment (“DME”) suppliers, and marketers to telemedicine companies who would accept illegal kickbacks and bribes in exchange for orders that were transmitted using the DMERx platform. The defendants allegedly received payments for coordinating these illegal kickback transactions and referring the completed doctors’ orders to the DME suppliers, pharmacies, and telemarketers that paid for them. The fraudulent orders and prescriptions generated by DMERx falsely represented that doctors had examined and treated the Medicare beneficiaries when in reality, purported telemedicine companies paid doctors to sign these orders and prescriptions without regard to medical necessity and based on a brief telephone call with the beneficiary or sometimes no interaction with the beneficiary at all. In order to conceal and disguise the scheme, and obstruct investigations by Medicare and its contractors, the defendants allegedly removed references to telemedicine in the orders. The DME supply companies and pharmacies that paid illegal kickbacks in exchange for these orders and prescriptions generated through DMERx billed Medicare more than $1,963,000,000 in false and fraudulent claims. HHS-OIG Miami, FBI Miami, VA-OIG, Southeast Field Office, IRS-CI Miami, HSI Miami, OPM-OIG, DOD OIG, Southeast Field Office, investigated the case. Trial Attorneys Darren C.

As alleged in the information, Herrera and his co-conspirators illegally acquired these prescription medications through fraud or from individual patients for whom the prescription medications had been prescribed. The information alleges that these medications were then repackaged and resold with false labeling and documentation to conceal their true origin. It further alleges that, in some instances, the prescription medications Herrera distributed contained the wrong medication. HHS-OIG Miami and FDIC-OIG, Atlanta Region, investigated the case. Trial Attorney Alexander Thor Pogozelski of the Miami Strike Force is prosecuting it. Assistant U.S. Attorney Daren Grove is handling asset forfeiture.
In United States v. Vines , Case No. 23-cr-80107, Reginal N. Vines, 47, of Tuscaloosa, Alabama, was charged by indictment with conspiracy to commit health care fraud and wire fraud, health care fraud, conspiracy to defraud the United States and to pay and receive health care kickbacks, and receiving health care kickbacks, in connection with his role in selling doctors’ orders for medically unnecessary genetic tests to several laboratories. Vines obtained the orders by paying kickbacks and bribes to a doctor in exchange for the doctor signing prescriptions for genetic tests, without ever meeting or treating the Medicare beneficiaries for whom the tests were orders. In some instances, Vines allegedly forged the doctor’s signature on the prescriptions. The indictment alleges that the laboratories billed Medicare approximately $10 million for medically unnecessary genetic tests, of which Medicare paid $2.9 million. HHS-OIG Miami and FBI Miami investigated the case. Trial Attorney Reginald Cuyler Jr. of the Miami Strike Force is prosecuting it. Assistant U.S. Attorney Marx Calderon is handling asset forfeiture.
In addition to the above defendants charged in the Southern District of Florida, a defendant was sentenced earlier this month to 15 years in federal prison in connection with a nationwide scheme to unlawfully distribute diverted, adulterated, and misbranded medications, including HIV drugs:
In United States v. Hernandez , Case No. 22-cr-60129, Lazaro Hernandez, 52, of Miami, Florida, was sentenced on June 15 to 15 years in prison after pleading guilty to conspiracy to defraud the United States and to introduce into interstate commerce adulterated and misbranded drugs and conspiracy to commit money laundering, in connection with a nationwide scheme to unlawfully distribute more than $230 million in diverted, adulterated, and misbranded medications, including HIV drugs. According to court documents, Hernandez and his co-conspirators illegally acquired large quantities of prescription drugs from patients for whom the drugs had been prescribed but intentionally not consumed. Hernandez and his co-conspirators then sold the diverted drugs to pharmacies across the country. The diverted drugs were accompanied by false pedigrees to conceal their true origin. In at least several instances, the diverted HIV medication that Hernandez sold consisted of bottles containing the wrong medication, broken pills, and even pebbles, leading to complaints by pharmacies. Hernandez and his co-conspirators then laundered the proceeds of these illegal sales. Hernandez also used his share of the proceeds to purchase luxury goods, including a $280,000 Lamborghini, a $220,000 Mercedes, and three boats. HHS-OIG Miami and FDIC-OIG, Atlanta Region, investigated the case. Assistant U.S. Attorney Timothy J. Abraham and Trial Attorney Alexander Thor Pogozelski of the Miami Strike Force prosecuted it. Assistant U.S. Attorney Emily Stone is handling asset forfeiture.

National Enforcement Action Results in 78 Individuals Charged for $2.5B in Health Care Fraud,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/national-enforcement-action-results-78-individuals-charged-25b,"June 28, 2023",2023,"The Justice Department, together with federal and state law enforcement partners, announced today a strategically coordinated, two-week nationwide law enforcement action that resulted in criminal charges against 78 defendants for their alleged participation in health care fraud and opioid abuse schemes that included over $2.5 billion in alleged fraud.
The defendants allegedly defrauded programs entrusted for the care of the elderly and disabled, and, in some cases, used the proceeds of the schemes to purchase luxury items, including exotic automobiles, jewelry, and yachts. In connection with the enforcement action, the Department seized or restrained millions of dollars in cash, automobiles, and real estate.
“These enforcement actions, including against one of the largest health care fraud schemes ever prosecuted by the Justice Department, represent our intensified efforts to combat fraud and prosecute the individuals who profit from it,” said Attorney General Merrick B. Garland. “The Justice Department will find and bring to justice criminals who seek to defraud Americans and steal from taxpayer-funded programs.”
“This nationwide enforcement action demonstrates that the Criminal Division is committed to fighting health care fraud and opioid abuse by prosecuting those who allegedly exploit patients and health care benefit programs for personal gain,” said Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Polite, Jr. of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. “Today’s announcement includes some of the largest and most complex cases that the Department has prosecuted, and demonstrates the Department’s commitment to seeking justice for those at all levels of the healthcare industry who put profits above patient care, from professionals in doctors’ offices to executives in corporate boardrooms.”
“Health care fraud is a complex and ever-evolving threat that negatively impacts the American people,” said Assistant Director Luis Quesada of the FBI’s Criminal Investigative Division. “Today’s nationwide coordinated law enforcement action is a testament to the tenacity of the FBI and our partners, as well as our combined efforts to pursue anyone who conspires to exploit our health care system for financial gain.”
“Patients trust federal health care programs to provide high quality care. When bad actors steal from these programs, they hurt patients,” said Inspector General Christi A. Grimm of the Department of Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General (HHS-OIG). “HHS-OIG is dedicated to protecting federal health care programs and putting patients first. Thank you to our law enforcement partners, especially the Medicaid Fraud Control Units, that participated in this effort.”
“At the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), we are committed to protecting the safety and health of all Americans,” said DEA Administrator Anne Milgram. “When individuals divert addictive opioid medications for personal gain, they are knowingly putting Americans at risk, all too often causing harm and even death. DEA is committed to taking decisive action to hold accountable anyone who participates in these dangerous schemes.”
“The Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs (CHAMPVA) provides community health care to family members of our nation’s disabled or deceased veterans, and the defendants’ alleged criminal actions resulted in a multibillion-dollar fraud scheme that puts those benefits at risk and pilfers significant taxpayer funds,” said Inspector General Michael J. Missal of the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Inspector General (VA-OIG). “The VA-OIG’s continued oversight of VA’s multiple healthcare programs, including CHAMPVA, is one of the agency’s highest priorities. We thank our outstanding law enforcement partners for their efforts in this investigation.”
Telemedicine Fraud
The enforcement action included charges against 11 defendants in connection with the submission of over $2 billion in fraudulent claims resulting from telemedicine schemes. In a case involving the alleged organizers of one of the largest health care fraud schemes ever prosecuted, an indictment in the Southern District of Florida alleges that the chief executive officer (CEO), former CEO, and Vice President of Business Development of purported software and services companies conspired to generate and sell templated doctors’ orders for orthotic braces and pain creams in exchange for kickbacks and bribes. The conspiracy allegedly resulted in the submission of $1.9 billion in false and fraudulent claims to Medicare and other government insurers for orthotic braces, prescription skin creams, and other items that were medically unnecessary and ineligible for Medicare reimbursement.
As part of the alleged conspiracy, individuals in a massive telemarketing operation, located in the United States and abroad, targeted the elderly and disabled with direct mail, television advertisements, and other forms of advertising to induce them to contact offshore boiler-rooms staffed by individuals who “up-sold” the elderly and disabled on unnecessary medical equipment and prescriptions. According to the indictment, the software platform that the defendants allegedly operated was actually a conduit for these telemarketers to coordinate the payment of illegal kickbacks and bribes to telemedicine companies to obtain doctors’ orders for Medicare beneficiaries. The defendants allegedly programmed the software platform to generate false and fraudulent orders for telemedicine practitioners to sign and obstruct Medicare investigations by concealing that the interactions with beneficiaries had occurred remotely using telemedicine. The program-generated orders falsified certifications that the telemedicine doctors had examined the beneficiaries in person, and falsified diagnostic testing that Medicare required for brace orders. After the original CEO sold the company in a corporate acquisition, the new corporate leadership allegedly chose to continue the pre-existing fraud scheme.
In another telemedicine fraud case, in the Eastern District of Washington, a licensed physician was charged for signing more than 2800 fraudulent orders for orthotic braces, including for patients whose limbs had already been amputated. As alleged, the physician took less than 40 seconds to review and sign each order.
The cases announced today build on earlier telemedicine enforcement actions involving over $10.1 billion in fraud. The April 2019 Operation Brace Yourself Telemedicine and Durable Medical Equipment Takedown alone resulted in an estimated cost avoidance of more than $1.9 billion in the amount Medicare paid for orthotic braces in the 20 months following that enforcement action, preserving the Medicare trust fund for necessary medical care.
Pharmaceutical Fraud
The enforcement action also included charges against 10 defendants in connection with the submission of over $370 million in fraudulent claims submitted in connection with prescription drugs. In one case announced today, the owner and corporate officer of a pharmaceutical wholesale distribution company was charged for an alleged $150 million fraud scheme in which the company purchased illegally diverted prescription HIV medication, and then marketed and resold the medication by falsely representing that the company acquired it through legitimate channels. The defendant allegedly purchased the diverted medication at a substantial discount from individuals who obtained the drugs primarily through illegal “buyback” schemes in which they paid HIV patients cash for their expensive HIV medication and repackaged those pills for resale. To cover up their scheme, the defendant and others falsified labeling and product tracing documentation to make it appear legitimate. Pharmacies purchased the misbranded medications, dispensed them to patients, and billed them to health care benefit programs, all while the defendants reaped substantial illegal profits.
In a related case, on June 15, an individual in the Southern District of Florida was sentenced to 15 years in prison for his role in this nationwide scheme. According to court documents, the defendant illegally acquired large quantities of prescription drugs from patients for whom the drugs had been prescribed but not yet consumed. The defendant and others then repackaged the drugs and sold them to wholesale companies. In some instances, the medication that the defendant sold contained the wrong medication, broken pills, and even pebbles, leading to complaints by pharmacies.

"CFO, Controller, Corporate Officers Charged in $53 Million Fraud Scheme Involving Pandemic Relief",https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/cfo-controller-corporate-officers-charged-53-million-fraud,"June 28, 2023",2023,"Fourteen people who allegedly bilked the Paycheck Protection Program, a COVID-era financial program, and numerous financial institutions out of more than $53 million in loan proceeds have been federally charged, announced U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Texas Leigha Simonton. This case is the largest investigated by the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee (PRAC) Fraud Task Force to date.
The defendants were arrested Tuesday and Wednesday in Texas, California, and Oklahoma by special agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Treasury Department’s Special Inspector General for Pandemic Recovery (SIGPR), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of Inspector General (FDIC-OIG).
“Defrauding the government is an affront to American taxpayers. Defrauding the government during a pandemic – at a time when millions of hardworking entrepreneurs struggled to make payroll and rent – is pouring salt in a wound,” said U.S. Attorney Leigha Simonton. “These defendants allegedly conspired to steal tens of millions of dollars from the Paycheck Protection Program – funds which could have helped legitimate businesses pay their bills and keep their employees afloat. We are thankful to the officers and agents who meticulously investigated this case, especially the data scientists at the Pandemic Analytics Center of Excellence, whose sophisticated analysis ensures that those who abused the PPP will be brought to justice.”
“These indictments charge another group of individuals with defrauding the taxpayers of millions of dollars as the group abused a federal program critical for struggling small businesses that were hit hard by the pandemic,” said Brian Miller, the Special Inspector General for Pandemic Recovery. “SIGPR is glad to have played a significant role teaming with other law enforcement agencies and the United States Attorney’s Office to hold these individuals accountable.”
According to a series of indictments unsealed Wednesday, several of the charged defendants purportedly operated a group of affiliated recycling companies, including Mammoth Metal Recycling, Elephant Recycling, Gulf Coast Scrap, 4G Metals, 4G Plastics, 5G Metals, Level Eight, Sunshine Recycling, L.K. Industries, , NTC Industries, West Texas Equipment, and West Texas Scrap.
They allegedly submitted at least 29 Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan applications that fraudulently inflated payroll expenses, doctoring bank statements and Internal Revenue Service tax forms to falsely reflect business income. They then routed PPP loan funds through a series of bank accounts to create a false paper trail of payroll expenses.
At least two of the defendants also allegedly submitted false applications to financial institutions on behalf of their purported recycling companies to fraudulently obtain, in the aggregate, millions of dollars in business loan proceeds.
And one defendant allegedly lied to the Federal Deposit Insurance Commission (FDIC) by stating that he did not know several of his other alleged coconspirators.
Those charged in the sixteen count-indictment filed last week include:
Those charged in separate indictments include:
An indictment is merely an allegation of criminal conduct, not evidence. All defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty in a court of law.
If convicted, the defendants face up to 30 years in federal prison for each count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud, bank fraud and aiding and abetting, bank fraud, and making a false statement to the FDIC, 20 years for wire fraud, and 10 years for conspiracy to commit money laundering.
This case was investigated by a SIGPR special agent assigned to the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee (PRAC) Fraud Task Force, and special agents from the Dallas field offices of the FDIC OIG and FBI.  Assistant United States Attorney Fabio Leonardi is prosecuting the case.
The PRAC was established to promote transparency and facilitate coordinated oversight of the federal government’s COVID-19 pandemic response. The PRAC’s 21 member Inspectors General identify major risks that cross program and agency boundaries to detect fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement in the more than $5 trillion in COVID-19 spending, including spending via the Paycheck Protection Program. This case was also supported by the PRAC’s Pandemic Analytics Center of Excellence , which applies the latest advances in analytic and forensic technologies to help OIGs and law enforcement pursue data-driven pandemic relief fraud investigations.
The Paycheck Protection Program was authorized under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, a federal law enacted on March 29, 2020, to provide emergency financial assistance to Americans suffering economic hardship due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The PPP provided forgivable loans to small businesses to cover payroll, rent, and other certain business expenses; the program ended in May 2021.

Greenbelt , Maryland – U.S. District Judge Theodore D. Chuang today sentenced Jerry Phillips, a/k/a “Tian Juzo,” age 25, of Capitol Heights, Maryland, to seven years in federal prison, followed by three years of supervised release, for a wire fraud conspiracy, aggravated identity theft, and illegal possession of a machine gun, related to a scheme to fraudulently obtain more than $1 million in COVID-19 CARES Act Paycheck Protection Program loan applications (“PPP”), Economic Injury Disaster loan applications (“EIDL”), and unemployment insurance claims.  Judge Chuang also ordered Phillips to pay restitution of $1,235,213.
The sentence was announced by Erek L. Barron, United States Attorney for the District of Maryland; Acting Special Agent in Charge Troy W. Springer, of the National Capital Region, U.S. Department of Labor - Office of Inspector General (“DOL-OIG”); Acting Special Agent in Charge Kareem A. Carter of the Internal Revenue Service - Criminal Investigation (“IRS-CI”), Washington, D.C. Field Office; Special Agent in Charge Amaleka McCall-Brathwaite of the Small Business Administration - Office of Inspector General (“SBA-OIG”), Eastern Region, and Special Agent in Charge Jeffrey D. Pittano, of the Mid-Atlantic Region, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (“FDIC-OIG”).
“Once again, the Maryland U.S. Attorney’s Office’s COVID fraud enforcement strategy is taking illegal guns out of the hands of criminals,” said United States Attorney Erek L. Barron.  “This case highlights two of our office priorities—taking illegal guns off the streets and holding accountable those who fraudulently took advantage of the COVID-19 pandemic to line their pockets.”
According to his plea agreement, from March 2020 to February 2022, Phillips worked with his brother and co-defendant, Jaleel Phillips, and at least one other person. to fraudulently obtain COVID-19 related benefits, including filing fraudulent PPP loan applications, EIDL loan applications, and unemployment insurance claims.  As detailed in the statement of facts, Phillips and his co-conspirators created fictitious aliases, used the personal identifying information of real people, and used defunct corporate entities or new business entities with no actual business operations to apply for PPP and EIDL loans, and unemployment benefits.
As part of the scheme, Phillips admitted that he created and used multiple fake identities to submit fraudulent PPP and EIDL loan applications and used the personal identifying information of more than 20 real people in furtherance of fraudulent unemployment claims.  The fraudulently obtained PPP and EIDL loans and unemployment insurance claims were deposited into the bank accounts opened in the names of the aliases.  The money was then withdrawn by Phillips and his co-conspirators through ATM withdrawals and purchases made on the associated debit and credit cards or transferred between the various financial accounts established in the aliases’ names.  Phillips used $65,538.95 of the fraudulently obtained funds to purchase a 2020 Chevrolet Camaro, which he registered in his name at the Maryland Motor Vehicle Administration.  Jerry Phillips also admitted that he personally obtained and controlled more than $1 million in fraud proceeds from the fraudulent PPPs and EIDLs.
A search of the defendant’s residence recovered more than 25 fake driver’s licenses from multiple states and multiple identification documents from different jurisdictions with Jerry Phillips’ photograph and the same alias.  Law enforcement also recovered four “ghost guns” which Jerry Phillips purchased online, using an alias.  Phillips admitted that he illegally modified one of the ghost guns into a machine gun capable of firing multiple rounds with one pull of the trigger.
Jaleel Phillips, age 25, of Capitol Heights, Maryland, previously pleaded guilty to his role in the wire fraud conspiracy and was sentenced on June 22, 2023, to 30 months in federal prison and was ordered to pay restitution in the amount of $1,142,769.

Two Loan Brokers Plead Guilty to Bank Fraud Scheme,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/two-loan-brokers-plead-guilty-bank-fraud-scheme,"June 16, 2023",2023,"Defendants charged borrowers fees for fraudulent loan applications they submitted using fabricated information
BOSTON – Two operators of a loan brokerage businesses pleaded guilty yesterday today in federal court in Boston to conspiring to defraud a Massachusetts-based bank and the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA).
Ted Capodilupo, 57, of South Easton, and Joseph Masci, 71, of Boston, pleaded guilty to one count each of conspiracy to commit bank fraud. U.S. Senior District Court Judge Mark L. Wolf scheduled sentencing for Sept. 8, 2023. The defendants were charged in January 2022 along with co-conspirator Brian Ferris, a loan officer at a Massachusetts-based bank.
Between 2015 and 2018, Capodilupo, Masci and Ferris agreed to defraud the bank and the SBA by submitting fraudulent loan applications to the bank, which administered the SBA’s small business express loan program, to secure bank loans guaranteed by the SBA. Specifically, Capodilupo and Masci submitted dozens of fraudulent loan applications to the bank on behalf of borrowers who were ineligible for traditional business loans. These loan applications misrepresented, among other things, the identity of the real loan recipients and the businesses for which the loans were sought.
Capodilupo and Masci also fabricated federal tax forms submitted in support of the fraudulent loan applications, falsified applicant signatures and falsely indicated that no broker had assisted in preparing or referring the loan applications. Capodilupo and Masci charged borrowers fees for obtaining these fraudulent loans. Ferris, who worked as a loan officer at the bank, caused the bank to issue loans for which Capodilupo and Masci submitted applications and received a kickback from Capodilupo and Masci of approximately $500 per loan. The scheme generated approximately $270,000 in fees for Capodilupo and Masci. Many of the loans that the bank issued as a result of the fraudulent applications ultimately defaulted, resulting in substantial losses to the bank.
On April 21, 2023, Ferris pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud. He is scheduled to be sentenced on Aug. 3, 2023.
The charge of conspiracy to commit bank fraud provides for a sentence of up to 30 years in prison; five years of supervised release; a fine of up to $1 million or twice the gross gain or loss, whichever is greater; restitution; and forfeiture. Sentences are imposed by a federal district court judge based upon the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and statutes which govern the determination of a sentence in a criminal case.

Levy; Patricia Tarasca, Special Agent in Charge of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC-OIG), New York Region; Christopher DiMenna, Acting Special Agent in Charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Boston Division; Brian Tucker, Special Agent-in-Charge, Eastern Region, Office of Inspector General for the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection; and Amaleka McCall-Brathwaite, Special Agent in Charge of SBA OIG’s Eastern Region, made the announcement.

Former Bank Employee Sentenced to Three Years in Federal Prison for Fraudulently Opening Bank Accounts as Part of a Larger Bank Fraud Scheme Targeting Churches and Religious Organizations,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/former-bank-employee-sentenced-three-years-federal-prison,"June 2, 2023",2023,"Accepted Cash Bribes to Open the Accounts From Co-Conspirators Engaged in Check Fraud and Rental Car Fraud Schemes
G reenbelt, Maryland – U.S. District Judge Theodore D. Chuang today sentenced Diape Seck, age 29, of Rockville, Maryland, to three years in federal prison, followed by three years of supervised release, for his role in a bank fraud scheme in which he and his co-conspirators obtained or attempted to obtain almost $2 million by fraud, including the theft of checks from the mail of churches and religious institutions.  Judge Chuang also ordered Seck to pay restitution in the amount of $1,708,446.49, and to forfeit $114,647.50.  A federal jury convicted Seck on February 24, 2023.
The sentence was announced by Erek L. Barron, United States Attorney for the District of Maryland; Postal Inspector in Charge Damon E. Wood of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service - Washington Division; Special Agent in Charge James C. Harris of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Baltimore; Special Agent in Charge Jeffrey D. Pittano of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of Inspector General (FDIC-OIG); Chief Marcus Jones of the Montgomery County Police Department; Chief Terry Sult of the Cary, North Carolina, Police Department; and Sheriff Dusty Rhoades of the Williamson County, Tennessee, Sheriff’s Office.
According to the evidence presented at his eight-day trial, from at least January 2019 to January 2020, Seck, a customer service representative with Bank A, conspired with Mateus Vaduva, Marius Vaduva, Vlad Baceanu, Nicolae Gindac, Florin Vaduva, Marian Unguru, Daniel Velcu, Vali Unguru and others to commit bank fraud.  Specifically, the evidence showed that Seck fraudulently opened bank accounts in fake identities in exchange for cash bribes.  Co-conspirators engaged in fraud that included fraud involving rental cars and the deposit of checks stolen from the incoming and outgoing mail of churches and other religious institutions, into the fraudulently opened bank accounts.  The co-conspirators then withdrew the funds and spent the fraudulently obtained proceeds.
As detailed in the trial evidence, Diape Seck facilitated the opening of hundreds of bank accounts at Bank A for his co-conspirators, who used purported foreign identities, often but not universally Romanian, to fraudulently open bank accounts with him at Bank A, as well as bank accounts at other victim financial institutions.  Seck opened accounts for co-conspirators without their presence in the bank, without verifying identity information, and opened accounts for co-conspirators who opened multiple accounts at a time under different identities.  To conceal his improper activities, Seck opened accounts for the co-conspirators at the same time he conducted legitimate bank activities.  The co-conspirators paid Seck up to $500 in cash in exchange for each of the fraudulent bank accounts he opened.
According to court documents and witness testimony, Seck violated numerous bank policies in opening approximately 412 checking accounts in a one-year period from approximately January 2, 2019 through January 3, 2020, relying predominantly on purported Romanian passports and driver's license information.  Checks payable to and written from churches and other religious institutions from around the country were deposited into many of the 412 checking accounts which were not opened in the names of the churches.
The co-conspirators fraudulently negotiated the stolen checks by depositing them into the victim bank accounts, including the fraudulent accounts opened by Seck at Bank A, often by way of automated teller machine (ATM) transactions.   After depositing the stolen checks into the bank accounts, the conspirators made cash withdrawals from ATMs and purchases using debit cards associated with the bank accounts.  Co-conspirators also used fraudulently obtained debit cards to rent cars which they used and then failed to return, resulting in charges by the rental car companies which had to be “written off” by Bank A.
According to court documents, co-conspirators deposited at least approximately $780,064.04 in stolen checks into the accounts Seck personally opened on their behalf and the bank had to write off at least approximately $921,590.50 from the co-conspirators’ rental car fraud in the accounts Seck opened for them.
Co-conspirators Vlad Baceanu, age 38; Marian Unguru, age 36; and Vali Unguru, age 20, all of Baltimore, Maryland, previously pled guilty to conspiracy to commit bank fraud and wire fraud.  Mateus Vaduva, age 29, of Baltimore was sentenced to five years in federal prison and ordered to pay restitution of $1,320,885.84; Nicolae Gindac, age 52, of Dania Beach, Florida was sentenced to 54 months in federal prison and ordered to pay restitution of $1,096,660.11; Florin Vaduva, age 31, of Dania Beach, Florida was sentenced to 51 months in federal prison and ordered to pay restitution of $1,096,660.11; Marius Vaduva, age 28, of Baltimore was sentenced to 42 months in federal prison and ordered to pay restitution of $1,334,230.84; and Daniel Velcu, age 43, of Baltimore was sentenced to 34 months in federal prison and ordered to pay restitution of $1,313,499.79, after they previously pled guilty to conspiracy to commit bank fraud and wire fraud.
United States Attorney Erek L. Barron commended the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, HSI, the FDIC Office of Inspector General, the Montgomery County Police Department, the Cary (North Carolina) Police Department, and the Williamson County (Tennessee) Sheriff’s Office for their work in the investigation.  Mr. Barron thanked Assistant U.S. Attorneys Elizabeth Wright and Darren Gardner, who prosecuted the case.

Atlantic County Resident Admits Laundering Proceeds of COVID-19 Small Business Relief Program Fraud,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/atlantic-county-resident-admits-laundering-proceeds-covid-19,"June 2, 2023",2023,"CAMDEN, N.J. – An Atlantic County, New Jersey, man admitted laundering the proceeds of fraudulently obtained Paycheck Protection Program loans, U.S. Attorney Philip R. Sellinger announced today.
Jeremy Earley, 41, of Egg Harbor Township, New Jersey, and Lilburn, Georgia, pleaded guilty on June 1, 2023, before U.S. District Judge Karen M. Williams in Camden federal court to an information charging him with one count of engaging in a monetary transaction in criminally derived property.
According to documents filed in this case and statements made in court:
In 2020 and 2021, two companies owned by Earley received loans totaling more than $1.3 million from the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), a federal program that provided  forgivable loans to small businesses for job retention and certain other expenses. The loans were approved based on fraudulent applications submitted by conspirator Rhonda Thomas stating that the companies had dozens of employees and monthly payrolls of $145,000 and $382,400, respectively. The applications also contained forged tax forms. In fact, Earley’s businesses had no employees other than himself and paid minimal to no wages.

"Former KC Bank Manager Indicted for Facilitating Covid Fraud Scheme, Unemployment Benefits Fraud Scheme",https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/former-kc-bank-manager-indicted-facilitating-covid-fraud-scheme,"June 1, 2023",2023,"Accepted Chiefs Playoff Tickets, Chevrolet Tahoe to Facilitate $12.4 Million Covid Fraud Scheme by Jefferson City Business Owner
JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. – A former bank branch manager in Kansas City, Mo., has been indicted by a federal grand jury for accepting Kansas City Chiefs playoffs tickets and a new Chevrolet Tahoe in exchange for facilitating a $12.4 million Covid fraud scheme by a Jefferson City, Mo., business owner, as well as a separate fraud scheme to receive unemployment benefits.
Anthony Omar Brockman, 48, who currently resides in Bennington, Nebraska, was charged in an eight-count indictment returned under seal by a federal grand jury in Jefferson City, Mo., on Tuesday, May 30. That indictment was unsealed and made public today following Brockman’s arrest.
Brockman was the branch manager of the Truman Hospital location of US Bank in Kansas City, Mo., until the COVID-19 pandemic caused the bank branch to close. Brockman was reassigned to US Bank’s Paycheck Protection Program project from April 12 through July 19, 2020. Brockman was then returned to his role as on-site manager at the Truman Hospital bank branch until May 22, 2021.
On March 27, 2020, The CARES Act established several new temporary programs and provided for the expansion of others to address the COVID-19 pandemic. Among these programs, the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) authorized forgivable loans to small businesses to retain workers and maintain payroll, make mortgage interest payments, lease payments, and utility payments.
The indictment alleges that Brockman assisted and facilitated fraudulent PPP loan applications for Tod Ray Keilholz, the owner of TRK Construction, LLC, TRK Valpo, LLC, TL Builders, LLC, and Project Design, LLC, in Jefferson City. Keilholz has been charged in a separate indictment for his role in a more than $27.1 million bank fraud scheme that included more than $12.4 million in PPP loans for his businesses.
According to that separate indictment, Keilholz received a total of $12,430,932 in PPP loans for his four businesses. In each of those loan applications, the indictment says, Keilholz failed to disclose his ownership in the other three businesses, and made materially false and fraudulent claims in the loan applications and supporting documentation. Keilholz allegedly inflated the income of those businesses and claimed payrolls for employees who did not exist or no longer worked for him.
Brockman is charged with two counts of receiving gifts in exchange for assisting Keilholz in procuring those loans. On Nov. 4, 2020, Keilholz allegedly used PPP loan proceeds to pay for a 2021 Chevrolet Tahoe that he gave to Brockman. On Jan. 18, 2021, Keilholz allegedly used PPP loan proceeds to purchase tickets to the Jan. 24, 2021, AFC Championship Game between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Buffalo Bills. These gifts, the indictment says, were intended to influence and reward Brockman in connection with Keilholz’s applications for PPP loans and Keilholz’s applications for the forgiveness of PPP loans.
The indictment also charges Brockman with one count of money laundering. Brockman allegedly signed an affidavit gifting the 2021 Chevrolet Tahoe to Rich Girl, Rich Boy Prep, Inc., a charity of which his wife was the Chief Executive Officer. On May 25, 2021, Brockman transferred the title to the Tahoe to Rich Girl, Rich Boy Prep but continued to drive the Tahoe until he sold it in July 2022.
The indictment charges Brockman with five counts of wire fraud related to a scheme to receive $11,040 in unemployment benefits from March 27, 2020, to Nov. 4, 2021, while he was employed by US Bank.
The charges contained in this indictment are simply accusations, and not evidence of guilt. Evidence supporting the charges must be presented to a federal trial jury, whose duty is to determine guilt or innocence.
This case is being prosecuted by Supervisory Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael S. Oliver. It was investigated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau-Office of Inspector General, the Small Business Administration-Office of Inspector General, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)-Office of Inspector General, the FBI, and IRS-Criminal Investigation.

"PAR FUNDING PRINCIPALS CHARGED WITH SECURITIES FRAUD, EXTORTION, TAX CRIMES, PERJURY, AND OBSTRUCTION",https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/par-funding-principals-charged-securities-fraud-extortion-tax,"May 24, 2023",2023,"PHILADELPHIA – An indictment was unsealed today charging Complete Business Solutions Group, Inc., doing business as Par Funding, and four of its principals with various crimes, including securities fraud, extortionate collection of credit, tax crimes, perjury, obstruction of justice, witness retaliation, and witness tampering, announced United States Attorney Jacqueline C. Romero.  These principals are Joseph LaForte, 52: Lisa McElhone, 43; Joseph Cole Barleta (“Joe Cole”), 39; and James LaForte, 46.
According to the indictment, from at least 2016 through July 2020, co-conspirators Joseph LaForte, Joe Cole, James LaForte, and others participated in a conspiracy to commit wire fraud and securities fraud in connection with funds that were raised from investors in Par Funding and its affiliates.  Par Funding and these affiliates provided funding to businesses through short-term financing transactions, referred to as merchant cash advances (“MCAs”).  To fund these MCAs, the defendants raised over $500 million from investors.
It is alleged that as part of their fundraising efforts, these defendants and their conspirators caused false and misleading information to be conveyed to investors regarding various issues, including:
For instance, the indictment alleges that although Joseph LaForte operated Par Funding and referred to it as his business, he concealed this ownership and control by using his wife, Lisa McElhone, as his nominee.  Joseph LaForte also used several aliases, such as “Joe Mack,” while working at the company.  It is alleged that Joseph LaForte, Joe Cole, James LaForte, and their conspirators engaged in this deception to conceal Joseph LaForte’s true role as the person operating the company and his significant criminal history from investors.
The indictment also alleges that Joseph LaForte and James LaForte conspired with an individual named Renato “Gino” Gioe to participate in the extortionate collection of credit.  It is alleged that during the course of Par Funding’s operations, these individuals made hostile, threatening, and intimidating communications to Par Funding’s customers in person and over the telephone in order to collect on delinquent MCAs.  For example, the indictment alleges that Joseph LaForte threatened to “blow up” a delinquent customer’s home in May 2019 and asked another delinquent customer in August 2019 whether the customer had heard of “cement shoes.”  In addition, the indictment alleges that in May 2018, James LaForte told one customer that he was a “soldier for the family” who had torched people’s cars and kicked people’s teeth in.
Furthermore, the indictment alleges that Joseph LaForte and Lisa McElhone committed a variety of tax crimes.  For instance, it is alleged that the married couple defrauded the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania out of approximately $1.2 million of state taxes by falsely claiming to be residents of Florida, even though they worked, lived, and spent more than 300 days per year in Pennsylvania.  Furthermore, the indictment alleges that Joseph LaForte and Lisa McElhone worked together to evade the payment of half a million dollars of employment taxes that had been imposed on Joseph LaForte in connection with companies that he had operated in the mid-2000s.  In addition, it is alleged that Joseph LaForte committed tax crimes by failing to report millions of dollars in cash kickbacks that he personally received from a Par Funding customer, and by regularly paying cash wages to Par Funding employees but not withholding taxes from these wages or reporting them to the IRS.
It is further alleged that Joseph LaForte and Joe Cole each committed perjury twice during depositions in federal lawsuits against Par Funding, making misrepresentations regarding various matters.  For instance, the indictment alleges that Joseph LaForte lied under oath about his knowledge of his wife’s role at Par Funding, Joe Cole’s role at the company, and the company’s default rate.  The indictment alleges that Joe Cole lied under oath about who was on Par Funding’s credit committee (which Joseph LaForte ran) and who ran Par Funding.
Finally, the indictment alleges that Joseph LaForte and James LaForte engaged in obstruction of justice, witness tampering, and retaliation.  Specifically, it is alleged that in late February 2023, on the streets of Center City Philadelphia, James LaForte, with the assistance of and in coordination with Joseph LaForte, physically assaulted counsel for the Receiver for Par Funding in a lawsuit brought by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in the Southern District of Florida.  Moreover, in connection with the same lawsuit, the indictment alleges that Joseph LaForte threatened to cause serious bodily injury to another individual in November 2022.  Lastly, it is alleged that James LaForte made threats of violence to multiple parties in early 2023 in an effort to interfere with the SEC lawsuit, a federal grand jury investigation, and an anticipated federal prosecution, as well as to retaliate against these parties.
If convicted of all counts charged against them, the defendants face the following maximum possible sentences of imprisonment:  Joseph LaForte – 796 years; McElhone – 70 years; Cole– 415 years; and James LaForte – 615 years.  The defendants also face full restitution, a fine, and a period of supervised release and/or probation.
The case was investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigations, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation-Office of Inspector General, and Pennsylvania State Police and is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys Patrick J. Murray, Matthew Newcomer, and Alexandra Lastowski.  The SEC in Florida investigated and litigated the civil securities fraud charges which formed the basis of a portion of the criminal prosecution.
An indictment is an accusation.  A defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.

Attorney General Bonta Announces President of a Mortgage Company Found Guilty on 100 Felony Counts in $7 Million Statewide Mortgage Fraud Scheme,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/attorney-general-bonta-announces-president-mortgage-company,"May 12, 2023",2023,"Friday, May 12, 2023
Contact: (916) 210-6000, agpressoffice@doj.ca.gov
OAKLAND —  California Attorney General Rob Bonta today announced that the former president of a purported mortgage “investment” company, Robert Sedlar, has been convicted of 100 felony counts for operating a mortgage fraud scheme throughout California. The scheme resulted in a combined loss of over $7 million. The victims, including people who were elderly and in financial distress, sought mortgage relief services from Grand View Financial LLC in the counties of San Diego, San Mateo, Alameda, Contra Costa, San Joaquin, Placer, Solano, Mendocino, San Francisco, El Dorado, and Sacramento. The operators of Grand View Financial—Steven Rogers, Robert Sedlar, and Audrey Gan—were previously indicted by a grand jury in the Sacramento Superior Court for conspiracy, grand theft, elder abuse, filing false or forged documents in a public office, and engaging in a prohibited act as a foreclosure consultant. Steve Rogers and Audrey Gan entered guilty pleas before trial, and Robert Sedlar, president of the company, proceeded to trial in March 2023 on all counts. Today, Robert Sedlar was found guilty of Conspiracy as well as multiple counts of Filing a False Document, Grand Theft, Elder Abuse, and Prohibited Acts by a Foreclosure Consultant. He will be sentenced on July 21, 2023.
“Let this be a strong warning to anyone seeking to steal people’s hard-earned money: We will find you, and we will hold you accountable,” said Attorney General Bonta . “Individuals who prey on vulnerable communities to enrich themselves will be held accountable by the California Department of Justice. My office will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to identify and prosecute those who disregard the rule of law.”
Between 2015 and 2019, the defendants conspired to steal money and homes from distressed homeowners using a company called Grand View Financial LLC. The company advertised assistance to desperate homeowners facing foreclosure. The defendants promised consumers that if they transferred title of their house to Grandview Financial and paid money, the company would eliminate the mortgage lien and deed the home back to the homeowner, clear of any liens. During this time, the defendants filed false court documents, false documents with the county recorders offices, and false bankruptcies that stalled the foreclosures but did nothing to eliminate the liens, all while collecting funds from the victims. Every single victim lost their home as a result.
The indictment and arrests are the result of a joint investigation by the California Department of Justice, Fraud and Special Prosecutions Section and White Collar Investigation Team; the United States Office of Inspector General, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation; the United States Office of Inspector General, Federal Housing Finance Agency; the United States Trustee Program; the United States Marshals Service; the Stanislaus County District Attorney's Office; and the El Dorado County District Attorney’s Office. Also with assistance from from the United States Trustees, Los Angeles Field Office.

"Tallahassee Couple Sentenced To Federal Prison For Wire Fraud Conspiracy, Money Laundering Conspiracy, And Making False Statements Relating To COVID-19 Relief Programs",https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/tallahassee-couple-sentenced-federal-prison-wire-fraud,"May 3, 2023",2023,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Tallahassee Couple Sentenced To Federal Prison For Wire Fraud Conspiracy, Money Laundering Conspiracy, And Making False Statements Relating To COVID-19 Relief Programs
TALLAHASSEE, FLORIDA – Wilbert Jean Stanley, III, 43, and Felicia Jackson Stanley, 43, both of Tallahassee, Florida, were sentenced, after previously pleading guilty to one count each of wire fraud conspiracy, money laundering conspiracy, and making false statements in connection to COVID-19 pandemic relief. Wilbert Stanley was sentenced to 40 months in federal prison, and Felicia Stanley was sentenced to 24 months in prison. Jason R. Coody, United States Attorney for the Northern District of Florida announced the sentences.
“The theft of any amount of taxpayer funds is inexcusable but stealing over $4.8 million dollars from honest, hardworking Americans truly in need of pandemic relief is simply abhorrent,” said U.S. Attorney Coody. “Today’s sentences both punish the defendants’ criminal conduct and should serve as a significant deterrent to others who would steal from their fellow citizens to unlawfully enrich themselves. With our law enforcement partners, we remain committed to investigating and vigorously prosecuting those who engage in acts of covid-related fraud.”
Court documents reflect that between March 1, 2020, and September 1, 2021, the Stanleys made false and fraudulent representations in applications to the Small Business Administration (SBA), financial institutions, and other lenders, for three different federal COVID-19 relief programs: Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans, Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDLs), and Shuttered Venue Operators Grants (SVOGs).  The false representations included inflated average monthly payroll expenses and the use of false tax forms as supporting documentation. The Stanleys submitted a total of 166 false and fraudulent EIDL applications, of which 50 were funded, in their names for businesses that they owned and in the names of other individuals (whom they recruited). The Stanleys also submitted 20 false and fraudulent PPP loan applications, and 3 false and fraudulent SVOG applications in their names for businesses that they owned and in the names of other individuals (whom they recruited). For most of the applications that the Stanleys submitted (which were not in their names), the Stanleys had an arrangement with the named applicants to receive a kickback from the named applicants, which was paid from the PPP, EIDL, and SVOG proceeds.
“Diverting federal funds intended to provide critical relief from the effects of a pandemic steals resources from those who need it most,” said Brian Payne IRS-CI Special Agent in Charge.  “These sentences reinforce our commitment to stopping criminals so every American taxpayer can maintain confidence in our system of taxation.”
“These sentences bring justice to the defendants who fraudulently obtained millions from Federal programs that were created to provide assistance to businesses struggling during the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Special Agent in Charge Kyle A. Myles of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC-OIG).  “The FDIC-OIG will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to hold those accountable who steal from such programs and threaten to undermine the integrity of the banking system.”
In total, through their false applications for federal COVID-19 relief funds, the Stanleys attempted to obtain over $7 million for themselves and others, to which they were not entitled.  The Stanleys were successful in fraudulently obtaining over $4.8 million in such funds.
Additionally, the Stanleys engaged in multiple monetary transactions that involved at least $10,000 of fraudulently obtained PPP loan, EIDL, or SVOG proceeds that they obtained through their scheme. Many of these transactions included payments for the purchase of real estate and to invest in virtual currency.
“These sentences demonstrate that those that steal taxpayer dollars will face the consequences for their actions,” said SBA OIG’s Eastern Region Special Agent in Charge Amaleka Brathwaite-McCall. “I want to thank the U.S. Department of Justice and our law enforcement partners for their dedication and pursuit of justice.”
The Stanleys’ imprisonment will be followed by 3 years of supervised release.  Additionally, the Stanleys were ordered to pay restitution to the SBA in the amount of $2,802,690.76, and the Court entered an order of forfeiture with respect to several parcels of real property and accounts at financial institutions.
This case was investigated by the Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigation, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation-Office of Inspector General (FDIC-OIG), Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA), and the U.S. Small Business Administration-Office of Inspector General (SBA-OIG. Assistant United States Attorney Justin M. Keen prosecuted the case.
This case was prosecuted as part the Department of Justice’s prosecution of fraud schemes that exploit the CARES Act relief programs. The CARES Act is a federal law enacted in March 2020, designed to provide emergency financial assistance to the millions of Americans suffering the economic effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. One of the two programs that were developed through CARES Act is the PPP. It provides funding to businesses through PPP loans for payroll costs, interest on mortgages, rent and utilities. PPP allows the interest and principal on loans to be forgiven if the business spends proceeds on certain expense items within a designated time and uses a certain percentage of the loan on payroll expenses. The SVOG program was established by the Economic Aid to Hard-Hit Small Businesses, Nonprofits, and Venues Act, and amended by the American Rescue Plan Act. The program included over $16 billion in grants to shuttered venues, to be administered by SBA. The SVOG program’s mission is to support the ongoing operations of eligible live venues and operators, live venue promoters, theatrical producers, talent representatives, live performing arts organization operators, museums, and motion picture theaters during the uncertain economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Department of Justice remains vigilant in detecting, investigating, and prosecuting wrongdoing related to the crisis.

California Man & Companies Charged with Defrauding Central Illinois Investors,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/california-man-companies-charged-defrauding-central-illinois,"May 3, 2023",2023,"URBANA, Ill. – A federal grand jury returned an indictment on May 2, 2023, charging Brett Michael Bartlett, 37, of the 9000 block of Grackle Ave., Fountain Valley, California, and his companies, Dynasty Toys, Inc., and 7M E-group Corporation, with wire fraud, mail fraud, securities fraud, and money laundering.
The indictment alleges that Bartlett and his California-based companies, Dynasty Toys, and 7M E-group, devised a scheme to defraud investors and obtain their money by making materially false and fraudulent pretenses, representations, and promises. According to the indictment, Bartlett, thorough Dynasty Toys and 7M E-group, purchased items at liquidation sales and resold those items online, especially through Amazon. Bartlett solicited and accepted money from Central Illinois investors, first to purchase inventory to be resold by 7M E-group at promised annual returns of 20% to 40% and later to purchase Dynasty Toys’ preferred stock shares, which Bartlett claimed were expected to double in value.
According to the indictment, Bartlett induced investors to invest by dramatically overstating the success of the companies and the returns that the companies generated for investors, lying about the companies’ assets, failing to disclose the companies’ struggles even while continuing to solicit investments, and using investors’ funds for Bartlett’s own benefit. For example, Bartlett falsely told investors their existing shares were worth approximately $30 million in total, that Dynasty Toys owned hundreds of millions of dollars of gold assets, and that another company was going to purchase Dynasty Toys for $120 million. As a result, approximately 1,000 individuals, including over 50 investors from Central Illinois, invested over $20 million with Bartlett, 7M E-group, and Dynasty Toys.
According to the indictment, in May of 2020, Bartlett mailed to Central Illinois investors checks totaling millions of dollars, but the checks bounced. The indictment alleges that investors lost approximately $22.5 million as a result of Bartlett’s and his companies’ fraud.
Bartlett, Dynasty Toys, and 7M E-group are scheduled to appear before United States Magistrate Judge Eric I. Long in Urbana, Illinois on June 1, 2023, at 2 p.m. for arraignment on the charges. A trial date will be set at that time.
If convicted, Bartlett faces a penalty of up to twenty years in prison on each fraud charge and a penalty of up to ten years in prison on the money laundering charge. Bartlett also faces a penalty of up to three years of supervised release on each charge. The charges also carry maximum fines of up to $6.25 million for Bartlett and up to $27.5 million for the corporations.
The charges are the result of an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Springfield Field Office, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation – Office of Inspector General. Supervisory Assistant U.S. Attorney Eugene L. Miller is representing the government in the prosecution.
In a parallel investigation, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed on the same date as the indictment a civil complaint against Bartlett, 7M E-group Corp., Dynasty Toys, Inc., and other defendants in the United States District Court in the Central District of California seeking a civil judgment against them.
Members of the public are reminded that an indictment is merely an accusation; the defendants are presumed innocent unless proven guilty.

Federal Jury Convicts Former St. Bernard Parish Assistant District Attorney and Two Associates for Defrauding First NBC Bank,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/federal-jury-convicts-former-st-bernard-parish-assistant,"April 26, 2023",2023,"NEW ORLEANS – U.S. Attorney Duane A. Evans announced that a federal jury has convicted GLENN E. DIAZ , age 72, of Arabi; PETER J. “PETE” JENEVEIN , age 58, of Panama City, Florida; and MARK S. GRELLE , age 69, of Chalmette, of federal bank fraud and money laundering charges related to defrauding First NBC Bank (“Bank”), the New Orleans-based bank that failed in April 2017. All three defendants are originally  from St. Bernard Parish, and DIAZ previously worked as an assistant district attorney for St. Bernard Parish for over thirty years. Between June and December 2016, the defendants defrauded First NBC Bank out of more than  $550,000.
The jury convicted DIAZ of bank fraud conspiracy, money laundering conspiracy, and eight counts of bank fraud. The jury was hung on 21 counts of bank fraud against DIAZ , for which the court declared a mistrial. JENEVEIN was convicted of bank fraud conspiracy, money laundering conspiracy, and 29 counts of bank fraud. GRELLE was convicted of conspiracy to commit bank fraud, conspiracy to commit money laundering, and 17 counts of bank fraud. GRELLE was acquitted on one count of bank fraud.
U.S. District Judge Jane Triche Milazzo presided over the six-day trial during which the government called twelve witnesses and presented over 450 exhibits. According to the evidence presented from at least April 2016 through December 20, 2016, DIAZ , JENEVEIN , and GRELLE conspired to defraud First NBC Bank through a series of false invoices and other fake documents for work purportedly done at a Florida warehouse owned by DIAZ .
DIAZ was a customer of First NBC Bank from 2006 through the bank’s closure in 2017. By late 2015, DIAZ had been overdrawing his checking account for purported business expenses. In reality, DIAZ was depositing these overdrafts into his personal account at another bank. In April 2016, First NBC Bank officers  asked DIAZ for additional information about the use of the overdrafts. In June 2016, bank officers  required that DIAZ provide  invoices as proof that he was spending bank funds to improve the Florida warehouse. DIAZ used this warehouse as collateral for his  First NBC Bank loans.  Subsequently, bank officers  rejected several of DIAZ ’s checks that did not involve  warehouse improvements.
In response to the Bank’s requirement, DIAZ had JENEVEIN and GRELLE provide fake invoices for warehouse improvements  that were purportedly performed by GRELLE ’s company, Grelle Underground Services LLC. Bank officers then approved the overdrafts based on these invoices. However, after DIAZ wrote the check to GRELLE ’s company in payment of the fake invoice, GRELLE would then write a check back to DIAZ . DIAZ would then deposit this check into his personal account at JPMorgan Chase bank, to hide it  from First NBC. DIAZ then used the money for personal expenditures unrelated to the  warehouse  including,  vintage automobiles, plastic surgery, precious metals, and online shopping. In total, DIAZ , JENEVEIN , and GRELLE executed 17 round-trip transactions through GRELLE ’s accounts. DIAZ and JENEVEIN also created other fake invoices and credit card itemizations  claiming false business expenses as well as  fabricating business names to make DIAZ ’s personal expenses appear to be  legitimate Florida construction expenses. The fake documents also included invoices from non-existent companies and  fake invoices from real companies.
As to bank fraud conspiracy and each count of bank fraud, the defendants may face  a maximum sentence of up to 30 years in prison, a maximum fine of the greater of $1,000,000 or twice the gross gain to the defendants or twice the gross loss, and up to five years of supervised release. For money laundering conspiracy, the defendants face up to 20 years in prison, a maximum fine of the greater of $500,000 or twice the value of the property involved in the transaction, and up to three years of supervised release. As to each count of conviction, the defendants face payment of a $100 mandatory special assessment fee. Judge Milazzo  scheduled sentencing in this case for July 26, 2023, at 9:30 a.m.
U.S. Attorney Evans said, “This case reaffirms our office’s commitment to prosecuting white collar criminals who act as if their wealth or power puts them above the law. Glenn Diaz’s claims of owning  tens of million dollars of assets and property throughout the United States and elsewhere in North America,  did not give him the right to lie to a bank. As co-defendants Peter Jenevein and Mark Grelle discovered after today’s jury verdict , our office  will hold anyone accountable for defrauding and conspiring to defraud a financial institution and commit money laundering through acts of deceit. I commend the First NBC trial team for its continued work prosecuting the individuals who defrauded First NBC Bank.”
“We are pleased to work with our law enforcement partners in bringing to justice those who conspire to defraud financial institutions regulated and supervised by the Federal Reserve Board,” said Stephen Donnelly, Acting Special Agent in Charge, Eastern Region, Office of Inspector General for the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
“As a former prosecutor, Mr. Diaz knew his conduct was illegal and egregious,” said FBI New Orleans Special Agent in Charge Douglas A. Williams, Jr. “Diaz and the other defendants in this case engaged in a scheme to enrich themselves. The FBI thanks its partners for their assistance in achieving justice in this case.”
This case was investigated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Office of Inspector General, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s New Orleans Field Office. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Matthew R. Payne and  Nicholas D. Moses of the Financial Crimes Unit, J. Ryan McLaren of the Appellate Unit , and Rachal Cassagne of the Violent Crime Unit are in charge of the prosecution.

Former Arkansas State Senator Sentenced for Role in Bribery Scheme
A former Arkansas state senator was sentenced yesterday to four years and two months in prison in the Western District of Missouri for accepting multiple bribes in connection with a multi-district investigation spanning the Eastern and Western Districts of Arkansas and the Western District of Missouri.
Pursuant to his global plea agreement, Jeremy Hutchinson, 48, of Little Rock, pleaded guilty on June 25, 2019, in the Eastern District of Arkansas to filing a false tax return; pleaded guilty on June 25, 2019, to an information filed in the Western District of Arkansas to conspiracy to commit federal program bribery; and pleaded guilty in the Western District of Missouri on July 8, 2019, to conspiracy to commit federal program bribery. On Feb. 3, Hutchison was sentenced to three years and 10 months in prison for his convictions in the Eastern District of Arkansas and Western District of Arkansas. His sentence in the Western District of Missouri will run consecutive to the previous sentence for a total of eight years in prison.
According to court documents in connection with his plea in the Western District of Missouri, Hutchinson was hired by then-chief operating officer Bontiea Goss as outside counsel for Preferred Family Healthcare Inc. (formerly known as Alternative Opportunities Inc.), a Springfield, Missouri-based healthcare charity. In exchange for payments and legal work, Hutchinson performed official acts on behalf of Preferred Family Healthcare, including holding up agency budgets and drafting and voting on legislation. Preferred Family Healthcare paid Hutchinson more than $350,000 in monthly retainer payments from May 2014 until 2017.
In 2022, Preferred Family Healthcare agreed to pay more than $8 million in forfeiture and restitution to the federal government and the state of Arkansas under the terms of a non-prosecution agreement, in which the company admitted to the criminal conduct of its former officers and employees.

Nevada Man Pleads Guilty in Multimillion-Dollar Fraudulent Check Scheme,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/nevada-man-pleads-guilty-multimillion-dollar-fraudulent-check,"April 21, 2023",2023,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Nevada Man Pleads Guilty in Multimillion-Dollar Fraudulent Check Scheme
A Nevada man pleaded guilty today to using fraudulent checks to steal money from victims’ bank accounts.
According to court documents, Michael Zeto, 77, of Las Vegas, partnered with foreign telemarketers, who provided Zeto with the names, bank account numbers, and other personal information for American consumers. Many of these consumers had purchased no products or services from the telemarketers and had not authorized anyone to debit their bank accounts. Zeto used the information provided by his telemarketing partners to create fraudulent checks payable to companies he controlled and debited consumers’ bank accounts. Many of Zeto’s victims were retirees and other older adults.
“The defendant was a vital link in a scheme with foreign telemarketing partners to steal money from American victims’ bank accounts,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton, head of the Justice Department’s Civil Division. “The Department of Justice is committed to protecting older Americans from fraud and to prosecuting people who knowingly help fraudsters.”
“With our increasing use and dependency on technology, fraudsters have found new ways to scam unsuspecting Americans,” said U.S. Attorney Jason M. Frierson for the District of Nevada. “Americans, and Nevadans in particular, can be assured that our office is committed to investigating and prosecuting elder financial fraud scams.”
“Today's guilty plea holds the defendant accountable for his role in a multimillion dollar fraudulent check scheme that targeted the bank accounts of American consumers,” said Acting Special Agent in Charge Justin Bundy of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General Chicago Division. “The FDIC-OIG remains dedicated to working with our law enforcement partners to pursue those who seek to defraud elderly and vulnerable Americans, and threaten the integrity of the banking system.”
“This conviction is the direct result of a diligent investigation by hardworking Postal Inspectors and our partners at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation-Office of Inspector General,” said Inspector in Charge Ruth Mendonça of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service Chicago Division. “Working together, their perseverance unraveled the defendant’s complex scheme to defraud some of our nation’s most vulnerable victims and delivered the justice that each victim deserved. We are proud of the investigative team’s efforts to uphold the mission of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS) to protect postal customers and consumers from fraudsters.”
Zeto pleaded guilty to wire fraud. He faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.
The USPIS and FDIC-OIG are investigating the case.
Trial Attorneys Daniel Zytnick and Timothy Finley of the Justice Department’s Consumer Protection Branch and Assistant U.S. Attorney Richard Anthony Lopez for the District of Nevada are prosecuting the case.
The department urges individuals to be on the lookout for unauthorized debits to their accounts. Check your bank, credit card, and other financial statements and contact your financial institution if you see a charge you do not recognize. Report any fraudulent debit you identify to law enforcement. Reports may be filed with the FTC at www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov or at 877-FTC-HELP.
If you or someone you know is age 60 or older and has experienced financial fraud, experienced professionals are standing by at the National Elder Fraud Hotline: 1-833-FRAUD-11 (1-833-372-8311). This U.S. Department of Justice hotline, managed by the Office for Victims of Crime, can provide personalized support to callers by assessing the needs of the victim and identifying relevant next steps. Case managers will identify appropriate reporting agencies, provide information to callers to assist them in reporting, connect callers directly with appropriate agencies, and provide resources and referrals, on a case-by-case basis. Reporting is the first step. Reporting can help authorities identify those who commit fraud and reporting certain financial losses due to fraud as soon as possible can increase the likelihood of recovering losses.

Monmouth County Pair Indicted for Fraudulently Obtaining More Than $3.75 Million in Loans Meant to Help Small Businesses During COVID-19 Pandemic,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/monmouth-county-pair-indicted-fraudulently-obtaining-more-375,"April 20, 2023",2023,"NEWARK, N.J. – Two former residents of Monmouth County, New Jersey, who allegedly obtained approximately $3.75 million in federal pandemic-related loans have been indicted, U.S. Attorney Philip R. Sellinger announced today.
Jean Rabbitt, 52, and Kevin Aguilar, 52, both of Sherman, Texas, and both previously of Farmingdale, New Jersey, are each charged by indictment with: one count of conspiracy to engage bank fraud; seven counts of bank fraud; one count of conspiracy to engage in wire fraud; three counts of wire fraud; conspiracy to engage in monetary transactions in property derived from specified unlawful activity and one count of engaging in monetary transactions in property derived from specified unlawful activity; and one count of aggravated identity theft. Rabbitt is additionally charged with one count of making a false statement in a loan application.
According to documents filed in this case and statements made in court:
The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act is a federal law enacted on March 29, 2020, to provide emergency financial assistance to millions of Americans suffering the economic effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. One source of relief provided by the CARES Act was the authorization of up to $349 billion in forgivable loans to small businesses for job retention and certain other expenses, through the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP).
Rabbitt and Aguilar submitted seven fraudulent PPP loan applications on behalf of four businesses that Rabbitt owned or controlled. Rabbitt and Aguilar made multiple false statements in their PPP applications, at least one of which was submitted to a Federal Home Loan Bank member. The lenders approved PPP loans totaling $3.33 million, and transmitted those funds to Rabbitt’s businesses. Rabbitt and Aguilar also submitted fraudulent applications to the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) under the federal Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) program. Based on false statements in those applications, the SBA approved EIDLs to three of Rabbitt’s businesses, totaling approximately $447,000.
After receiving the PPP and EIDL funds, Rabbitt and Aguilar transferred those funds to other businesses that Aguilar created to give the false appearance that the PPP and EIDL funds were being used for legitimate purposes. Aguilar and Rabbitt then used the PPP and EIDL funds for personal expenses.
Rabbitt and Aguilar also engaged in identity theft, by submitting an EIDL application using the name and identifying information of an individual who did not authorize the use of that information.
Rabbitt is also charged with making a false statement on a loan application, including with respect to her gross monthly income, in order to obtain financing to purchase a new truck from a Monmouth County car dealership.
U.S. Attorney Sellinger credited special agents of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation – Office of Inspector General, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Patricia Tarasca in New York; special agents of IRS – Criminal Investigation, under the direction of Acting Special Agent in Charge Tammy Tomlins; special agents of the Social Security Administration, Office of the Inspector General, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Sharon MacDermott; postal inspectors of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service in Newark, under the direction of Inspector in Charge is Christopher A.

Former Venezuelan National Treasurer and Her Husband Sentenced in Money Laundering and International Bribery Scheme,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/former-venezuelan-national-treasurer-and-her-husband-sentenced,"April 19, 2023",2023,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Former Venezuelan National Treasurer and Her Husband Sentenced in Money Laundering and International Bribery Scheme
The former National Treasurer of Venezuela and her husband were each sentenced today to 15 years in prison for their roles in a multibillion-dollar bribery and money laundering scheme.
According to court documents, Claudia Patricia Díaz Guillen, 49, and her husband, Adrian José Velásquez, 43, accepted and laundered over $136 million in bribes from co-conspirator Raúl Gorrin Belisario, a Venezuelan billionaire businessman who owned Globovision news network. Gorrin allegedly paid bribes to Díaz, including through Velásquez, to obtain access to purchase bonds from the Venezuela National Treasury at a favorable exchange rate, resulting in hundreds of millions of dollars of profit. The conspiracy involved bulk cash hidden in cardboard boxes, offshore shell companies, Swiss bank accounts, and international wire transfers allegedly sent by Gorrin for Díaz and Velásquez’s benefit, including to purchase multiple private jets and yachts, and to fund a high-end fashion line started by Díaz and Velásquez in South Florida.
“As a result of the Department of Justice’s relentless efforts, the defendants will serve lengthy prison terms for their roles in a massive bribery and money laundering scheme in which Díaz abused her role as the Venezuelan National Treasurer,” said Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Polite, Jr. of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. “As this prosecution demonstrates, the Criminal Division never wavers in its determination to hold accountable corrupt officials who subvert the rule of law and use our financial system to launder money related to their illicit schemes.”
“The sentences imposed against former Venezuelan National Treasurer Díaz and her husband send a clear message:  The United States will not tolerate its financial systems being used as personal money laundering tools by corrupt foreign officials,” said U.S. Attorney Markenzy Lapointe for the Southern District of Florida.
“The significant sentencings and judgments imposed today against Díaz and Velásquez Figueroa demonstrate that individuals who use their positions of trust to launder illicitly obtained funds through the U.S. financial systems will be held accountable,” said Acting Special Agent in Charge Michael E. Buckley of the Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Miami Field Office. “HSI Miami’s El Dorado Task Force South will continue to work with our global partners to pursue those individuals and organizations who are involved in these multibillion-dollar conspiracies and money laundering schemes.”
Díaz and Velásquez were each convicted after trial in December 2022 of money laundering offenses.  Gorrin was first charged by indictment in August 2018 and remains charged in the superseding indictment as a co-conspirator in the same money laundering scheme. He is currently a fugitive residing in Venezuela.
HSI Miami, FBI Miami, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC-OIG) investigated the case. The Justice Department’s Office of International Affairs provided significant assistance in this matter. The department appreciates the significant cooperation provided by authorities in Spain and Switzerland’s Federal Office of Justice.
Trial Attorneys Paul Hayden and Michael Culhane Harper of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Kurt Lunkenheimer and Joshua Paster for the Southern District of Florida prosecuted the case.
The Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting FCPA matters. Additional information about the Justice Department’s FCPA enforcement efforts can be found at www.justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa .
An indictment is merely an allegation. All defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.

Foreign National Involved in Religious Institution Check Theft Conspiracy Sentenced to Almost Three Years in Federal Prison
More than 3,000 Checks were Stolen from Religious Institutions
Greenbelt , Maryland – U.S. District Judge Theodore D. Chuang today sentenced Daniel Velcu, age 43, of Baltimore, Maryland, to 34 months in federal prison, followed by three years of supervised release, for conspiracy to commit bank fraud and wire fraud.  As part of his sentence, Velcu will be required to pay $1,313,499.79 in restitution.
The sentence was announced by Erek L. Barron, United States Attorney for the District of Maryland; Postal Inspector in Charge Damon E. Wood of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service - Washington Division; Special Agent in Charge James C. Harris of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Baltimore; Acting Special Agent in Charge Michael Serra of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC-OIG) Mid-Atlantic Region; Chief Marcus Jones of the Montgomery County Police Department; Chief Terry Sult of the Cary, North Carolina, Police Department; and Sheriff Dusty Rhoades of the Williamson County, Tennessee, Sheriff’s Office.
According to his guilty plea, beginning in June 2018 to October 2020, Velcu and his co-conspirators conspired to steal checks from the U.S. mail intended for religious institutions and deposit the illegally obtained funds into multiple fraudulent bank accounts at various victim financial institutions.  Conspirators, including Velcu, conducted the thefts by driving to roadside mailboxes of churches and other religious institutions and removing the mail, specifically targeting donation checks.
As part of the scheme to defraud, Velcu and other co-conspirators fraudulently opened bank accounts at victim financial institutions, often in fictitious names, with the aid of co-conspirator Diape Seck, who was an employee at one of the victim financial institutions.  Velcu used false names and accompanying fraudulent identity documents containing his photograph to open accounts and receive ATM cards and account information, in addition to using accounts opened by Seck.  Velcu and others deposited stolen checks into the fraudulently opened bank accounts and into bank accounts held in his own or a family member’s identity.  Velcu and co-conspirators then withdrew cash from the fraudulent bank accounts through ATMs and spent the illegally obtained proceeds using debit cards associated with the bank accounts.
During the course of the conspiracy, Velcu personally deposited at least 70 stolen checks, totaling at least $40,357.50 and those accounts received at least $48,987.44 from approximately 101 stolen checks.  Information found on Velcu’s cellular phone revealed that eight additional accounts in the name of Velcu or a family member received at least $82,872.65 from approximately 145 stolen checks
On October 9, 2020, law enforcement executed a search warrant at Velcu’s residence and storage unit in Baltimore and recovered approximately $87,064 is cash, assorted gold coins and jewelry, all of which are being forfeited as proceeds of the conspiracy.  Law enforcement also seized fraudulent French identity documents containing photographs of Velcu and a false name.
Five other conspirators previously pleaded guilty to the conspiracy and were sentenced to up to five years in federal prison.  Former bank employee Seck was convicted after trial.  Seck faces a maximum sentence of 30 years in federal prison for each of conspiracy to commit bank fraud; bank fraud; making false entries in bank records; and receipt of a bribe or reward by a bank employee.  U.S. District Judge Theodore D. Chuang has scheduled sentencing for Seck on June 2, 2023, at 2:30 p.m.
United States Attorney Erek L. Barron commended the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, HSI, the FDIC Office of Inspector General, the Montgomery County Police Department, the Cary (North Carolina) Police Department, and the Williamson County (Tennessee) Sheriff’s Office for their work in the investigation.  Mr. Barron thanked Assistant U.S. Attorney Elizabeth Wright, who prosecuted the case.

Former Executives of Outcome Health Convicted in $1B Corporate Fraud Scheme,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/former-executives-outcome-health-convicted-1b-corporate-fraud,"April 11, 2023",2023,"A federal jury convicted three former executives of Outcome Health, a Chicago-based health technology start-up company, for their roles in a fraud scheme that targeted the company’s clients, lenders, and investors and involved approximately $1 billion in fraudulently obtained funds.
The individuals convicted by jury verdict today were:
Outcome installed television screens and tablets in doctors’ offices around the United States and then sold advertising space on those devices to clients, most of whom were pharmaceutical companies. According to evidence presented at trial, Shah, Agarwal, and Purdy sold advertising inventory the company did not have to Outcome’s clients, then under-delivered on its advertising campaigns. Despite these under-deliveries, the company still invoiced its clients as if it had delivered in full. Shah, Agarwal, and Purdy lied or caused others to lie to conceal the under-deliveries from clients and make it appear as if the company was delivering advertising content to the number of screens in the clients’ contracts. Purdy and others at Outcome also inflated metrics that purported to show how frequently patients engaged with Outcome’s tablets installed in doctors’ offices. According to the trial evidence, the scheme targeting Outcome’s clients began in 2011, lasted until 2017, and resulted in at least $45 million of overbilled advertising services.
Shah, Agarwal, and Purdy were also convicted of defrauding Outcome’s lenders and investors. The under-delivery to Outcome’s advertising clients resulted in a material overstatement of Outcome’s revenue for the years 2015 and 2016. The company’s outside auditor signed off on the 2015 and 2016 revenue numbers because Purdy caused others to fabricate data to conceal the under-deliveries from the auditor. Shah, Agarwal, and Purdy then used the inflated revenue figures in Outcome’s 2015 and 2016 audited financial statements to raise $110 million in debt financing in April 2016, $375 million in debt financing in December 2016, and $487.5 million in equity financing in early 2017.
Shah, Agarwal, and Purdy lied to investors and lenders to conceal their ongoing under-delivery of advertising campaigns for clients. Shah and Purdy also misrepresented to investors the efficacy of Outcome’s advertising campaigns by concealing the fact that it had failed to meet return-on-investment commitments to clients.
The $110 million debt financing resulted in a $30.2 million dividend to Shah and a $7.5 million dividend to Agarwal; the $487.5 million in equity financing resulted in a $225 million dividend to Shah and Agarwal.
Three other former employees of Outcome pleaded guilty prior to trial. Ashik Desai, the former chief growth officer pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud; and Kathryn Choi, a former senior analyst, and Oliver Han, a former analyst, both pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Desai, Choi, and Han will be sentenced at a date to be determined.
Shah was convicted of five counts of mail fraud, 10 counts of wire fraud, two counts of bank fraud, and two counts of money laundering. Agarwal was convicted of five counts of mail fraud, eight counts of wire fraud, and two counts of bank fraud. Purdy was convicted on five counts of mail fraud, five counts of wire fraud, two counts of bank fraud, and one count of false statements to a financial institution. The defendants face a maximum penalty of 30 years in prison for each count of bank fraud and 20 years in prison for each count of wire fraud and mail fraud. Purdy faces a maximum penalty of 30 years in prison for the count of false statements to a financial institution. Shah faces a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison for each count of money laundering. A sentencing hearing will be scheduled at a date to be determined. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.

Assistant Chiefs William E. Johnston and Kyle C. Hankey of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Matthew F. Madden and Saurish Appleby-Bhattacharjee for the Northern District of Illinois are prosecuting the case.
“The defendants’ vast scheme damaged the clients, investors, and lenders who supported their business. Although they sought to hide the fraud by silencing whistleblowers and duping auditors, the jury today rightly held the defendants accountable for the losses they caused, which total hundreds of millions of dollars,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Pasqual. “Today’s verdicts demonstrate that this Office and its law enforcement partners will work tirelessly and dedicate the resources necessary to deliver justice for the victims of complex fraud schemes.”
“The scope of this fraud scheme is staggering, with almost $1 billion in victim losses. Today’s conviction is a fitting reminder that deceptive and illegal business practices have very real consequences"" said Special Agent-in-Charge Wheeler.
""Today's conviction holds these defendants accountable for deceiving Outcome Health's clients, and fraudulently obtaining approximately $1 billion from its lenders and investors,"" said Assistant Inspector General Richmond. ""The FDIC-OIG remains committed to working with our law enforcement partners to investigate and bring to justice those who harm lenders, investors, and clients by committing such fraudulent acts.""

Brothers Sentenced for $1.6M COVID-19 Fraud Scheme
Two men were sentenced yesterday for their participation in a COVID-19 fraud scheme, which involved fraudulent applications for $1.6 million in loans through the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP).
Dumarsais Blaise Jr., 45, of Stonecrest, Georgia, was sentenced to two years and three months in prison. His brother, Alexander Blaise, 41, of Plantation, Florida, was sentenced to two years and six months in prison.
According to court documents, Dumarsais Blaise and Alexander Blaise worked together to submit fraudulent PPP applications. Dumarsais Blaise used his expertise as a tax preparer to create fake tax documents that were submitted in support of the fraudulent applications. The conspiracy involved fabricating information about three purported companies, two of which did not exist. For the third company, the brothers falsely inflated the number of employees and payroll costs, claiming the company employed 41 people when in fact it employed only one person.
Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Polite, Jr. of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Markenzy Lapointe for the Southern District of Florida, Special Agent in Charge Kyle A.

Former Start-Up CEO Charged In $175 Million Fraud
Former CEO of Frank Charged with Making False Claims and Submitting False Data to J.P. Morgan Chase in $175 Million Acquisition Fraud Scheme
Damian Williams, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, and Patricia Tarasca, the Special Agent in Charge of the New York Regional Office of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s Office of the Inspector General (“FDIC-OIG”), announced the unsealing of a criminal Complaint charging CHARLIE JAVICE with falsely and dramatically inflating the number of customers of her company, Frank, in order to fraudulently induce J.P. Morgan Chase (“JPMC”) to acquire Frank for $175 million.  JAVICE, who appeared on the Forbes 2019 “30 Under 30” list, stood to gain over $45 million from the fraud.
JAVICE was arrested last night in New Jersey and will be presented later today before U.S. Magistrate Judge Barbara Moses.
U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said: “As alleged, Javice engaged in a brazen scheme to defraud JPMC in the course of a $175 million acquisition deal.  She lied directly to JPMC and fabricated data to support those lies — all in order to make over $45 million from the sale of her company.  This arrest should warn entrepreneurs who lie to advance their businesses that their lies will catch up to them, and this Office will hold them accountable for putting their greed above the law.”
FDIC-OIG Special Agent in Charge Patricia Tarasca said: “The allegations described in today’s criminal Complaint exemplify the many ways banks can be defrauded.  The FDIC-OIG remains committed to holding individuals accountable who threaten the integrity of financial institutions, and we thank our law enforcement partners for their diligence and dedication to investigating such crimes.”
According to the Complaint unsealed today in Manhattan federal court: [1]
In or about 2017, JAVICE founded TAPD, Inc., d/b/a Frank (“Frank”), a for-profit company that offered an online platform designed to simplify the process of filling out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (“FAFSA”).  FAFSA is a federal government form, available free of charge, that students use to apply for financial aid for college or graduate school.  JAVICE was Frank’s CEO.
In or about 2021, JAVICE began to pursue the sale of Frank to a larger financial institution.  Two major banks, one of which was JPMC, expressed interest and began acquisition processes with Frank.  JAVICE represented repeatedly to those banks that Frank had 4.25 million customers or “users.”  JAVICE explicitly defined “users” — to both banks — as individuals who had signed up for an account with Frank and for whom Frank therefore had at least four identified categories of data ( i.e. , first name, last name, email address, and phone number).  In fact, Frank had less than 300,000 users.
When JPMC sought to verify the number of Frank’s users and the amount of data collected about them — information that was critical to JPMC’s decision to move forward with the acquisition process — JAVICE fabricated a data set.  To do this, JAVICE and a co-conspirator (“CC-1”) first asked Frank’s director of engineering to create an artificially generated data set (a so-called synthetic data set).  The director of engineering raised concerns about the legality of the request, to which JAVICE responded, in substance and in part, “We don’t want to end up in orange jumpsuits.”  The director of engineering declined the request.
JAVICE then approached an outside data scientist and hired him to create the synthetic data set.  After the data set was created, JAVICE provided that synthetic data set to an agreed-upon third-party vendor in an effort to confirm to JPMC that the data set had over 4.25 million rows.  JAVICE then caused the third-party vendor to convey to JPMC that the data set had over 4.25 million rows, consistent with JAVICE’s misrepresentations that Frank had 4.25 million users.
In reliance on JAVICE’s fraudulent representations about Frank’s users, JPMC agreed to purchase Frank for $175 million.  As part of the deal, JPMC hired JAVICE and other Frank employees.  JAVICE received over $21 million for selling her equity stake in Frank and, per the terms of the deal, was to be paid another $20 million as a retention bonus.
Unbeknownst to JPMC, at or about the same time that JAVICE was creating the fabricated data set, JAVICE and CC-1 sought to purchase, on the open market, real data for over 4.25 million college students to cover up their misrepresentations.  JAVICE and CC-1 succeeded in purchasing a data set of 4.5 million students for $105,000, but it did not contain all the data fields that JAVICE had represented to JPMC were maintained by Frank.  JAVICE then purchased an additional set of data on the open market in order to augment the data set of 4.5 million users.  After JPMC acquired Frank, JPMC employees asked JAVICE and CC-1 to provide data relating to Frank’s users so that JPMC could begin a marketing campaign to those users.  In response, JAVICE provided what was supposedly Frank’s user data.  In fact, JAVICE fraudulently provided the data she and CC-1 had purchased on the open market at a small fraction of the price that JPMC paid to acquire Frank and its purported users.
*                *                *
JAVICE, 31, of Miami Beach, Florida, is charged with one count of conspiracy to commit bank and wire fraud, one count of wire fraud affecting a financial institution, and one count of bank fraud, each of which carry a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison, and one count of securities fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.

75-Year-Old South Florida Man Charged in $3 Million Check Diversion Scheme,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/75-year-old-south-florida-man-charged-3-million-check-diversion,"March 24, 2023",2023,"MIAMI – A Miami federal grand jury has charged Alan Paul Brooks, of Aventura, with mail fraud and money laundering.
According to the indictment, from June to December 2022, Brooks engaged in a scheme to steal funds payable to a health system in Louisiana. As alleged, Brooks caused a change of mail address to be filed for a U.S. post office box that received checks for the Louisiana health system. The address change diverted checks that were mailed to the post office box to the defendant’s home in Aventura.
It is also alleged that Brooks created fictitious operating names for a Florida shell company that he controlled. These fictitious operating names matched those of the Louisiana health system’s regional medical centers. Brooks also opened bank accounts in Aventura using the fictitious operating names and deposited into those accounts over $3 million in checks that were payable to the actual regional medical centers, according to the charges. After depositing the checks, Brooks moved the funds to other accounts that he controlled.

According to documents filed in the case and statements made in court:
From April 2020 through August 2020, Malanga submitted false documentation to three lenders to fraudulently obtain approximately $1.8 million in federal COVID-19 emergency relief funds meant for distressed small businesses.

GAINESVILLE, FLORIDA –Joseph Harding, 35, of Williston, Florida, plead guilty today to wire fraud, money laundering, and making false statements in connection with COVID-19 relief fraud. Jason R. Coody, United States Attorney for the Northern District of Florida, announced the guilty plea.
Court documents reflect Harding devised a scheme to defraud the Small Business Administration (SBA) and obtained coronavirus-related small business loans by means of materially false and fraudulent pretenses, representations, and promises, and while executing such scheme, caused wire communications to be transmitted in interstate commerce. Harding also made a false and fraudulent SBA Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) application, in the name of one of his dormant business entities, that he submitted to the SBA.  By this conduct, Harding fraudulently obtained $150,000 in COVID-19 relief funds from the SBA to which he was not entitled.  After obtaining the EIDL proceeds, Harding conducted three monetary transactions each involving more than $10,000 in fraudulently obtained funds: a transfer to his joint bank account, a payment to his credit card, and a transfer into a bank account of a third-party business entity.
A sentencing hearing is scheduled for July 25, 2023, at 11:00 am, at the United States Courthouse in Gainesville, Florida, before the Honorable United States District Judge Allen Winsor.
Harding faces the following maximum terms of imprisonment for the offenses:
The investigation was jointly conducted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigation, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) Office of Inspector General, and the Small Business Administration (SBA) Office of Inspector General.

U.S. Attorney Michael A. Bennett of the Western District of Kentucky, Special Agent in Charge Kathy Enstrom of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General, and Special Agent in Charge Jodi Cohen of the FBI Louisville Field Division made the announcement.
During the plea hearing, Woods admitted that between May 1, 2020, and March 31, 2021, she filed three fraudulent applications for Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans, resulting in the theft of $1,318,955. Woods utilized the entities Philips Healthcare LLC and LB Acquisitions LLC. Woods organized LB Acquisitions LLC after the onset of the Covid 19 pandemic. She then exaggerated the number of employees and payroll expenses of those entities in the fraudulent applications.
The Small Business Administration (SBA) PPP loans were designed to provide a direct incentive for small businesses who were in operation on February 15, 2020, to keep their workers on the payroll. PPP loan proceeds were required to be used by the business on certain permissible expenses. Interest and principal on PPP loans could be entirely forgiven if the business spent the loan proceeds on the allowable expenses within a designated period and used a certain percentage of the PPP loan proceeds on payroll expenses.
Woods is scheduled to be sentenced on June 22, 2023. Pursuant to the terms of the plea agreement, Woods will also forfeit certain real property and a vehicle. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.

Former Wells Fargo Executive Agrees to Plead Guilty to Obstructing Bank Examination Involving the Opening of Millions of Accounts Without Customer Authorization,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/former-wells-fargo-executive-agrees-plead-guilty-obstructing,"March 16, 2023",2023,"LOS ANGELES – The former head of Wells Fargo Bank’s retail banking division has agreed to plead guilty to obstructing a government examination into the bank’s widespread sales practices misconduct, which included opening millions of unauthorized accounts and other products, federal authorities announced today.
In a plea agreement filed today in United States District Court, Carrie L. Tolstedt, 63, of Scottsdale, Arizona, agreed to plead guilty to one count of obstruction of a bank examination. Tolstedt is expected to make her initial court appearance in Los Angeles in the coming weeks, with the parties requesting the court to set a hearing for April 7.
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), which investigated misconduct at Wells Fargo, also has reached a resolution with Tolstedt in a regulatory proceeding. As part of the consent order resolving that matter, Tolstedt agreed to a ban from working in the banking industry and to pay a $17 million civil penalty.
“The justice system and regulators rely on corporations and their executives to fully cooperate during investigations into potential wrongdoing. But, in this case, Ms. Tolstedt took steps to cover up misconduct at Wells Fargo,” said Acting United States Attorney Joseph T. McNally. “Obstructing an investigation compromises the mission of those seeking the truth, and we will hold accountable any individual who attempts to conceal wrongdoing.”
“The plea agreement filed today sends a clear message that bank executives who commit fraud and deliberately deceive regulators will be brought to justice for their actions. I commend our agents and their federal law enforcement partners for their hard work and persistence, which ultimately led to this outcome,” said Mark Bialek, Inspector General for the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
“Today’s plea agreement holds the defendant accountable for her role in obstructing the examination into the unlawful sales practices at Wells Fargo, which deceived millions of clients who placed their trust in the institution,” said Acting Inspector General Tyler Smith of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of Inspector General. “We remain committed to working with our law enforcement partners to investigate any individuals, including bank executives, who threaten to undermine the integrity of the banking sector.”
From approximately 2007 to September 2016, Tolstedt was Wells Fargo’s senior executive vice president of community banking and was head of the Community Bank, which operated Well Fargo’s consumer and small business retail banking business. The Community Bank managed many of the products that Wells Fargo sold to individual customers and small businesses, including checking and savings accounts, CDs, debit cards, bill pay, and other products.
Wells Fargo previously admitted that, from 2002 to 2016, excessive sales goals led Community Bank employees to open millions of accounts and other financial products that were unauthorized or fraudulent. In the process, Wells Fargo collected millions of dollars in fees and interest to which it was not entitled, harmed customers’ credit ratings, and unlawfully misused customers’ sensitive personal information.
Many of these practices were referred to within Wells Fargo as “gaming.” Gaming strategies included using existing customers’ identities – without their consent – to open accounts. Gaming practices included forging customer signatures to open accounts without authorization, creating PINs to activate unauthorized debit cards, and moving money from millions of customer accounts to unauthorized accounts in a practice known internally as “simulated funding.”
Gaming also included opening credit cards and bill pay products without authorization, altering customers’ contact information to prevent customers from learning of unauthorized accounts and to prevent Wells Fargo employees from reaching customers to conduct customer satisfaction surveys, and encouraging customers to open accounts they neither wanted nor needed.
According to the plea agreement filed today, by no later than 2004, Tolstedt was aware of sales practices misconduct within the Community Bank and the fact that employees were terminated each year for gaming. By no later than 2006, Tolstedt was learning about the gaming practices from corporate investigations and, over time, learned that terminations for gaming in the Community Bank were steadily increasing, that the misconduct was linked in part to sales goals within the Community Bank, and that termination numbers likely underestimated the scope of the problem.
Although the Community Bank eventually took steps purportedly designed to proactively identify sales misconduct, the measures used by the bank flagged only a small portion of the potentially problematic activity for investigation. As of July 2014, only the most egregious .01 to .05 percent of employees engaging in activity considered a “red flag” for sales practices misconduct were investigated – with the remaining 99.95 to 99.99 percent left unexamined under this process.
In May 2015, Tolstedt participated in the preparation of a memorandum, which she knew would be provided to the OCC in connection with its examination of sales practice issues at Wells Fargo. To minimize the scope of the sales practices misconduct within the Community Bank, Tolstedt corruptly obstructed the OCC’s examination by failing to disclose statistics on the number of employees who were terminated or resigned pending investigation for sales practices misconduct. She also failed to disclose that the Community Bank proactively investigated only a very small percentage of employees who engaged in activity flagged as potential sales practices misconduct.
“We are proud to work with our partner agencies to help bring justice to the many people who were harmed by the unscrupulous sales practices of Wells Fargo,” said Brian Tomney, Inspector General of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. “The results of this case should be a clear signal that FHFA-OIG and its partner agencies will hold accountable those who seek to put profits ahead of legal and fair banking practices.”
“This plea agreement demonstrates the determination and cooperation of Postal Inspectors and our federal law enforcement partners. Postal Inspectors are committed to investigating anyone holding a position of trust in the financial system that would engage in a fraud to deceive their customers,” said Rafael Nuñez, Inspector in Charge of the United States Postal Inspection Service, San Francisco Division.
Wells Fargo in 2020 acknowledged the widespread sales practices misconduct within the Community Bank and paid a $3 billion penalty in connection with agreements reached with the United States Attorneys’ Offices for the Central District of California and the Western District of North Carolina, the Justice Department’s Civil Division, and the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The statutory maximum sentence for obstruction of a bank examination is five years in federal prison. Tolstedt has entered into a plea agreement which calls for a prison sentence of up to 16 months in prison, which prosecutors believe is the high end of the sentencing guideline range for the obstruction offense. The plea agreement is “binding,” which means the court must accept or reject all aspects of it. Should the court reject the plea agreement, including the agreed-upon sentencing range, any party may withdraw from it.
The FBI; the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of Inspector General; the Federal Housing Finance Agency, Office of Inspector General; the Office of Inspector General for the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau; and the United States Postal Inspection Service are investigating this matter. The OCC and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission provided substantial assistance.
This matter is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys Alexander B. Schwab and Carolyn S. Small of the Major Frauds Section, along with Special Attorney Benjamin S. Kingsley and Assistant United States Attorney Daniel S. Ryan of the Western District of North Carolina.

"Sterling Bancorp, Inc. to Plead Guilty to $69M Securities Fraud",https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/sterling-bancorp-inc-plead-guilty-69m-securities-fraud,"March 15, 2023",2023,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Sterling Bancorp, Inc. to Plead Guilty to $69M Securities Fraud
A Southfield, Michigan-headquartered bank holding company has agreed to plead guilty to securities fraud for filing false securities statements relating to its 2017 initial public offering (IPO) and its 2018 and 2019 annual filings.
According to a signed plea agreement that will be publicly filed in court, Sterling Bancorp, Inc. (the Company) was the holding company for its wholly owned subsidiary, Sterling Bank and Trust F.S.B. (the Bank, or together with the Company, “Sterling”). Sterling – with branches located in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Seattle, New York, and Southfield – completed an IPO in 2017, and the Company’s stock began trading on the NASDAQ exchange under the ticker symbol “SBT.”
“For years, Sterling originated residential mortgages that were rife with fraud to pad its bottom line and then lied about these loans in its IPO and subsequent public filings, defrauding unwitting investors,” said Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Polite, Jr. of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. “This proposed guilty plea reflects the nature and seriousness of the wrongdoing and demonstrates the Department of Justice’s commitment to protecting the integrity of our public markets, holding corporations accountable for their criminal misconduct, and compensating victims for their losses.”
The largest portion of the Bank’s loan portfolio was composed of residential mortgage loans. In or around 2011, the Bank established a residential mortgage loan program known as the Advantage Loan Program (ALP). Between 2011 and 2019, the Bank’s employees and agents originated at least $5 billion in ALP loans. The Bank touted the ALP’s flexible documentation requirements and fast underwriting and closing capabilities. The program required a minimum 35% down payment and charged higher rates and fees than generally were available elsewhere in the market, but it did not require submission of typical loan documentation, such as an applicant’s tax returns or payroll records.
“The consequences of this type of financial fraud scheme are damaging and far-reaching,” said Assistant Director Luis Quesada of the FBI’s Criminal Investigative Division. “The FBI and our law enforcement partners remain committed to protecting good-faith investors and safeguarding the integrity of our markets from companies that commit securities fraud.”
In the lead-up to its IPO, Sterling, through its founder and certain members of senior management, encouraged loan officers to increase the volume of ALP loan originations to increase the Bank’s revenue through origination fees and interest payments. The Bank’s Underwriting Department maintained internal underwriting guidelines that governed the loan approval process for the ALP. The underwriting guidelines required loan officers to obtain various documents from the borrower and the borrower’s employer. In addition to collecting these documents, loan officers were supposed to calculate the borrower’s debt-to-income ratio, which was a personal-finance measure that compared the amount of debt a borrower had to the borrower’s overall income and was used to measure the borrower’s ability to manage monthly mortgage payments. Taken together, the various documents obtained from the borrower and the borrower’s employer, and related information, were critical to completing certain mortgage application forms and assessing the creditworthiness of a borrower’s application.
In connection with loans originated through the ALP, and with the knowledge and encouragement of Sterling’s founder and certain members of senior management, the Bank’s loan officers falsified, caused to be falsified, and concealed various information from the Bank’s Underwriting Department and Quality Control Department that the loan officers believed would delay or prevent the Bank from originating loans under the ALP.
The false information that the loan officers included and caused to be included in ALP applications was ultimately transmitted to, and relied upon by, the Bank’s Underwriting Department and caused the Bank to originate ALP loans and extend credit to borrowers who otherwise would not have qualified for credit from the Bank based upon the underwriting guidelines. These fraudulent loans directly increased the Bank’s revenue through fees and interest associated with the origination of the fraudulent loans.
In or around October 2017 – while Sterling was artificially inflating its revenue through the ALP – Sterling went public. In connection with its IPO, Sterling’s 2017 SEC Form S-1 contained materially false and misleading statements that touted the soundness of the ALP loans. In truth, the ALP was rife with fraud.
After Sterling’s IPO, the ALP fraud continued. In its 2018 and 2019 SEC Form 10-K filings, Sterling reiterated a series of materially false and misleading statements about the ALP. As a result of Sterling’s fraud, the total loss to Sterling’s non-insider victim-shareholders was nearly $70 million.
“Bank holding companies that engage in fraud to deceive the public and regulators must be brought to justice for their actions,” said Inspector General Mark Bialek of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. “I commend our agents and their federal law enforcement partners for their hard work and persistence, which ultimately led to today’s announcement.”
“This proposed guilty plea holds Sterling accountable for its role in defrauding non-insider victim-shareholders of millions of dollars by originating fraudulent loans through its Advantage Loan Program and filing false securities statements about the Program in its IPO and subsequent annual filings,” said Acting Inspector General Tyler Smith of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC-OIG). “The FDIC-OIG is committed to working with our law enforcement partners to investigate financial crimes that harm innocent investors and consumers and undermine the integrity of the banking sector.”
“This case is another example of Postal Inspectors relentlessly pursuing any individual or entity committing securities fraud,” said Inspector in Charge Eric Shen of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS) Criminal Investigations. “I'm proud of the work done by all the investigators involved in this case and look forward to the continued collaborative efforts between Postal Inspectors and our law enforcement partners.”
Under the terms of the plea agreement, which must be accepted by the court, the Company will plead guilty to one count of securities fraud. The Company will also be required to serve a term of probation through 2026, submit to enhanced reporting obligations to the department, and pay more than $27.2 million in restitution to its non-insider victim-shareholders. The department considered a range of factors outlined in the department’s Inability to Pay Guidance and determined that any payment exceeding approximately $27.2 million is reasonably likely to threaten the continued viability of the Company, which may expose the Company’s shareholders to a further risk of loss. Accordingly, to ensure that the maximum amount of the Company’s funds is paid to restitution, the department has agreed not to seek a criminal fine in this case.
A number of relevant considerations contributed to the department’s criminal resolution with Sterling, including the nature and seriousness of the offense and the pervasiveness of the misconduct at the most senior levels of the Company. Sterling received credit for its cooperation with the department’s investigation and engaged in extensive remedial measures, including terminating employees involved in the ALP fraud, such that through terminations and resignations, more than 100 officers and employees left the bank; completely overhauling the Bank’s senior management, including terminations of former senior management; overhauling the Bank’s residential lending department, internal audit function, compliance function, and Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering function, and creating an enterprise risk management function; permanently ending the ALP; hiring a new chairman, chief executive officer, and president; increasing the number of independent directors on the Company’s board of directors; and implementing a new business model to reduce its risk profile.
As part of Sterling’s plea agreement, Sterling agreed to cooperate fully with the United States in all matters relating to the conduct covered by the plea agreement and other conduct under investigation by the United States, to self-report violations of U.S. federal criminal law, and to continue to implement a compliance and ethics program designed to effectively detect and deter violations of U.S. securities laws throughout its operations.
The FBI Los Angeles Field Office, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Office of Inspector General, FDIC-OIG San Francisco, and USPIS investigated the case.
Assistant Chief Cory E. Jacobs and Trial Attorney Amanda Fretto Lingwood of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section are prosecuting the case.

These loans are guaranteed by the Small Business Administration under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act.
Hernandez conspired with Erich Alfonso Barata, Armando De Leon, and others to submit over 90 fraudulent PPP loan applications. The applications were primarily submitted to two banks, Hernandez’s employer at the time, and his previous employer, another leading national bank.
Hernandez also conspired to submit fraudulent Economic Injury Disaster Loan applications through the SBA, but most of the applications were declined.
Hernandez and his co-conspirators attempted to defraud the PPP and EIDL programs out of approximately $25 million. The conspiracy caused approximately $15 million in losses.  The investigation has recovered over $800,000 so far.
Daniel Hernandez pled guilty on December 21, 2022, to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. De Leon and Alfonso Barata previously pled guilty for their roles in the conspiracy. De Leon was sentenced to 60 months’ imprisonment on February 21.  Alfonso Barata is scheduled to be sentenced on April 18.

In March 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act was enacted. It was designed to provide emergency financial assistance to the millions of Americans suffering the economic effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Among other sources of relief, the CARES Act authorized and provided funding to the SBA to provide Economic Injury Disaster Loans (“EIDLs”) to eligible small businesses, including sole proprietorships and independent contractors, experiencing substantial financial disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic to allow them to meet financial obligations and operating expenses that could otherwise have been met had the disaster not occurred.  EIDL applications were submitted directly to the SBA via the SBA’s on-line application website, and the applications were processed and the loans funded for qualifying applicants directly by the SBA.

"Illinois Attorney Found Guilty of Embezzlement, Bankruptcy Fraud, and Tax Fraud",https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/illinois-attorney-found-guilty-embezzlement-bankruptcy-fraud-and,"March 13, 2023",2023,"Illinois Attorney Found Guilty of Embezzlement, Bankruptcy Fraud, and Tax Fraud
Monday, March 13, 2023
CHICAGO — A federal jury has found a former Illinois attorney and real estate developer guilty on two counts of embezzlement, six counts of bankruptcy fraud, and eight counts of tax fraud following a nearly four week-long trial in Chicago.
Evidence at trial revealed that ROBERT KOWALSKI, 61, of Chicago was a close associate of John Gembara, the former President of Washington Federal Bank for Savings (“WFBS”), a small bank in Chicago’s Bridgeport neighborhood which was closed in December 2017 after the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency determined that the bank was insolvent and had at least $66 million in nonperforming loans.  Kowalski served a key role in the embezzlement scheme, specifically diverting from the bank more than $8 million, plus property which was rightly the collateral of the bank for other loans.  The embezzled funds that Kowalski received from WFBS were concealed by entering them on the bank’s records as loan disbursements.  However, WFBS never required Kowalski to repay these fraudulent loans.  Along with his co-conspirators, Kowalski was involved in the falsification of bank records and the recording of false financial transactions to shift real estate interests into his own name for financial benefit.  After the collapse of WFBS, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation attempted to collect on the money and properties that Kowalski obtained as part of the embezzlement scheme.  To avoid losing the assets, Kowalski filed a fraudulent bankruptcy case, in which he attempted to concealed numerous assets.  To substantiate the financial claims made within his bankruptcy filings, and avoid paying taxes, Kowalski filed false corporate returns in 2014 and 2015, and false personal returns in 2015, 2016, and 2017.  Kowalski failed to file returns in 2013 and 2014.
Sentencing has been set for June 2, 2023 before U.S. District Court Judge Virginia M. Kendall.  Kowalski could face a sentence of up to 82 years in federal prison.
The verdict was announced by Morris Pasqual, Acting United States Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois; Kathy A. Enstrom, Special Agent in Charge of the Chicago Region of the FDIC’s Office of Inspector General; Machelle L. Jindra, Special Agent in Charge of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's Office of Inspector General in Chicago; Justin Campbell, Special Agent-in-Charge of IRS Criminal Investigation in Chicago; Catherine Huber, Special Agent-in-Charge of the Central Region of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, Office of Inspector General; Robert W. Wheeler, Jr., Special Agent-in-Charge of the Chicago Field Office of the FBI; Andrea Peacock, Special Agent in Charge of the of the Department of the Treasury, Office of Inspector General; Deborah Witzburg, City of Chicago Inspector General; and Kathryn Richards, Chicago Housing Authority Inspector General.  Valuable assistance was provided by the U.S. Trustee Program.  The government was represented by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Jeremy Daniel, Kristin Pinkston, and Brian Netols, along with Special Assistant U.S. Attorney Jeffrey Snell.

Ashburn Woman Convicted of $2.5 Million Pandemic Fraud,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/ashburn-woman-convicted-25-million-pandemic-fraud,"March 6, 2023",2023,"ALEXANDRIA, Va. – A federal jury convicted an Ashburn woman today on charges of conspiracy, bank fraud, and money laundering.
According to court records and evidence presented at trial, Rose-Marie Nsahlai, 47, and her husband fraudulently obtained two Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans. The PPP was a program instituted by the U.S. Congress to help businesses affected by the coronavirus pandemic continue to pay salaries or wages to their employees. Nsahlai carried out the scheme in connection with two of her husband’s businesses by creating fraudulent payroll documentation for each business, and then submitting that documentation in support of the PPP loan applications. The fraudulent documentation represented that her husband’s businesses had dozens of employees with over $17 million of annual payroll in 2019, when in fact they had few, if any, employees.
In total, Nsahlai and her husband fraudulently obtained approximately $2,501,753 in loan proceeds, and they then spent those funds on items unrelated to any legitimate PPP-related expense. Those items included the down-payment on a 7,000-square-foot home in Leesburg. Nsahlai’s husband pleaded guilty to this scheme in 2021.
Nsahlai faces a maximum penalty of 30 years in prison when sentenced on July 19. Actual sentences for federal crimes are typically less than the maximum penalties. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after taking into account the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.

Former Bank Employee Convicted After Trial for Fraudulently Opening Bank Accounts
Greenbelt, Maryland – A federal jury in Maryland has convicted Diape Seck, age 29, of Rockville, Maryland for his role in a bank fraud scheme in which he and his co-conspirators obtained or attempted to obtain almost $2 million by fraud, including by stealing checks from the mail of churches and religious institutions.  The guilty verdict was returned late on February 24, 2023.
The guilty verdict was announced by Erek L. Barron, United States Attorney for the District of Maryland; Postal Inspector in Charge Damon E. Wood of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service - Washington Division; Special Agent in Charge James C. Harris of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Baltimore; Acting Special Agent in Charge Mike Serra of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of Inspector General (FDIC-OIG); Chief Marcus Jones of the Montgomery County Police Department; Chief Terry Sult of the Cary, North Carolina, Police Department; and Sheriff Dusty Rhoades of the Williamson County, Tennessee, Sheriff’s Office.
According to the evidence presented at his eight-day trial, from at least January 2019 to January 2020, Seck, a customer service representative with Bank A, conspired with Mateus Vaduva, Marius Vaduva, Vlad Baceanu, Nicolae Gindac, Florin Vaduva, Marian Unguru, Daniel Velcu, Vali Unguru and others to commit bank fraud.  Specifically, the evidence showed that Seck fraudulently opened bank accounts in fake identities in exchange for cash bribes.  Co-conspirators engaged in fraud that included fraud involving rental cars and the deposit of checks stolen from the incoming and outgoing mail of churches and other religious institutions, into the fraudulently opened bank accounts.  The co-conspirators then withdrew the funds and spent the fraudulently obtained proceeds.
As detailed in the trial evidence, Diape Seck facilitated the opening of hundreds of bank accounts at Bank A for his co-conspirators, who used purported foreign identity documents, often but not universally Romanian, to fraudulently open bank accounts with him at Bank A, as well as bank accounts at other victim financial institutions.  Seck opened accounts for co-conspirators without their presence in the bank, without verifying identity information, and opened accounts for co-conspirators who opened multiple accounts at a time under different identities.  To conceal his improper activities, Seck opened accounts for the co-conspirators at the same time he conducted legitimate bank activities.  The co-conspirators paid Seck cash in exchange for him opening the fraudulent bank accounts.
According to court documents and witness testimony, Seck violated numerous bank policies in opening approximately 412 checking accounts in a one-year period from approximately January 2, 2019 through January 3, 2020, relying predominantly on purported Romanian passports and driver's license information.  Checks payable to and written from churches and other religious institutions from around the country were deposited into many of the 412 checking accounts which were not opened in the names of the churches.
The co-conspirators fraudulently negotiated the stolen checks by depositing them into the victim bank accounts, including the fraudulent accounts opened by Seck at Bank A, often by way of automated teller machine (ATM) transactions.   After depositing the stolen checks into the bank accounts, the conspirators made cash withdrawals from ATMs and purchases using debit cards associated with the bank accounts.
Co-conspirators Vlad Baceanu, age 38; Daniel Velcu, age 43; Marian Unguru, age 36; and Vali Unguru, age 20, all of Baltimore, Maryland, previously pled guilty to conspiracy to commit bank fraud and wire fraud.  Nicolae Gindac, age 52, of Dania Beach, Florida was sentenced to 54 months in federal prison and ordered to pay restitution of $1,096,660.11; Mateus Vaduva, age 29, of Baltimore was sentenced to five years in federal prison and ordered to pay restitution of $1,320,885.84; Florin Vaduva, age 31, of Dania Beach, Florida was sentenced to 51 months in federal prison and ordered to pay restitution of $1,096,660.11; and Marius Vaduva, age 28, of Baltimore was sentenced to 42 months in federal prison and ordered to pay restitution of $1,334,230.84, after they previously pled guilty to conspiracy to commit bank and wire fraud.
Seck faces a maximum sentence of 30 years in federal prison for each of conspiracy to commit bank fraud; bank fraud; making false entries in bank records; and receipt of a bribe or reward by a bank employee.  U.S. District Judge Theodore D. Chuang has scheduled sentencing for Seck on June 2, 2023, at 2:30 p.m.
United States Attorney Erek L. Barron commended the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, HSI, the FDIC Office of Inspector General, the Montgomery County Police Department, the Cary (North Carolina) Police Department, and the Williamson County (Tennessee) Sheriff’s Office for their work in the investigation.  Mr. Barron thanked Assistant U.S. Attorneys Elizabeth Wright and Darren Gardner, who are prosecuting the case.

Two Individuals Sentenced for Multimillion-Dollar Cattle-Trading Ponzi Scheme
Two individuals were sentenced today to six years in prison for their roles in a cattle-trading Ponzi scheme that resulted in millions of dollars in victim losses.
According to court documents, from late 2017 until early 2019, Reva Joyce Stachniw, 71, of Galesburg, Illinois, and Ron Throgmartin, 59, of Buford, Georgia, along with a co-conspirator, ran a Ponzi scheme by fraudulently representing to victims that their investments were backed by short-term investments in Stachniw and Throgmartin’s cattle and marijuana businesses. The victim-investors gave the conspirators money based on false promises that their investments would be used for legitimate activities related to those businesses. In actuality, the funds were used to pay earlier investors.
In August 2022, Stachniw and Throgmartin were convicted at trial of one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, five counts of wire fraud, and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering.
In addition to their terms of imprisonment, Stachniw was ordered to pay $14,597,335.80 in restitution and to forfeit $6,013,370. Throgmartin was ordered to pay $14,597,335.80 in restitution and to forfeit $1,004,904.83. The restitution was ordered jointly and severally between the two.

Prince George’s County Man Pleads Guilty To A Federal Wire Fraud Conspiracy To Obtain Over $1 Million In Covid-19 Cares Act Loans And Unemployment Insurance Benefits
A Search At The Defendant’s Residence Also Recovered Four “Ghost Guns,” Including One that Was Modified to be a Machinegun
Greenbelt , Maryland – Jerry Phillips, a/k/a “Tian Juzo,” age 25, of Capitol Heights, Maryland, pleaded guilty today to a federal wire fraud conspiracy, aggravated identity theft, and illegal possession of a machine gun, related to a scheme to fraudulently obtain more than $1 million in COVID-19 CARES Act Paycheck Protection Program loan applications (PPP), Economic Injury Disaster loan applications (EIDL), and unemployment insurance claims.
The guilty plea was announced by Erek L. Barron, United States Attorney for the District of Maryland; Acting Special Agent in Charge Troy W. Springer, of the National Captial Region, U.S. Department of Labor - Office of Inspector General (DOL-OIG); Special Agent in Charge Kareem A. Carter of the Internal Revenue Service - Criminal Investigation, Washington, D.C. Field Office; Special Agent in Charge Amaleka McCall-Brathwaite of the Small Business Administration - Office of Inspector General, Eastern Region, and Acting Special Agent in Charge Mike Serra, of the Mid-Atlantic Region, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC-OIG).
“Fraudsters like Jerry Phillips often commit other crimes, as demonstrated by his illegal possession of a ghost gun, which he modified to be a machine gun,” said United States Attorney Erek L. Barron.  “We will continue to use every legal means necessary to remove illegal guns from our communities and to hold criminals accountable.”
“Jerry Phillips conspired with his brother to defraud the UI, PPP, and EIDL pandemic relief programs of more than $750,000 in funds intended to assist those who were truly in need from the financial impact brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Troy W. Springer, Acting Special Agent in Charge of the National Capital Region, U.S. Department of Labor – Office of Inspector General. “My office will continue to work closely with the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Maryland and our other law enforcement partners to pursue those who unwisely chose to commit pandemic-related UI fraud and hold them accountable for their criminal conduct.”
“During this pandemic, we have all too often seen people take advantage of programs meant to help those in need, stealing money away from those in crisis,” said Kareem A. Carter, Special Agent in Charge of the IRS-CI Washington D.C. Field Office.  “We will continue in our partnership with fellow federal agencies to investigate individuals who illegally use pandemic relief funds for personal financial gain.”
“Conspiring to fraudulently gain access to SBA program funds by falsifying personal identifying information is reprehensible,” said SBA OIG’s Eastern Region Special Agent in Charge Amaleka McCall-Brathwaite. “OIG and its law enforcement partners will relentlessly pursue fraudsters and bring them to justice. I want to thank the U.S. Attorney’s Office and our law enforcement partners for their dedication and commitment to seeing justice served.”
According to his plea agreement, from March 2020 to February 2022, Phillips worked with his brother and co-defendant, Jaleel Phillips, and at least one other person. to fraudulently obtain COVID-19 related benefits, including filing fraudulent PPP loan applications, EIDL loan applications, and unemployment insurance claims.  As detailed in the statement of facts, Phillips and his co-conspirators created fictitious aliases, used the personal identifying information of real people, and used defunct corporate entities or new business entities with no actual business operations to apply for EIDL and PPP loans, and unemployment benefits.
As part of the scheme, Phillips admitted that he created and used multiple fake identities to submit fraudulent PPP and EIDL loan applications and used the personal identifying information of more than 20 real people in furtherance of fraudulent unemployment claims.  The fraudulently obtained PPP and EIDL loans and unemployment insurance claims were deposited into the bank accounts opened in the names of the aliases.  The money was then withdrawn by Phillips and his co-conspirators through ATM withdrawals and purchases made on the associated debit and credit cards or transferred between the various financial accounts established in the aliases’ names.  Phillips used $65,538.95 of the fraudulently obtained funds to purchase a 2020 Chevrolet Camaro, which he registered in his name at the Maryland Motor Vehicle Administration.  Jerry Phillips also admitted that he personally obtained and controlled more than $1 million in fraud proceeds from the fraudulent PPPs and EIDLs.
A search of the defendant’s residence recovered more than 25 fake driver’s licenses from multiple states and multiple identification documents from different jurisdictions with the same alias.  Law enforcement also recovered four “ghost guns” which Jerry Phillips purchased online, using an alias.  Phillips admitted that he illegally modified one of the ghost guns into a machine gun capable of firing multiple rounds with one pull of the trigger.
Jaleel Phillips, age 25, of Capitol Heights, Maryland, previously pleaded guilty to his role in the wire fraud conspiracy and faces a maximum sentence of 30 years in federal prison.  U.S. District Judge Theodore D. Chuang has scheduled sentencing for April 14, 2023, at 9:30 a.m.
Jerry Phillips faces a maximum sentence of 30 years in federal prison for the wire fraud conspiracy; a mandatory sentence of two years in federal prison, consecutive to any other sentencing imposed, for aggravated identity theft; and a maximum of 10 years in federal prison for illegal possession of a machine gun.  Judge Chuang has scheduled sentencing for Jerry Phillips on May 16, 2023, at 2 p.m.

Former Beulah Bank President Sentenced to Two Counts of Bank Fraud
BISMARCK – United States Attorney Mac Schneider announced that on February 15, 2023, U.S. District Court Judge Daniel M. Traynor sentenced Brady Daniel Torgerson, age 35, from Beulah, North Dakota, to serve 24 months in federal prison, three years of supervised release, and $200.00 special assessment. On November 4, 2022, law enforcement arrested Torgerson for these offenses and, on August 12, 2022, Torgerson pleaded guilty to two separate counts of bank fraud against financial institutions located in Beulah, North Dakota, namely, First Security Bank-West and the Union Bank.
Between 2019 and 2021, while employed at separate times as the President of First Security Bank-West and as a loan officer at the Union Bank, Torgerson conducted banking transactions, which caused harm to both these banks and the banks’ individual customers. Specifically, while employed at First Security Bank-West, Torgerson funded loans without obtaining: 1) necessary financial information; 2) security interest documents; or 3) promissory notes. Additionally, Torgerson engaged in deceptive banking transactions by entering false information into the bank’s computer system, increasing loans so that they exceeded the original loan amounts, and extending loan maturity dates to conceal his activities. Most notably, while employed at the Union Bank, Torgerson created fraudulent loan obligations in the amounts of $225,487.44 and $225,487.45 in the names of three separate individuals who neither knew about the creation of these loans nor received the funds described in these obligations.
“Bank fraud is a serious crime that harms the honest financial institutions we have in North Dakota,” US Attorney Mac Schneider said. “This sentence is a credit to the skillful efforts of our career prosecutors and partners in law enforcement. It is also a reminder that there is a high price to pay for white-collar crime.”
“The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation-Office of Inspector General (FDIC-OIG) continues to investigate allegations of fraud by bank executives and others in order to preserve the integrity of the banking system,” said Justin Bundy, Special Agent in Charge of the FDIC-OIG Kansas City Regional Office. “We are proud to have joined the United States Attorney’s Office for the District of North Dakota, as well as our law enforcement partners in conducting this investigation.”
“We are committed to investigating allegations of fraud committed against the Federal Home Loan Banks or their members, especially in cases where we find flagrant criminal conduct by officials at member banks,” said Catherine Huber, Special Agent in Charge of the Federal Housing Finance Agency-Office of Inspector General’s (FHFA-OIG) Central Region Office. “Thank you to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of North Dakota and our federal partners for helping us bring swift justice in this case.”
Co-Defendants for this investigation received the following sentences:
This case was investigated by the FDIC-OIG, the FHFA-OIG, and the Federal Reserve Board-Office of Inspector General and prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Jonathan J. O’Konek.

Reeves, after pleading guilty to bank fraud.
According to Custer’s plea agreement, he admitted to lying to Traditional Bank to obtain two loans, totaling more than $1.5 million, for the purchase of a home and property to be used for an equine business.  He also admitted to lying to victim P.H., to obtain a $75,000 personal loan.  Custer conceded that he provided the bank and P.H. with false personal financial statements, supported by falsely manipulated documentation from well-known financial institutions, suggesting he was worth more $6 million.  Actual records from these financial institutions showed at most a $100.00 closing balance in one account.  He also exaggerated the value of his personal assets, claiming to own roughly $300,000 in household goods and furniture, when seeking loans from Traditional Bank and P.H.; but he then admitted he owned roughly $20,000 worth of these same items in his bankruptcy filing.
After repaying P.H. and the foreclosure on the property he bought with the proceeds of the Traditional Bank loans, Custer still owes more than $500,000 in restitution.
Custer pleaded guilty on October 21, 2022.
Under federal law, Custer must serve 85 percent of his prison sentence, upon his/her/their release from prison will be under the supervision of the U.S. Probation Office for five years.

Simi Valley Man Sentenced to Over 4 Years in Prison for Fraudulently Obtaining More Than $1 Million in COVID Business Loans,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/simi-valley-man-sentenced-over-4-years-prison-fraudulently,"February 13, 2023",2023,"LOS ANGELES – A Ventura County man who schemed with an Orange County man to illegally acquire disaster relief funds was sentenced today to 51 months in federal prison for fraudulently obtaining more than $1 million in loans intended to help businesses weather the COVID-19 pandemic’s economic fallout.
Manuel Asadurian, 66, of Simi Valley, was sentenced by United States District Judge Dale S. Fischer, who also ordered him to pay $1,071,222 in restitution.
Asadurian pleaded guilty in October 2022 to one count of wire fraud affecting a financial institution.
From April 2020 to January 2021, Asadurian and an accomplice, Jeffrey Scott Hedges, 51, of Irvine, schemed to fraudulently obtain federal disaster relief funds distributed through the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) and Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) programs that Congress intended to help businesses during the pandemic.
Asadurian lied to the United States Small Business Administration and federally insured financial institutions on a total of 12 PPP and EIDL loan applications, which were submitted on behalf of Asadurian-controlled businesses, including LTL Enterprises LLC, Redline Performance LLC, and Diamond A Motorsports. Hedges submitted 18 fraudulent PPP and EIDL applications on behalf of companies he controlled, including West Coast Chassis, WCC Pro Touring, Von Schoff Apparel, and Hedges Corvette.
The false information submitted by Asadurian and Hedges included the number of employees to whom the companies had paid wages, the amount of payroll expenses for the companies, and false certifications that the loans would be used for permissible business purposes. In support of the bogus applications, Asadurian and Hedges submitted false tax documents, payroll records and bank records that fraudulently inflated the number of employees and amount of payroll expenses and gross receipts associated with the companies.
Once the PPP and EIDL loan applications were approved, they were deposited in bank accounts Asadurian and Hedges controlled. Asadurian and Hedges then used the fraudulently obtained loans for their personal benefit, including making mortgage payments on a personal residence, paying living expenses and medical expenses, and purchasing luxury vehicles.
In total, Asadurian sought approximately $1,620,122 in PPP and EIDL loans and fraudulently obtained approximately $1,071,222 related to those loans.
In a related case, Hedges pleaded guilty in August 2022 to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud affecting a financial institution and one count of aggravated identity theft for his submission of fraudulent PPP and EIDL applications that sought approximately $5,288,476. Hedges received approximately $2,087,701 of those loan funds. On January 30, Judge Fischer sentenced Hedges to a term of seven years in federal prison and ordered him to pay $2,087,701 in restitution.
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General; the Federal Reserve Board Office of Inspector General; the FBI; IRS Criminal Investigation; Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration; and the Small Business Administration investigated these matters.
Assistant United States Attorney Scott Paetty of the Major Frauds Section prosecuted these cases.

According to court documents and evidence presented at trial, from 2006 through April 2017, RYAN and others conspired to defraud First NBC Bank (the “Bank”) through a variety of schemes. RYAN was the President and CEO of the Bank for most of its existence. RYAN and others, conspired to defraud First NBC Bank by disguising the true financial status of certain borrowers and their troubled loans, concealing the true financial condition of the Bank from the Board of Directors (the “Board”), auditors, and examiners.
When members of the Board or the Bank’s outside auditors or examiners asked about loans to these borrowers, RYAN and others made false statements about the borrowers and their loans, omitting the truth about the borrowers’ inability to pay their debts without getting new loans. As a result, the balance on these borrowers’ loans continued to grow  resulting, ultimately, in the failure of First NBC.  The Bank’s failure cost the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s deposit insurance fund slightly under $1 billion.
For RYAN , the charges include, Count 1, conspiracy to commit bank fraud, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Sections 1344 and 1349, multiple instances of bank fraud as listed in  Counts 2 through 37, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1344 and making false entries in bank records, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1005, as listed in Counts 38 through 46.
For each of the charged counts, the maximum penalties that may be imposed upon conviction are thirty years in prison; a fine of up to $1,000,000, or the greater of twice the gain to a defendant or twice the loss to any victim; up to five years of supervised release; and a $100 mandatory special assessment fee.
This case was investigated by the FBI New Orleans, the FDIC Office of Inspector General in Dallas, and the Federal Reserve Board of Governors’ Office of Inspector General in Miami. Agents and analysts devoted thousands of hours in reviewing millions of pages of emails, account records, and loan documents to uncover this fraud.
“We respect the jury’s verdict as it pertains to both individuals, said U.S. Attorney Duane A. Evans. “I want to thank the jurors who have done a great public service in giving their time to listen and evaluate the evidence and to render their verdict. This was a theft of epic proportions that grew from within that ultimately harmed the New Orleans economy. This case shows the dedication of this office, along with our law enforcement partners to prosecuting crime wherever it happens. Be it on the streets of our neighborhoods, or in board rooms downtown, this office will dedicate the time and resources to investigate and bring culprits to justice.”
“Mr. Ryan’s willingness to ignore and flaunt all sound financial practices left the American taxpayers to foot the 1-billion-dollar bill which remained following First NBC’s collapse,” said Douglas A. Williams, Jr., Special Agent in Charge of FBI New Orleans.  “We thank our partners at the United States Attorney’s Office Eastern District, the FDIC Office of Inspector General and the Federal Reserve Board, Office of Inspector General. It is my hope that that today’s guilty verdict will result in some measure of justice for the more than 500 people who lost their jobs, and the countless stockholders who lost their financial investments.”
“The conviction of former FNBC President Ashton Ryan once again demonstrates that the  FDIC OIG, working with our law enforcement partners, will continue to  hold accountable bank executives who jeopardize the safety and soundness of our nation’s insured financial institutions,” said Anand Ramlall, Special Agent in Charge, Dallas Region, Office of Inspector General for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
“Ashton Ryan’s fraud scheme to deceive regulators and the public resulted in one of the largest bank failures since the financial crisis. His conviction sends a clear message that bank executives who commit fraud will be brought to justice for their actions. I commend our agent and our federal law enforcement partners for their hard work and persistence in this very complex case, which ultimately led to this conviction,” said Stephen Donnelly, Acting Special Agent in Charge, Eastern Region, Office of Inspector General for the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
The trial was prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys Matthew Payne, Nicholas Moses (Financial Crimes Unit), and Ryan McLaren (Appeals Unit).

Man Convicted for Multimillion-Dollar COVID-19 Relief Fraud
A federal jury convicted a Texas man today for his role in a scheme to fraudulently obtain and launder millions of dollars in forgivable Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (SBA) under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.
According to court documents and evidence presented at trial, Abdul Fatani, 57, of Richmond, conspired with others to submit fraudulent PPP loan applications by falsifying the number of employees and the average monthly payroll expenses of the applicant businesses. In total, the co-conspirators sought over $35 million through more than 80 fraudulent PPP loans. Fatani distributed over $500,000 in fraudulent loan proceeds to his co-conspirators and himself using bogus payroll checks and laundered a portion of the proceeds by transferring the funds from one of his bank accounts to another bank account he controlled.
Fatani was convicted of one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, one count of wire fraud, and one count of unlawful monetary transactions (money laundering). He is scheduled to be sentenced on May 8 and faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison for conspiracy and wire fraud and 10 years in prison for money laundering. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.
In addition, 15 other individuals have pleaded guilty to their involvement in the loan fraud scheme.

Former Arkansas State Senator Sentenced for Bribery and Tax Fraud
A former Arkansas State Senator was sentenced today to 46 months in prison in the Eastern District of Arkansas for accepting multiple bribes and tax fraud in connection with a multi-district investigation spanning the Eastern and Western Districts of Arkansas and the Western District of Missouri.
Pursuant to his global plea agreement, Jeremy Hutchinson, 48, of Little Rock, pleaded guilty on June 25, 2019, in the Eastern District of Arkansas to filing a false tax return; pleaded guilty on June 25, 2019, to an information filed in the Western District of Arkansas to conspiracy to commit federal program bribery; and pleaded guilty in the Western District of Missouri on July 8, 2019, to conspiracy to commit federal program bribery.
According to court documents, from 2010 through 2017, Hutchinson stole and misappropriated thousands of dollars in state campaign contributions for his own personal use and then filed false federal income tax returns from 2011 to 2014 to conceal his conduct. In addition, Hutchinson was hired as outside counsel by Dr. Benjamin Burris, an orthodontist who owned and operated orthodontic clinics throughout the state of Arkansas. In exchange for payments and legal work, Hutchinson pushed legislation beneficial to Burris. Hutchinson was provided legal work to conceal the corrupt nature of his arrangement. Hutchinson stole over $10,000 in state campaign funds for his own personal use and also falsified his 2011 tax returns, including failing to report $20,000-per-month-payments he received from one law firm and other sources of income he knowingly and intentionally concealed from his taxes.
Hutchinson is still pending sentencing in the Western District of Missouri for his role in a separate multimillion-dollar public corruption scheme that involved embezzlement, bribes, and illegal campaign contributions for elected public officials. According to court documents, Hutchinson accepted bribes in the form of monthly legal retainers and other things of value from employees and executives of Preferred Family Healthcare Inc. (formerly known as Alternative Opportunities Inc.), a Springfield, Missouri-based health care charity. In exchange for the bribes, Hutchinson provided favorable legislative and official action for the charity.
In 2022, Preferred Family Healthcare agreed to pay more than $8 million in forfeiture and restitution to the federal government and the state of Arkansas under the terms of a non-prosecution agreement, in which the charity admitted the criminal conduct of its former officers and employees.
Several former executives from the charity, former members of the Arkansas state legislature, and others have pleaded guilty in federal court as part of the long-running, multi-jurisdiction investigation, including the following:
Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Polite, Jr. of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Jonathan D. Ross for the Eastern District of Arkansas, U.S. Attorney David Clay Fowlkes for the Western District of Arkansas, U.S. Attorney Teresa A. Moore for the Western District of Missouri, Assistant Director Luis Quesada of the FBI’s Criminal Investigative Division, Special Agent in Charge Charles A. Dayoub of the FBI Kansas City Field Office, and Special Agent in Charge Christopher J. Altemus Jr. of the IRS Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI) Dallas Field Office made the announcement.
The FBI, IRS-CI, and the Offices of the Inspectors General from the Departments of Justice, Labor, and the FDIC investigated the cases.
Senior Litigation Counsel Marco A. Palmieri, Director of Enforcement & Litigation for the Election Crimes Branch Sean F. Mulryne, and Trial Attorney Jacob Steiner of the Criminal Division’s Public Integrity Section; Assistant U.S. Attorney Stephanie Mazzanti for the Eastern District of Arkansas; Supervisory Assistant U.S. Attorney Randall Eggert and Assistant U.S. Attorney Shannon T. Kempf for the Western District of Missouri; and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Aaron L. Jennen and Steven M. Mohlhenrich for the Western District of Arkansas are prosecuting the separate criminal cases. Former Assistant U.S. Attorneys Patrick Harris for the Eastern District of Arkansas and former Assistant U.S. Attorney Ben Wulff for the Western District of Arkansas provided significant assistance.

Pleasant Hill Man Sentenced to 6.5 Years in Prison for Billion Dollar DC Solar Ponzi Scheme,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/pleasant-hill-man-sentenced-65-years-prison-billion-dollar-dc,"January 31, 2023",2023,"Pleasant Hill Man Sentenced to 6.5 Years in Prison for Billion Dollar DC Solar Ponzi Scheme
SACRAMENTO, Calif. — Ryan Guidry, 45, of Pleasant Hill, was sentenced today to six years and six months in prison and ordered to pay $619,415,950 in restitution for participating in a billion-dollar Ponzi scheme involving DC Solar, U.S. Attorney Phillip A. Talbert announced.
On Jan. 14, 2020, Guidry pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit an offense against the United States and aiding and abetting money laundering.
According to court documents, between 2011 and 2018, DC Solar manufactured solar generators that were mounted on trailers known as mobile solar generator units (MSG). The company touted the versatility and environmental sustainability of the mobile solar generators and claimed that they were used to provide emergency power to cellphone towers and lighting at sporting and other events. Jeff Carpoff, 52, Paulette Carpoff, 49, both of Martinez, and their co-conspirators solicited investors by claiming that there were favorable federal tax benefits associated with investments in alternative energy. They sold more solar generators than they manufactured to investors, making it appear that solar generators existed in locations that they did not, creating false financial statements, and obtaining false lease contracts, among other efforts to conceal the fraud. In reality, 9,000 of the approximately 17,000 solar generators claimed to have been manufactured by DC Solar did not exist and DC Solar paid early investors with funds contributed by later investors.
According to court documents, Guidry worked at DC Solar from 2012 through 2019 and became Vice President of Operations by 2015. Guidry understood DC Solar’s business model and knew that investors were being defrauded. Guidry accepted $1 million that he knew came from deceived investors to get a signature on a false lease contract, and split another $20,000 in cash with Alan Hansen, 51, of Vacaville, an employee of a telecom company for forging a signature on a related agreement. Guidry fabricated a spreadsheet of fictitious MSG locations, and then Guidry and Jeff Carpoff moved MSGs to their supposed operation sites the day before or even the day of investor inspections. This was done to trick investors into believing that the MSGs had been deployed at those sites all along, when the opposite was true.
In 2017 and 2018 when DC Solar was no longer making the MSGs it was selling, Guidry scraped old VIN stickers off of MSGs and put new ones on them at DC Solar warehouses in Benicia and Las Vegas, working with Jeff Carpoff and others. The VIN switching was to trick investors during inspections into believing that MSGs associated with the transaction under inspection existed and could be found at the locations the company had asserted.
This case was the product of an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, IRS Criminal Investigation, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Christopher S. Hales and Kevin C. Khasigian prosecuted the case.
On Nov. 9, 2021, Jeff Carpoff was sentenced to 30 years in prison and ordered to pay $790.6 million in restitution for conspiracy to commit wire fraud and money laundering. His wife Paulette Carpoff pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit an offense against the United States and money laundering, and on June 28, 2022, was sentenced to 11 years and three months in prison.
On Nov. 16, 2021, Joseph W. Bayliss, 47, of Martinez, was sentenced to three years in prison and ordered to pay $481.3 million in restitution for securities fraud and conspiracy in connection with the DC Solar scheme. On April 12, 2022, DC Solar CFO Robert A. Karmann, 56, of Clayton, was sentenced to six years in prison and ordered to pay $624 million. On May 31, 2022, Alan Hansen was sentenced to eight years in prison for conspiracy to commit an offense against the United States and aiding and abetting money laundering.
Ronald J. Roach, 55, of Walnut Creek, pleaded guilty to criminal offenses related to the fraud scheme and is scheduled to be sentenced on March 14, 2023. Roach faces a maximum statutory penalty of 10 years prison. The actual sentence, however, will be determined at the discretion of the court after consideration of any applicable statutory factors and the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, which take into account a number of variables.

North-Central Florida Blimp Company Executive Sentenced To Over Five Years In Federal Prison For COVID-19 Relief Fraud
GAINESVILLE, FLORIDA – Patrick Parker Walsh, 42, Williston, Florida, was sentenced today, after previously pleading guilty to one count of wire fraud and one count of money laundering in connection to COVID-19 pandemic relief. Walsh was sentenced to 66 months in federal prison. The sentence was announced by Jason R. Coody, United States Attorney for the Northern District of Florida.
“The theft of any amount of taxpayer funds is inexcusable,” said U.S. Attorney Coody. “However, the defendant’s deceptive acts of diverting millions of dollars in emergency financial assistance from small businesses during the pandemic is simply beyond the pale. Today’s sentence both punishes the defendant’s criminal conduct and should serve as a significant deterrent to others who would selfishly steal from their fellow citizens to unlawfully enrich themselves. With our law enforcement partners, we remain committed to investigating and prosecuting those who engage in acts of covid-related fraud.”
Court documents reflect that between April 7, 2020, and January 21, 2021, Walsh submitted a total of 16 fraudulent applications to multiple federally insured financial institutions and other qualified lenders for Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) loans in the names of multiple businesses, including his blimp companies which were headquartered in Levy County.  Walsh’s false PPP loan applications included several discrepancies: no record of some employees that were listed in Walsh’s applications, that the number of employees listed in multiple applications was more than previously listed in employer tax records, and that some of the companies claimed in the applications were not even established businesses as of February 15, 2020 (the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic relief programs). Additional investigation revealed that Walsh had used several of the same employees on PPP loan applications for different companies.
“Today, the defendant in this case was brought to justice for exploiting Federal relief programs and using the obtained funds for his personal gain,” said Special Agent in Charge Kyle A. Myles, of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC-OIG).  “We will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to hold those accountable who take advantage of such programs and undermine the integrity of our Nation’s banking system.”
Walsh’s fraudulent PPP loan applications sought a total of $11,950,439 in PPP loan funds, of which he received a total of $4,996,167. Further, between March 2020 and July 2020, Walsh submitted a total of 18 fraudulent applications to the SBA for Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDLs), in his own name and in the name of his wife. Walsh’s false EIDL applications were approved and a total of $2,822,000 was disbursed to him.
“Taxpayers thinking about stealing from government relief programs should stop in their tracks and simply look at the consequences of taking the next step,” said Ronald A. Loecker IRS-CI Acting Special Agent in Charge. “Today's sentencing is the result of federal law enforcement banding together to enforce not only the nation's tax laws, but especially cases where someone, for their own personal benefit, steals resources from the American people.”
“This sentence demonstrates that those that steal taxpayer dollars will be held accountable,” said SBA OIG’s Eastern Region Special Agent in Charge Amaleka Brathwaite-McCall. “I want to thank the U.S. Department of Justice and our law enforcement partners for their dedication and pursuit of justice.”
Additionally, Walsh engaged in multiple monetary transactions that involved at least $10,000 of fraudulently obtained PPP loan or EIDL proceeds that he obtained through his wire fraud scheme. Many of these transactions included payments for the purchase of real estate in Florida and Texas, oil leases, and to pay off his mortgage loans.
“Patrick Walsh abused a program that was designed to ease suffering caused by the COVID-19 pandemic,” says Sherri E. Onks, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Jacksonville Division.  “Instead of using millions of dollars in federal funds to help keep struggling businesses afloat and honest workers employed, he selfishly diverted it for his own personal gain.  The FBI will hold accountable anyone who takes advantage of those in need during a national emergency, and we remain committed to working with our partners to ensure fraudsters are brought.”
The PPP, administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration (“SBA”), was designed to provide low-interest, forgivable loans to applicants to help fund certain permissible expenses for qualifying businesses amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, which included payroll costs, interest on mortgages, rent, and utilities.  The EIDL program, also administered by the SBA, was designed to provide low-interest loans to small businesses in regions affected by declared disasters. The CARES Act authorized the SBA to provide EIDLs, up to $2 million, to eligible small businesses experiencing substantial financial disruption due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Walsh’s imprisonment will be followed by three years of supervised release.  Additionally, Walsh was ordered to pay restitution to the SBA in the amount of $7,818,167, and the Court entered an order of forfeiture in the same amount.
This case was investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigation, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation-Office of Inspector General (FDIC-OIG), and the U.S. Small Business Administration-Office of Inspector General (SBA-OIG).  Assistant United States Attorneys Justin M. Keen and David Byron prosecuted the case.  Assistant United States Attorneys Justin M. Keen and David P. Byron prosecuted the case with the assistance of Assistant United States Attorney Katherine Kerwin, of the United States Attorney’s Financial Litigation Program.
This case was prosecuted as part the Department of Justice’s prosecution of fraud schemes that exploit the CARES Act relief programs. The CARES Act is a federal law enacted in March 2020, designed to provide emergency financial assistance to the millions of Americans suffering the economic effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. One of the two programs that were developed through CARES Act is the PPP. It provides funding to businesses through PPP loans for payroll costs, interest on mortgages, rent and utilities. PPP allows the interest and principal on loans to be forgiven if the business spends proceeds on certain expense items within a designated time and uses a certain percentage of the loan on payroll expenses. The Department of Justice remains vigilant in detecting, investigating, and prosecuting wrongdoing related to the crisis.

Nigerian National Sentenced to Prison for Role in Fraud and Money Laundering Scheme
HUNTINGTON, W.Va. – Kenneth Emeni, 30, a citizen of Nigeria residing in Martinsburg, was sentenced today to one year and one day in prison, to be followed by three years of supervised release, for conspiracy to commit money laundering. Emeni was also ordered to pay $904,126.96 in restitution.
According to court documents and statements made in court, from at least August 2017 to October 8, 2020, Emeni took part in a Huntington-based scheme that defrauded at least 200 victims, many of whom are elderly, of at least $2.5 million. Emeni’s co-conspirators created false personas to establish romantic, friendship or business relationships with unwitting individuals via email, text messaging or online dating and social media websites. The victims were persuaded to send money for a variety of false and fraudulent reasons for the benefit of the false personas.
Emeni admitted that he accepted money transfers from victims to his bank account that he knew was from unlawful activity. Once the victims’ funds were deposited in his account, Emeni kept some and forwarded some to his co-conspirators via wire transfers or the Zelle digital payments network. Emeni received approximately $42,050 transferred by his co-conspirators’ transfers and transferred approximately $46,197 to his co-conspirators during the money laundering conspiracy. Emeni further admitted that he and his co-conspirators transferred large sums of their fraud proceeds to offshore accounts. From 2018 until 2020, Emeni transferred over $358,846 to accounts in Nigeria and Ghana.
“This heartless conspiracy exploited individuals who often were particularly vulnerable, and wreaked havoc in their lives and that of their loved ones,” said United States Attorney Will Thompson. “I commend the investigative work of the United States Secret Service, the United States Postal Inspection Service, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation-Office of Inspector General (FDIC-OIG), the West Virginia State Police and the South Charleston Police Department.”
United States District Judge Robert C. Chambers imposed the sentence. Assistant United States Attorneys Kathleen Robeson and R. Gregory McVey prosecuted the case.

"Sacramento Man Sentenced to More than 3 Years in Prison for COVID-19 Relief Fraud, Embezzlement, and Unemployment Benefit Fraud",https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/sacramento-man-sentenced-more-3-years-prison-covid-19-relief,"December 12, 2022",2022,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. — Aaron Ashcraft, 42, of Sacramento, was sentenced today to three years and five months in prison after pleading guilty to carrying out a scheme to defraud the Paycheck Protection Program of over $1.2 million in COVID-19 relief loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (SBA) under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, U.S. Attorney Phillip A. Talbert announced.
According to court documents, between May 2020 and April 2021, Ashcraft submitted to lenders approved by the SBA at least seven fraudulent Paycheck Protection Program loan applications in the names of purported businesses. In the applications, Ashcraft falsely represented that each of the purported businesses had employees and monthly payroll expenses. To support the loan applications, Ashcraft submitted fabricated records, including IRS forms, checking account statements, and payroll summaries. In total, Ashcraft requested over $1.2 million in Paycheck Protection Program loans and obtained approximately $920,000.
In addition to Paycheck Protection Program fraud, Ashcraft admitted that, from September 2017 through June 2020, he embezzled at least approximately $780,000 from his former employer—a street-sweeping company in Sacramento. Ashcraft held multiple positions at the company, including chief financial officer. As chief financial officer, Ashcraft had access to the company’s business credit card accounts. Without authorization, Ashcraft used those accounts to pay for personal expenses.
Finally, Ashcraft admitted to defrauding the Maine Department of Labor. According to his plea agreement, in July 2020, Ashcraft applied for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, falsely claiming that he lived in Maine and was unable to work due to COVID-19.

Beverly Hills Father and Son Sentenced to Prison for Scheming to Defraud COVID-Relief Programs Designed to Help Businesses
LOS ANGELES – A Beverly Hills father and son were sentenced today to federal prison terms for defrauding government programs designed to help businesses survive the economic shock of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Ramiro Da Rosa Mendes, 61, was sentenced to 41 months in federal prison by United States District Judge Percy Anderson, who also ordered him to pay $2,228,302 in restitution.
In a separate case, Judge Anderson today sentenced Ammon Jose de Pina Mendes, 27, Ramiro’s son, to 21 months in federal prison and ordered him to pay $222,225 in restitution.
Ramiro and Ammon Mendes each pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud in September 2022.
From April 2020 to August 2020, Ramiro Mendes schemed to fraudulently obtain federal disaster relief funds distributed through the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) and Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) programs that were intended to help businesses during the pandemic.
Ramiro Mendes claimed to own numerous fake businesses purportedly based in Beverly Hills, including One Wilshire Enterprises, Professional Music Services, and MB Property Management Group LLC. These companies were fake businesses that did not exist prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and did not have any operations or employees.
He also claimed to be the owner of fake real estate services companies, including Ramiro Mendes Real Estate Services, Real Estate Services, and Real Estate Invesst-ments, also located in Beverly Hills and Massachusetts, as well as other businesses registered in Wyoming.
Ramiro Mendes submitted 19 applications for PPP and EIDL loans that contained false and fraudulent information, including the purported existence of payroll expenses, phony tax forms, and the operational status of the businesses.
For example, on June 24, 2020, Ramiro Mendes submitted a fraudulent PPP loan application to a Florida-based bank, seeking a loan of $975,100. The loan application falsely stated that One Wilshire Enterprises employed 18 people, had an average monthly payroll of $390,040, and, according to a false tax form, earned $4,810,149 in revenue in 2019. Based on this false information, the bank approved and funded a PPP loan in the amount of $793,300. The loan amount was wired into a bank account Mendes controlled.
Ramiro Mendes stole the COVID-relief loans and misused the proceeds for his own personal benefit, including the purchase of cryptocurrency. He further admitted that the intended loss in this case was approximately $6,708,963 and the actual loss was at least approximately $2,228,302.
Ammon Mendes admitted he used information from fake businesses to fraudulently obtain $225,225 in PPP and EIDL loans.
Another son of Ramiro Mendes – Mateus Pina Mendes, 33, of downtown Los Angeles – also previously pleaded guilty in September to wire fraud and admitted fraudulently obtaining $143,283 in PPP and EIDL loans. Mateus Mendes is scheduled to be sentenced on January 10, 2023.
This matter was investigated by the FBI; the Federal Housing Finance Agency – Office of the Inspector General; the United States Postal Inspection Service; the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation – Office of the Inspector General; the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration – Office of the Inspector General; IRS Criminal Investigation; and the Small Business Administration – Office of the Inspector General.
Assistant United States Attorney Scott Paetty of the Major Frauds Section and Trial Attorney Jennifer Bilinkas of the Justice Department’s Fraud Section are prosecuting this case.

Two Memphis Business Owners Charged in Pandemic Relief Fraud
Memphis, TN – A federal grand jury has indicted two Memphis business owners with conspiring to defraud the Federal Paycheck Protection Program of over $786,000. United States Attorney Kevin G. Ritz announced the indictment today.
Lisa Evans, 40, of Olive Branch, Mississippi, owner of USA Taxes in Memphis, and Kevin Shaw, 33, of Memphis, owner of Freight Masters, Inc., are charged with conspiring to commit bank fraud and making false statements to a federally insured bank. These offenses each carry a maximum penalty of 30 years in prison and a maximum fine of $1,000,000.
According to the indictment, the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) was a federal program administered by the Small Business Administration designed to provide emergency financial assistance to small businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The amount of a PPP loan that a small business may have been entitled to was determined by the number of employees and amount of payroll the business had. Evans and Shaw are alleged to have submitted a fraudulent PPP application for Shaw’s business, Freight Master’s Group Inc., to a bank participating in the PPP program. Evans is alleged to have provided Shaw with fake IRS documents to support his fraudulent application and then taking a kickback/fee from Shaw after Shaw obtained the $786,202 in loan proceeds.
U.S. Attorney Ritz said: “These federal aid programs were designed to lift hardworking citizens and small businesses in a time of need. But, as the indictment alleges, these individuals sought to defraud the aid programs. Thanks to our partners for investigating these offenses. We will continue to prosecute those who abuse and misuse COVID-19 relief funds.”
“Today’s arrests demonstrate the FDIC OIG, and our law enforcement partners continue to combat and prevent COVID-19 related fraud by investigating and holding accountable criminals who exploit the Paycheck Protection Program for personal gain via our nation’s banking system,” said Anand Ramlall, Special Agent in Charge, Dallas Region, Office of Inspector General for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
“The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration aggressively pursues those who attempt to abuse the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act and its Paycheck Protection Program, which was created to assist legitimate business owners during the pandemic,” said J. Russell George, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration. “We appreciate the efforts of our law enforcement partners and the United States Attorney’s Office to ensure individuals engaged in criminal activity are held to account.”
“The Secret Service remains steadfast in our commitment to investigating the exploitation of pandemic relief funds,” said Acting Special Agent in Charge Ben Zack Rogers. “We are thankful for the hard work and continued support of our partners as we work together to ensure that our country’s financial environment remains safe and secure.”
“Manufacturing false information to wrongfully obtain funds from SBA programs intended for the nation’s small businesses is a theft from taxpayers,” said SBA OIG’s Central Region Special Agent in Charge Sharon Johnson. “OIG is committed to rooting out bad actors and protecting the integrity of SBA programs. I want to thank the U.S. Attorney’s Office and our law enforcement partners for their dedication and pursuit of justice.”
“Celtic Bank and other members of the Federal Home Loan Banks support small businesses and their workers by properly distributing Paycheck Protection Program funds,” said Special Agent in Charge Edwin S. Bonano of FHFA-OIG’s Southeast Regional Office. “We are proud to work with our partners in the OIG community to root out PPP fraud and recover the taxpayer dollars intended for small business owners and employees under the CARES Act.”
The case was investigated by special agents with five different federal agencies – U.S. Secret Service, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), Office of Inspector General, Small Business Administration (SBA) Office of Inspector General, U.S. Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA), and the Federal Housing Finance Agency.
An indictment is an accusation. A defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.
United States Attorney Kevin Ritz thanked Assistant United States Attorney Tony Arvin, who is prosecuting this case.

Two Illinois Men Charged in Fraudulent Payment Processing Scheme,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/two-illinois-men-charged-fraudulent-payment-processing-scheme,"December 8, 2022",2022,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Two Illinois Men Charged in Fraudulent Payment Processing Scheme
A federal grand jury in Chicago returned an indictment charging two Illinois men with bank fraud in connection with payment processing companies they operated.
According to court documents, Michael D’Ambrose, 62, of Chicago, and Scott Apgar, 43, of Roscoe, operated a group of payment processing companies that deposited checks on behalf of merchant-clients. The checks typically were “remotely created checks” (RCCs), which were not signed by the account holder whose account was debited.
The indictment alleges that D’Ambrose and Apgar deceived banks about the nature of the payment processing companies’ business and financial transactions in order to open and maintain bank accounts and to allow for the processing of tens of millions of dollars of RCCs, which were purportedly authorized by consumers.
D’Ambrose and Apgar allegedly used those bank accounts to deposit RCCs on behalf of  merchant clients despite warning signs of fraud, including indications that merchant-clients were initiating unauthorized debits from the accounts of purported customers. As alleged in the indictment, the warning signs of fraud included consumer complaints and law enforcement and bank inquiries about unauthorized debits. The indictment further alleges that D’Ambrose and Apgar intentionally recruited clients that were having difficulty finding and keeping payment processing services elsewhere and, when seeking clients, touted their companies’ low standards for accepting clients.
According to the indictment, D’Ambrose and Apgar fraudulently manipulated the rates of returned deposits associated with the payment processing companies’ accounts. They allegedly did so by making small-dollar deposits known as micro-transactions, which increased the volume of deposits in an account, thereby causing the percentage of returned RCCs to appear smaller than it actually was. The defendants also allegedly submitted to banks documents that defendants knew contained false and fraudulent information about the nature of the payment processing companies’ operations.
Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton, head of the Justice Department’s Civil Division, U.S. Attorney John R. Lausch Jr. for the Northern District of Illinois, Acting Inspector in Charge Kai Pickens of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service Chicago Division and Special Agent in Charge Kathy A. Enstrom of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation-Office of Inspector General, Chicago Regional Office, made the announcement.
The indictment charges D’Ambrose and Apgar with 16 counts of bank fraud. If convicted, the defendants face a maximum term of imprisonment of 30 years for each count of bank fraud. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.
The U.S. Postal Inspection Service and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation-Office of Inspector General are investigating the case.
Trial Attorneys Daniel Zytnick and Timothy Finley of the Justice Department’s Consumer Protection Branch and Assistant U.S. Attorney Edward A. Liva Jr. for the Northern District of Illinois are prosecuting the case.
An indictment is merely an allegation and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.

Pastors of defunct church plead guilty to car loan and COVID-19 fraud
HOUSTON – Three locals associated with Jesus Survives Ministries have admitted to conspiracy to commit bank and wire fraud, announced U.S. Attorney Jennifer B. Lowery.
William Dexter Lucas aka Bill Lucas, 60, and Deborah Jean Lucas, 64, both of Bryan, pleaded guilty today while Brian Corpian, 45, Houston, entered his plea Dec. 2.
All three have admitted to making false statements and using false documents regarding the church to fraudulently obtain loan proceeds. Jesus Survives Ministries is a defunct church in which all three claimed to be pastors. Bill Lucas claimed to be lead pastor.
For almost the last decade there were no church services or pastoral services through Jesus Survives Ministries. Since 2014, the three made false statements regarding their payroll at the church in submitting car loan applications for purchases of cars on which they had no intent of making payments. Both Bill and Deborah Lucas were able to obtain cars through these false applications.
Within days following the enactment of Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act, Bill Lucas applied for multiple Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) Program and Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans from numerous banks. In them, he made false statements and provided false documents regarding Jesus Survives Ministries. Bill Lucas falsely claimed that Jesus Survives Ministries had gross revenues of almost a million dollars in 2019. Deborah Lucas and Brian Corpian signed some of the false documents and called bank employees and the Small Business Administration regarding the status of applications.
When Bill Lucas became frustrated with bank employees’ failure to review and fund the loans quickly, he would send accusatory and intimidating text messages and emails; including, “This is war!!!!!” “I curse you, your bank and you[r] whole family,” and “You extremists think I am playing with you. You started a war and I guarantee you that you[‘re] not walking away unscathed.” Bill Lucas also posted a diatribe on the Jesus Survives Ministries website calling one of the banks, “Minions of Satan” and sent a bank employee a photograph of the bank employee’s family, indicating Bill knew the names of the bank employee’s wife and son.
The intended loss amount totals hundreds of thousands of dollars. One of the banks appoved a PPP loan of $50,000 for Jesus Survives Ministries. Once they received the fraudulent proceeds, Deborah Lucas and Bill Lucas moved the money into another bank account and went on vacation to South Carolina using fraud proceeds.
The CARES Act is a federal law enacted March 27, 2020, to provide emergency financial assistance to the millions of Americans who are suffering the economic effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act included the PPP and EIDL programs for either forgivable loans or low-interest financing for small businesses.
U.S. District Judge Charles Eskridge will impose sentencing May 11, 2023. At that time, all three face up and face up to 30 years in prison and a possible $1 million fine.
They were permitted to remain on bond pending that hearing.
Homeland Security Investigations, Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, Small Business Administration and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation - Inspector General conducted the investigation. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Zahra Jivani Fenelon, Kate Suh and Kristine Rollinson are prosecuting the case.

Former Assistant Atlanta City Attorney and police officer charged in $7 million PPP fraud scheme
ATLANTA - Shelitha Robertson, who formerly served as an Assistant City Attorney and a police officer for the City of Atlanta, has been indicted for an alleged scheme to defraud the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), a federal stimulus program authorized as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.
“Robertson allegedly stole millions of dollars in taxpayer money intended to help small businesses stay afloat during the pandemic,” said U.S. Attorney Ryan K. Buchanan. “CARES Act loans were designed to help sustain small businesses during the pandemic, not to serve as a source of personal enrichment.  We will continue to vigorously investigate and prosecute anyone who fraudulently obtains these critical funds.”
“This indictment charges the defendant with defrauding a government stimulus program designed to help those most in need during the pandemic,” said Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Inspector General Jay N. Lerner.  “We will continue to work with U.S. Attorneys and our law enforcement partners to hold accountable individuals that aim to undermine the integrity of the banking sector. Trusted members of our communities, such as former law enforcement officers and public officials, should be held to the highest standards.”
“The Paycheck Protection Program was intended to help businesses keep their workforce employed during the COVID-19 crisis, not to fund a personal lifestyle,” said U.S. Small Business Administration Office of Inspector General Eastern Region Special Agent in Charge Amaleka McCall-Brathwaite. “OIG is committed to rooting out bad actors and protecting the integrity of SBA programs. I want to thank the U.S. Attorney’s Office and our law enforcement partners for their dedication and pursuit of justice.”
“The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration aggressively pursues those who attempt to abuse the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act and its Paycheck Protection Program, which was created to assist legitimate business owners during the pandemic,” said J. Russell George, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration.  “We appreciate the efforts of our law enforcement partners and the U.S. Attorney’s Office to ensure individuals engaged in criminal activity are held to account.”
According to U.S. Attorney Buchanan, the charges, and other information presented in court: Shelitha Robertson and other co-conspirators allegedly submitted fraudulent PPP loan applications on behalf of various companies they owned and controlled. The indictment alleges that Robertson fraudulently obtained over $7 million in PPP loan funds, which was not used for payroll or other permitted business expenses. Robertson allegedly used loan proceeds to purchase luxury items, including a Rolls-Royce, a motorcycle, and jewelry, and to transfer funds to family members and co-conspirators.
Shelitha Robertson, 60, of Atlanta, is charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud, and money laundering.  Members of the public are reminded that the indictment only contains charges.  The defendant is presumed innocent of the charges and it will be the government’s burden to prove the defendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt at trial.
This case is being investigated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC-OIG), the U.S. Small Business Administration Office of Inspector General (SBA-OIG), and Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA).
Assistant U.S. Attorney Bernita Malloy, and Trial Attorney Ariel Glasner of the DOJ Criminal Division’s Fraud Section, are prosecuting the case.
The Fraud Section leads the Criminal Division’s prosecution of fraud schemes that exploit the PPP. Since the inception of the CARES Act, the Fraud Section has prosecuted over 192 defendants in more than 121 criminal cases and has seized over $78 million in cash proceeds derived from fraudulently obtained PPP funds, as well as numerous real estate properties and luxury items purchased with such proceeds. More information can be found at https://www.justice.gov/criminal-fraud/ppp-fraud .
In May 2021 the Attorney General established the COVID-19 Fraud Enforcement Task Force to marshal the resources of the Department of Justice in partnership with agencies across government to enhance efforts to combat and prevent pandemic-related fraud. The Task Force bolsters efforts to investigate and prosecute the most culpable domestic and international criminal actors and assists agencies tasked with administering relief programs to prevent fraud by augmenting and incorporating existing coordination mechanisms, identifying resources and techniques to uncover fraudulent actors and their schemes, and sharing and harnessing information and insights gained from prior enforcement efforts.

MINNEAPOLIS – A Wisconsin man has been indicted for orchestrating a $35 million bank fraud scheme, announced U.S. Attorney Andrew M. Luger.
According to court documents, between 2020 and August 2022, Matthew Thomas Onofrio, 31, of Eau Claire, devised and executed a scheme to defraud multiple federally-insured banks including MidCountry Bank headquartered in Bloomington.

Prince George’s County Man Pleads Guilty to a Federal Wire Fraud Conspiracy to Obtain Over $750,000 in COVID-19 CARES Act Loans and Unemployment Insurance Benefits
Greenbelt , Maryland – Jaleel Phillips, age 25, of Capital Heights, Maryland, pleaded guilty today to a federal wire fraud conspiracy, in relation to a scheme to unlawfully obtain COVID-19 relief loans and unemployment benefits.
The guilty plea was announced by United States Attorney for the District of Maryland Erek L. Barron; Acting Special Agent in Charge Troy W. Springer, of the Washington Regional Office, U.S. Department of Labor - Office of Inspector General; Special Agent in Charge Darrell J. Waldon of the Internal Revenue Service - Criminal Investigation, Washington, D.C. Field Office; Special Agent in Charge Amaleka McCall-Brathwaite of the Small Business Administration - Office of Inspector General, Eastern Region, and Acting Special Agent in Charge Quenton Sallows, of the Mid-Atlantic Region, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC-OIG).
According to his plea agreement, electronic records linked Jaleel Phillips and his co-conspirator to a number of fraudulent Paycheck Protection Program loan applications (PPP), Economic Injury Disaster loan applications (EIDL), and unemployment insurance claims.  As detailed in the statement of facts, Phillips and his co-conspirator created fictitious aliases, used the personal identifying information of real people, and used defunct corporate entities or new business entities with no actual business operations to apply for EIDL and PPP loans, and unemployment benefits.
Phillips admitted that as part of the conspiracy, several financial accounts and email accounts were opened using aliases that had been used to apply for the fraudulent benefits, including “Kenneth Williams,” “Allen Gator,” “Lawrence Robinson,” and “Jordan Gilmore.”  The fraudulently obtained PPP and EIDL loans and unemployment insurance claims were deposited into the bank accounts opened in the names of the aliases.  The money was then withdrawn by Phillips and his co-conspirator through ATM withdrawals and purchases made on the associated debit and credit cards or transferred between the various financial accounts established in the aliases’ names.  For example, Phillips engaged in multiple online and in-store transactions using debit cards embossed with the names of multiple fake identities and tied to bank accounts used in the fraud.  Phillips admitted that he had access to accounts and debit cards receiving more than $750,000 in fraudulently obtained COVID-19 benefits.
“This was a brazen scheme of staggering proportions,” said Darrell J. Waldon, IRS Criminal Investigation Special Agent in Charge of the Washington D.C. Field Office. “The defendant and his co-conspirator prioritized their own greed, submitting a number of fraudulent Paycheck Protection Program loan applications, Economic Injury Disaster loan applications, and unemployment insurance claims. Today’s plea sends a clear message that the IRS Criminal Investigation Special Agents and our law enforcement partners, remain vigilant and will vigorously pursue those who attempt to enrich themselves through fraudulent means.”
Jaleel Phillips faces a maximum sentence of 30 years in federal prison for the wire fraud conspiracy.  Actual sentences for federal crimes are typically less than the maximum penalties.  A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after taking into account the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.  No sentencing date has been set by the Court.
On May 17, 2021, the Attorney General established the COVID-19 Fraud Enforcement Task Force to marshal the resources of the Department of Justice in partnership with agencies across government to enhance efforts to combat and prevent pandemic-related fraud. The Task Force bolsters efforts to investigate and prosecute the most culpable domestic and international criminal actors and assists agencies tasked with administering relief programs to prevent fraud by, among other methods, augmenting and incorporating existing coordination mechanisms, identifying resources and techniques to uncover fraudulent actors and their schemes, and sharing and harnessing information and insights gained from prior enforcement efforts.

The Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) is a federal loan program intended to help small businesses survive the COVID-19 pandemic by providing them with funds to cover certain payroll costs, including benefits, interest on mortgages, rent and utilities. The Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) is a separate federal program providing low-interest loans and grants to small businesses that experience substantial financial disruptions due to federally-declared disasters, including the COVID-19 pandemic.
According to court documents and information presented in court, from May to August 2020, Mills submitted multiple applications for PPP and EIDL funds on behalf of three businesses under his control, Kanaka Maoli Hookupu Center, New Way Horizon Travel, and Uilani Kawailehua Foundation, each time utilizing interstate wires. To support the applications, Mills submitted fraudulent payroll documents and IRS forms, which included false employee and wage payment records. As a result of these applications, Mills received $937,575 in the form of three forgivable PPP loans and one EIDL grant to which he was not entitled.
At the sentencing hearing, the prosecution highlighted the fact Mills used the federal relief money to fund personal expenses, including the purchase of eight vehicles and two residential properties. When Chief Judge Watson imposed the sentence, he stated: “Stealing one million dollars of federal funds is no joke.”
“Carey Mills stole federal funds that provided a lifeline to our small businesses struggling as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic,” said U.S. Attorney Clare E. Connors. “While this is the first COVID-19 program fraud sentencing in the District of Hawaii, the Department is committed to investigating and prosecuting those who, like Mills, harmed both small businesses in need of these PPP and EIDL funds as well as the taxpayers who supported these programs.”
“The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration aggressively pursues those who attempt to abuse the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act and its Paycheck Protection Program, which was created to assist legitimate business owners during the pandemic,” said J. Russell George, Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration. “We appreciate the efforts of our law enforcement partners and the United States Attorney’s Office to ensure individuals engaged in criminal activity are held to account.”
The investigation was conducted by the U.S. Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, together with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of the Inspector General, the Small Business Administration Office of the Inspector General, and Homeland Security Investigations. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Rebecca M. Perlmutter and Gregg Paris Yates handled the prosecution.
On May 17, 2021, the Attorney General established the COVID-19 Fraud Enforcement Task Force to marshal the resources of the Department of Justice in partnership with agencies across government to enhance efforts to combat and prevent pandemic-related fraud. The Task Force bolsters efforts to investigate and prosecute the most culpable domestic and international criminal actors and assists agencies tasked with administering relief programs to prevent fraud by, among other methods, augmenting and incorporating existing coordination mechanisms, identifying resources and techniques to uncover fraudulent actors and their schemes, and sharing and harnessing information and insights gained from prior enforcement efforts.

Somerset County Man Admits $850,000 Paycheck Protection Program Fraud Scheme
TRENTON, N.J. – A Somerset County, New Jersey, man admitted fraudulently obtaining over $850,000 in federal Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans U.S. Attorney Philip R. Sellinger, announced today.
Butherde Darius, 50, of North Plainfield, New Jersey, pleaded guilty before U.S. District Judge Peter G. Sheridan in Trenton federal court on Nov. 21, 2022, to an information charging him with one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud, and one count of money laundering.
According to documents filed in this case and statements made in court:
Darius conspired with at least one individual to submit a fraudulent PPP loan application to a lender on behalf of a purported business that he controlled, obtaining over $850,000. He engaged in various financial transactions with the fraudulently obtained loan proceeds. The application Darius and his conspirator submitted contained fraudulent representations to the lender – a Federal Home Loan Bank member – and the SBA, including bogus federal tax documents purportedly from the IRS. Darius also fabricated the existence of employees and wages paid through the purported businesses. According to IRS records, however, none of the purported tax documents that were submitted in support of the loan applications were ever filed with the IRS. Darius loan application for his purported business was approved for approximately $852,000 in federal COVID-19 emergency relief funds meant for distressed small businesses.  Darius then used a portion of the proceeds for various personal expenses.
The count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud carries a maximum penalty of 30 years in prison and a $1 million fine. The count of money laundering carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a maximum fine of $250,000. Sentencing is scheduled for March 6, 2023.

Camden County Resident Sentenced to 41 Months in Prison for Defrauding COVID-19 Relief Programs and Illegally Possessing Firearm
CAMDEN, N.J. – A Camden County, New Jersey, resident was sentenced to 41 months in prison for his role in fraudulently obtaining Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) and Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL) benefits, fraudulently obtaining unemployment benefits, and illegally possessing a firearm, U.S. Attorney Philip R. Sellinger announced today.
Stephen Bennett, 46, of Berlin, New Jersey, previously pleaded guilty before U.S. District Judge Karen M. Williams to an information charging him with one count of bank fraud conspiracy, one count of wire fraud, and one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm.  Judge Williams imposed the sentence on Nov. 21, 2022, in Camden federal court.
According to documents filed in this case and statements made in court:
In 2020, Bennett conspired with Rhonda Thomas, 38, of Sicklerville, New Jersey, to submit one PPP application and one EIDL application for a company controlled by Bennett. The applications stated that the company had 16 employees, gross revenues of $1.73 million, and an average monthly payroll of $144,000, when in fact the company had no employees, revenue, or payroll. Bennett and Thomas also submitted forged tax forms and altered bank statements as part of the PPP loan application.  Based on the misrepresentations, the loans were approved in the amount of $510,000. Bennett paid kickbacks of over $150,000 to Thomas and used the rest of the fraudulently obtained PPP and EIDL loan proceeds to pay for personal expenses.
Also in 2020, Bennett defrauded the Pennsylvania Department of Labor by submitting 74 unemployment insurance claims under a temporary federal unemployment insurance program that provided benefits for individuals who were not eligible for other types of unemployment, such those who were self-employed, independent contractors or gig economy workers. Bennett collected personal identification information (PII), including names, residential addresses, and Social Security numbers, of other individuals and used the PII to submit fraudulent applications for unemployment benefits, resulting in the payment of $425,339 in benefits to Bennett.
In May 2021, law enforcement officials executing a search warrant at Bennett’s home found a .9 millimeter semiautomatic pistol with no serial number (commonly referred to as a “ghost gun”) and a magazine loaded with 16 rounds of ammunition. Bennett is a previously convicted felon.
In addition to the prison term, Judge Williams sentenced Bennett to five years of supervised release, fined him $15,000, and ordered him to pay restitution of $942,141.
Thomas pleaded pleaded guilty before Judge Williams on June 28, 2022, to an information charging her with one count of bank fraud conspiracy and one count of money laundering and is scheduled to be sentenced on Dec. 16, 2022.
U.S. Attorney Sellinger credited special agents of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation – Office of Inspector General, under the direction of Patricia Tarasca, Special Agent-in-Charge, New York Regional Office, special agents of the Social Security Administration, Office of the Inspector General, New York Field Division, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Sharon MacDermott; special agents of the FBI’s South Jersey Resident Agency, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Jacqueline Maguire in Philadelphia, special agents of the U.S. Department of Labor, Office of Inspector General, New York Region, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Jonathan Mellone, with the investigation leading to today’s sentencing.
The government is represented by Assistant U.S. Attorney Daniel A. Friedman and Jason M. Richardson, Attorney in Charge of the U.S. Attorney’s Office’s Criminal Division in Camden.

Murrieta Man Sentenced to 5 Years in Prison for Misusing COVID-Relief Business Loans on Personal Expenses Such as Luxury Cars
LOS ANGELES – A Riverside County man was sentenced today to 60 months in federal prison for using hundreds of thousands of dollars from the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) for personal expenses such as luxury cars after he obtained a COVID-business relief loan for more than $7 million on behalf of his pothole-repair company.
Oumar Sissoko, 59, of Murrieta, was sentenced by United States District Judge John F. Walter, who also ordered him to pay $499,827 in restitution.
On April 15, at the conclusion of a three-day trial, a jury found Sissoko guilty of four counts of wire fraud.
The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act is a federal law enacted in March 2020 and is designed to provide emergency financial assistance to the millions of Americans who are suffering the economic effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. One source of relief provided by the CARES Act was the authorization of up to $349 billion in forgivable loans to small businesses for job retention and certain other expenses, through the PPP. In April 2020, Congress authorized more than $300 billion in additional PPP funding.
Sissoko obtained a $7.25 million loan for his downtown Los Angeles-based company, Road Doctor California LLC, after submitting a PPP loan application in April 2020.
In the loan application, Sissoko claimed that Road Doctor was in the process of hiring 450 full-time employees and would have average monthly payroll expenses of $2.9 million. When he applied for the loan, Sissoko acknowledged the funds would be used to retain workers and maintain payroll, or make mortgage interest payments, lease payments and utility payments.
In the days after the PPP loan was funded on May 1, 2020, Sissoko misappropriated hundreds of thousands of dollars of the loan proceeds to use for impermissible purposes, including purchasing a Mercedes-Benz for $113,000, paying off a loan on a BMW, and buying an Apple computer for more than $5,000.
The illegal uses of the loan also included a non-refundable down payment of approximately $100,000 to purchase a company located in New Hampshire and the attempted transmission of approximately $150,000 to accounts in the African nation of Mauritania associated with a mineral-exploration company for which Sissoko purported to serve as CEO.
On March 24, a federal jury deadlocked on the charges against Sissoko and a mistrial was declared. A second trial resulted in Sissoko’s criminal conviction.
Assistant United States Attorney Carolyn S. Small of the Major Frauds Section and DOJ Trial Attorney Theodore Kneller of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section are prosecuting this case. Assistant United States Attorney Jonathan S. Galatzan, Chief of the Asset Forfeiture and Recovery Section, is providing substantial assistance, including with the seizure and forfeiture of two luxury automobiles purchased with PPP loan funds.

Two Pharmacy Owners Plead Guilty in COVID-19 Money Laundering and Health Care Fraud Case
Two New York men pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit money laundering for using New York-area pharmacies to submit false and fraudulent claims to Medicare and then laundering the criminal proceeds.
Arkadiy Khaimov, 39, of Forest Hills, pleaded guilty today to one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. Peter Khaim, 42, also of Forest Hills, pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering on Nov. 3.
According to court documents, Khaim and Khaimov engaged in a complex money laundering conspiracy to launder the proceeds of a fraudulent health care scheme involving over a dozen New York-area pharmacies that they and their co-conspirators owned and controlled. Specifically, Khaim and Khaimov used the New York pharmacies to submit millions of dollars in fraudulent claims to Medicare, including during the COVID-19 pandemic. These fraudulent claims included claims for expensive cancer medications Targretin Gel 1% and Panretin Gel 0.1% that were not prescribed by physicians or dispensed to patients, and that were purportedly dispensed during periods when certain pharmacies were closed. Khaim, Khaimov, and their co-conspirators exploited the COVID-19 emergency for their own financial gain by using COVID-19-related “emergency override” billing codes to submit additional fraudulent claims for Targretin Gel 1%.
To conceal over $18 million of their criminal proceeds, Khaim, Khaimov, and their co-conspirators funneled money through several shell companies, including sham pharmacy wholesale companies designed to look like legitimate wholesalers. Khaim and Khaimov typically sent the funds from the pharmacy bank accounts they controlled to the sham wholesale companies. The funds were then typically sent to companies in China for distribution to individuals in Uzbekistan and the defendants received some of these funds in cash. At other times, the fraudulent proceeds were sent from the sham wholesale companies to Khaim, Khaimov, their relatives, or their designees, in the form of certified cashier’s checks and cash. Khaim and Khaimov used the proceeds of the scheme to purchase real estate and other luxury items.
Khaimov is scheduled to be sentenced on May 3, 2023. Khaim is scheduled to be sentenced on May 10, 2023. They each face a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.

Indian National Charged in $8 Million COVID-19 Relief Fraud Scheme
A federal grand jury in Newark, New Jersey, returned an indictment today charging an Indian national for fraudulently obtaining millions of dollars in Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (SBA) under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.
According to court documents, Abhishek Krishnan, 40, previously resided in Wake County, North Carolina, before returning to his home country of India. After returning to India, Krishnan allegedly submitted numerous fraudulent PPP loan applications to federally insured banks, including on behalf of purported companies that were not registered business entities. The fraudulent PPP loan applications allegedly included false statements about the companies’ employees and payroll expenses, as well as falsified tax filings. As part of the fraud scheme, Krishnan allegedly used the name of another person without that person’s authority. Krishnan allegedly submitted at least 17 PPP loan applications seeking over $8.2 million and received more than $3.3 million in loan proceeds. Following receipt of the funds, Krishnan allegedly laundered the proceeds of the fraud.
Krishnan is charged with two counts of wire fraud, two counts of money laundering, and two counts of aggravated identify theft. If convicted, Krishnan faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison on each of the top counts and a mandatory minimum of two years in prison on each count of aggravated identify theft. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.

In a separate case, Krishnan was recently charged in the Eastern District of North Carolina with theft of government property and aggravated identity theft regarding his alleged receipt of unemployment insurance benefits funded by the federal government in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Fraud Section leads the Criminal Division’s prosecution of fraud schemes that exploit the PPP. Since the inception of the CARES Act, the Fraud Section has prosecuted over 150 defendants in more than 95 criminal cases and has seized over $75 million in cash proceeds derived from fraudulently obtained PPP funds, as well as numerous real estate properties and luxury items purchased with such proceeds.

Berwick Bank Officer Sentenced To 12 Months’ Imprisonment
WILLIAMSPORT - The United States Attorney’s Office for the Middle District of Pennsylvania announced that Matthew W. Mensinger, age 49, of Berwick, Pennsylvania, was sentenced by United States Chief District Judge Matthew W. Brann, to 12 months of imprisonment for perpetrating a scheme to obtain bank loans through false statements.
According to United States Attorney Gerard M. Karam, Mensinger was the Chief Lending Officer of a Berwick, Pennsylvania-based financial institution.  Between approximately November 2011 and June 2020, Mensinger persuaded family members and business owners to obtain approximately $690,000 in loans from his financial institution, by submitting false loan applications purportedly for small business purposes and home mortgages.  Mensinger, in turn, authorized and facilitated the loan approvals in his position as a financial institution officer.  In fact, however, the individuals provided the money to Mensinger, who did not qualify to obtain the loans in his own right, and who promised that he would repay the loans.
In addition to Mensinger’s sentence of imprisonment, Chief Judge Brann also ordered him to perform 30 hours of community service, and to pay the remaining restitution owed to the financial institution, of over $290,000.
The case was investigated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s Office of the Inspector General, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  Assistant U.S. Attorney Phillip J. Caraballo prosecuted the case.

South Bay Man Sentenced to 9 Years in Federal Prison for Role in Scam Involving Fake Open Houses at Not-for-Sale Homes
LOS ANGELES – A South Bay man, who along with his sister and other co-conspirators participated in a $6 million real estate scam that listed homes for sale without owners’ consent and collected money from multiple would-be buyers, was sentenced today to 108 months in federal prison.
Adolfo Schoneke, 45, of Torrance, who pleaded guilty in May to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, was sentenced by United States District Judge R. Gary Klausner. A restitution hearing was scheduled for December 12.
Schoneke’s sister, Bianca Gonzalez, 39, pleaded guilty in April, admitting her role in the wire fraud scheme, and is scheduled to be sentenced on May 22, 2023.
Schoneke and his sister, along with co-conspirators, operated real estate and escrow companies based in Cerritos, La Palma and Long Beach under a variety of names, including MCR and West Coast Realty Services. Schoneke and the other members of the conspiracy located properties to list for sale – even though they did not intend to sell the properties to anyone, and in many instances the properties were not for sale at all.
The properties were listed on real estate websites such as the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) and were marketed as short sale opportunities. In some cases, the homes were marketed through open houses arranged by tricking homeowners or occupants into allowing their homes to be used.
“The fraud scheme [Schoneke] invented, proposed to his co-conspirators, and carried out involved uniquely devious means designed to steal money from as many victims as possible,” according to a sentencing memorandum filed by prosecutors. “Playing on the dream of home ownership and seemingly out of reach home prices, [Schoneke] figured out a way to ‘sell’ homes that he did not own and had no business in listing for sale.”
Multiple offers were accepted for each of the not-for-sale properties, but the co-conspirators hid this fact from the victims and instead led victims to believe their offer was the only one accepted. The co-conspirators strung victims along – sometimes for years – by telling them closings were being delayed because lenders needed to approve the purported short sales.
Office workers opened bank accounts to hide the co-conspirators’ involvement in the fraud. Those accounts were used to receive down payments on the homes and other payments from victims who were convinced to transfer the full “purchase price” after receiving forged short sale approval letters. The co-conspirators directed the office workers to withdraw large amounts of cash from these accounts, which made the proceeds harder to trace.
Schoneke “and his co-conspirators used numerous properties to further the fraudulent scheme, and collected more than $11.7 million from victims as part of the scheme (involving more than 860 transfers from approximately 750 or more victims),” according to the sentencing memo. “Although some of the victims were paid back, the scheme caused more than $6 million in losses to nearly 400 victims.”
In a related case, Mario Gonzalez (no relation to Bianca Gonzalez), 51, of Garden Grove, pleaded guilty in 2019 to conspiracy to commit wire fraud and is scheduled to be sentenced on April 3, 2023.
The FBI and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of Inspector General investigated this matter. The investigation was initiated by numerous complaints to the Long Beach Police Department and the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department, both of which provided substantial assistance during the federal investigation.
Assistant United States Attorney Kerry L. Quinn of the Major Frauds Section is prosecuting this case.

Former Hollywood Executive Sentenced to over 3 Years in Federal Prison for Fraudulently Obtaining $1.7 Million in COVID-Relief Loans
LOS ANGELES – The former chairman and CEO of Beverly Hills-based Aviron Pictures was sentenced today to 41 months in federal prison for applying for and receiving $1.7 million in loans under the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) for Aviron entities when the entire operation was being shuttered because of his embezzlement.
William Sadleir, 68, of Beverly Hills, was sentenced by United States District Judge Dolly M. Gee, who also ordered him to pay $282,566 in restitution.
Sadleir pleaded guilty on March 16 to one count of bank fraud and one count of money laundering.
In April 2020, Sadleir – who had been terminated from Aviron Pictures four months earlier after a major company investor discovered he had embezzled company funds – filed bank loan applications that fraudulently sought more than $1.7 million dollars in forgivable PPP loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (SBA) under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. Sadleir obtained the loans for three Aviron entities by falsely representing that the funds would be used to support payroll expenses for 33 employees at each company, when in fact the entities were no longer operational.
Within days of the loans being funded on May 1, 2020, Sadleir transferred nearly $1 million to his personal checking account.
Sadleir spent most of the fraudulently obtained loan proceeds on utility bills, mortgage expenses, and his personal lawyer. He did not use any of the fraudulent loan proceeds to pay employees of the Aviron companies.
Following the discovery of the fraudulent loan applications, federal agents seized $308,058 of fraudulent loan proceeds from an Aviron account, and Sadleir returned $1,122,090 to the bank that funded the loans. As a result of the fraudulent PPP loan scheme, the SBA suffered losses of $282,566.
On September 9, Sadleir was sentenced in the Southern District of New York to https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/hollywood-executive-and-former-white-house-staffer-sentenced-six-years-prison 72 months in federal prison after pleading guilty to two wire fraud counts for misappropriating more than $25 million that had been invested in Aviron. Judge Gee today ordered that the sentence imposed in the Los Angeles will run concurrent to the six-year sentence in the New York case.
The FBI, the SBA’s Office of Inspector General, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s Office of Inspector General investigated the Los Angeles matter.
Assistant United States Attorney Gregory Bernstein of the Major Frauds Section prosecuted this case.

Former Hollywood Executive Sentenced to over 3 Years in Federal Prison for Fraudulently Obtaining $1.7 Million in COVID-Relief Loans,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/former-hollywood-executive-sentenced-over-3-years-federal-prison,"October 18, 2022",2022,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Former Hollywood Executive Sentenced to over 3 Years in Federal Prison for Fraudulently Obtaining $1.7 Million in COVID-Relief Loans
LOS ANGELES – The former chairman and CEO of Beverly Hills-based Aviron Pictures was sentenced today to 41 months in federal prison for applying for and receiving $1.7 million in loans under the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) for Aviron entities when the entire operation was being shuttered because of his embezzlement.
William Sadleir, 68, of Beverly Hills, was sentenced by United States District Judge Dolly M. Gee, who also ordered him to pay $282,566 in restitution.
Sadleir pleaded guilty on March 16 to one count of bank fraud and one count of money laundering.
In April 2020, Sadleir – who had been terminated from Aviron Pictures four months earlier after a major company investor discovered he had embezzled company funds – filed bank loan applications that fraudulently sought more than $1.7 million dollars in forgivable PPP loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (SBA) under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. Sadleir obtained the loans for three Aviron entities by falsely representing that the funds would be used to support payroll expenses for 33 employees at each company, when in fact the entities were no longer operational.
Within days of the loans being funded on May 1, 2020, Sadleir transferred nearly $1 million to his personal checking account.
Sadleir spent most of the fraudulently obtained loan proceeds on utility bills, mortgage expenses, and his personal lawyer. He did not use any of the fraudulent loan proceeds to pay employees of the Aviron companies.
Following the discovery of the fraudulent loan applications, federal agents seized $308,058 of fraudulent loan proceeds from an Aviron account, and Sadleir returned $1,122,090 to the bank that funded the loans. As a result of the fraudulent PPP loan scheme, the SBA suffered losses of $282,566.
On September 9, Sadleir was sentenced in the Southern District of New York to https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/hollywood-executive-and-former-white-house-staffer-sentenced-six-years-prison 72 months in federal prison after pleading guilty to two wire fraud counts for misappropriating more than $25 million that had been invested in Aviron. Judge Gee today ordered that the sentence imposed in the Los Angeles will run concurrent to the six-year sentence in the New York case.
The FBI, the SBA’s Office of Inspector General, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s Office of Inspector General investigated the Los Angeles matter.
Assistant United States Attorney Gregory Bernstein of the Major Frauds Section prosecuted this case.
In May 2021, the Attorney General established the COVID-19 Fraud Enforcement Task Force to marshal the resources of the Department of Justice in partnership with agencies across government to enhance efforts to combat and prevent pandemic-related fraud. The Task Force bolsters efforts to investigate and prosecute the most culpable domestic and international criminal actors and assists agencies tasked with administering relief programs to prevent fraud by, among other methods, augmenting and incorporating existing coordination mechanisms, identifying resources and techniques to uncover fraudulent actors and their schemes, and sharing and harnessing information and insights gained from prior enforcement efforts.

Bank CEO Sentenced To 14 Months In Prison For Taking Bribes In Connection With Loans Guaranteed By The Small Business Administration,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/bank-ceo-sentenced-14-months-prison-taking-bribes-connection,"October 6, 2022",2022,"Damian Williams, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, announced today that defendant EDWARD SHIN, a/k/a “Eungsoo Shin,” was sentenced to 14 months in prison for his role in defrauding a Pennsylvania-based bank (the “Bank”) while serving as its CEO.  SHIN was convicted after a three-week trial before U.S. District Judge John P. Cronan on all counts, which charged SHIN with taking bribes in connection with the Bank’s issuance of loans that were guaranteed by the United States Small Business Administration (“SBA”) and with causing the Bank to issue SBA-guaranteed and commercial loans to companies in which SHIN had a secret financial interest.
U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said: “As CEO, Edward Shin was entrusted with stewardship of a Pennyslvania-based bank.  Instead of promoting and protecting the bank’s interests, Shin used the bank as his own piggy bank, stealing from it to line his pockets and the pockets of his corrupt friends.  For violating the trust placed in him, Shin will rightly serve prison time.”
According to the allegations contained in the Criminal Complaint, Indictment, and evidence adduced during trial:
The SBA helps Americans start, build, and grow businesses by guaranteeing certain loans made by banks to help those businesses succeed.  Between 2009 and 2013, the Bank offered a range of financial products, including SBA-guaranteed loans to small businesses in the New York-New Jersey area, which the Bank could extend only on the condition that all aspects of those loans complied with SBA regulations and SBA’s standard operating procedures.  In particular, SBA regulations and procedures prohibited bank officers, including SHIN, from receiving any payments in connection with SBA-backed loans and prohibited banks from extending such loans to any institution in which a bank officer held an interest.
Notwithstanding these regulations, SHIN, then the CEO of the Bank, secretly solicited and received bribe payments in connection with SBA-guaranteed loans issued by the Bank and caused the Bank to extend SBA-guaranteed and commercial loans to companies in which SHIN had secret ownership interests.  Specifically, when the Bank issued business loans that did not involve the use of any actual broker, SHIN nonetheless arranged to have his longtime friend, a real estate and loan broker (the “Broker”), inserted unnecessarily into the transaction solely to generate a broker fee that could be shared with SHIN; in fact, the Broker did no actual work to earn a commission on those transactions but split the “broker’s fee” with SHIN as an illegal kickback.
SHIN also arranged for the Bank to issue SBA-guaranteed loans to several businesses in which he secretly retained an ownership interest, in violation of SBA regulations and procedures.  For example, in or about June 2010, the Bank issued an SBA-guaranteed loan for approximately $950,000 to a business in New York, New York.  Although documents submitted to the Bank for purposes of securing the loan did not mention SHIN’s financial interest, the business was secretly operated as a partnership between SHIN, the Broker, and another individual.  The loan ultimately went into default status, resulting in a loss to the Bank of approximately $591,278.60.  On another occasion, in or about 2013, the Bank issued an SBA-guaranteed loan for approximately $1,050,000 to a business in New York, New York.  Again, even though the business was secretly operated as a partnership between SHIN and another family member of SHIN’s, the documents submitted to the Bank for purposes of securing the loan did not mention SHIN’s financial interest nor the family member’s relationship to SHIN.
*                *                *
SHIN, 59, of Ambler, Pennsylvania, was convicted at trial of one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud and wire fraud affecting a financial institution, one count of conspiracy to commit bank bribery, one count of conspiracy to commit loan fraud, another count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud, and one count each of bank bribery and embezzlement of funds by a bank officer.  In addition to the prison terms, Judge Cronan sentenced SHIN to three years of supervised release and ordered SHIN to pay forfeiture in the amount of $5,506,050 and a $600 special assessment fee.
Mr. Williams praised the outstanding investigative work of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation – Office of Inspector General, Homeland Security Investigations, the SBA Office of the Inspector General, and the Office of the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program.
This case is being handled by the Office’s Money Laundering and Transnational Criminal Enterprises Unit.  Assistant United States Attorneys Tara La Morte, Anden Chow, and Jessica Greenwood are in charge of the prosecution.

Rancher Sentenced for Running $244 Million “Ghost Cattle” Scam,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/rancher-sentenced-running-244-million-ghost-cattle-scam,"October 5, 2022",2022,"Rancher Sentenced for Running $244 Million “Ghost Cattle” Scam
A cattle rancher in Washington was sentenced yesterday to 11 years in prison for defrauding Tyson Foods Inc. (Tyson) and another company (Company 1) out of more than $244 million by charging the victim companies for the purported costs of purchasing and feeding hundreds of thousands of cattle that did not exist.
According to court documents, Cody Allen Easterday, 51, of Mesa, used his company, Easterday Ranches Inc., to enter into a series of agreements with Tyson and Company 1 under which Easterday Ranches agreed to purchase and feed cattle on behalf of Tyson and Company 1. Per the agreements, Tyson and Company 1 would advance Easterday Ranches the costs of buying and raising the cattle. Once the cattle were slaughtered and sold at market price, Easterday Ranches would repay the costs advanced – plus interest and certain other costs – retaining the difference as profit.
“The Criminal Division is committed to holding those who carry out fraudulent schemes accountable, especially those that are complex, long-running, and seriously affect our nation’s food industry and commodities market,” said Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Polite, Jr. of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division.
Between approximately 2016 and November 2020, Easterday submitted and caused others to submit false and fraudulent invoices and other information to Tyson and Company 1. These false and fraudulent invoices sought and obtained reimbursement from the victim companies for the purported costs of purchasing and raising hundreds of thousands of cattle that neither Easterday nor Easterday Ranches ever purchased, and that did not actually exist.
As a result of the fraud scheme, Tyson and Company 1 paid Easterday Ranches over $244 million for the purported costs of purchasing and feeding over 265,000 ghost cattle. Easterday used the fraud proceeds for his personal use and benefit, and for the benefit of Easterday Ranches, including to cover approximately $200 million in commodity futures contracts trading losses that Easterday had incurred on behalf of Easterday Ranches. In connection with his trading, Easterday also defrauded the CME Group Inc. (CME), which operates the world’s largest financial derivatives exchange, by submitting falsified paperwork, which resulted in the CME exempting Easterday Ranches from otherwise-applicable position limits in live cattle futures contracts.
“No one is above the law. Mr. Easterday amassed significant personal wealth, yet, he wanted more, so he defrauded his victims of nearly a quarter billion dollars by charging for cattle that never existed,” said U.S. Attorney Vanessa R. Waldref for the Eastern District of Washington. “But for the combined and incredible efforts of our law enforcement team, today’s sentence and the $244 million restitution award – one of the largest in our District’s history – would not have been possible. Fraud has a debilitating impact on society by draining our communities’ limited resources. Accordingly, we will continue to prosecute fraudsters to the fullest extent so we can keep our communities safe and strong in Washington State and throughout our great Nation.”
“Today’s sentence sends a strong message that individuals who commit fraud will be held accountable for the harm caused to banks, communities and the agricultural sector,” said Inspector General Jay N. Lerner of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of Inspector General (FDIC-OIG). “The FDIC Office of Inspector General remains committed to investigating cases of swindle and deception that undermine the integrity of financial institutions, and we will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to bring to justice those who commit such offenses.”
“Cody Easterday spent years engaged in an extensive false billing scheme that resulted in millions of dollars in losses for the victim which led to sizable personal benefits for himself,” said Inspector in Charge Eric Shen of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS) Criminal Investigations Group. “Today’s sentencing is proof that anyone who engages in deceptive practices like this will be held accountable for their actions. The Postal Inspection Service is proud to have partnered with the FDIC-OIG in this investigation.”
The FDIC-OIG and USPIS Criminal Investigations Group investigated the case.
Deputy Chief Avi Perry and Assistant Chief John “Fritz” Scanlon of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Brian M. Donovan and Russell E. Smoot for the Eastern District of Washington prosecuted the case.

Somerset County Woman Admits $1 Million Paycheck Protection Program and Economic Injury Disaster Loan Fraud Scheme,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/somerset-county-woman-admits-1-million-paycheck-protection,"September 26, 2022",2022,"NEWARK, N.J. – A Somerset County, New Jersey, woman today admitted fraudulently obtaining over $1 million in federal Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans and Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL), U.S. Attorney Philip R. Sellinger announced.
Nivah Garcis, 51, of North Plainfield, New Jersey, pleaded guilty before U.S. District Judge Peter G. Sheridan in Trenton federal court to an information charging her with one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud, three counts of wire fraud, and one count of money laundering.
According to documents filed in this case and statements made in court:
Garcis conspired with at least one individual to submit two fraudulent PPP loan applications to a lender on behalf of two purported businesses that she controlled, and further submitted three fraudulent EIDL loan applications to the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) on behalf of these businesses and another business that she owned. She then engaged in financial transactions with the loan proceeds, including for the purchase of property.
The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act is a federal law enacted on March 29, 2020, designed to provide emergency financial assistance to the millions of Americans suffering the economic effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. One source of relief provided by the CARES Act was the authorization of up to $349 billion in forgivable loans to small businesses for job retention and certain other expenses, through the PPP. In April 2020, Congress authorized over $300 billion in additional PPP funding.
The applications Garcis submitted each contained fraudulent representations to the lender, a Federal Home Loan Bank member, and the SBA, including bogus federal tax documents purportedly from the IRS. Garcis also fabricated the existence of employees and wages paid through the purported businesses. According to IRS records, however, none of the purported tax documents that Garcis submitted in support of her loan applications were ever in fact filed with the IRS. Based on Garcis’ misrepresentations, her loan applications for her purported businesses were approved for approximately $1.05 million in federal COVID-19 emergency relief funds meant for distressed small businesses. Garcis then used the proceeds to purchase property and for various personal expenses.
The count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud carries a maximum penalty of 30 years in prison and a $1 million fine. The counts of wire fraud each carry a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and a maximum fine of $250,000. The count of money laundering carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a maximum fine of $250,000. Sentencing is scheduled for Jan. 31, 2023.
U.S. Attorney Sellinger credited special agents of IRS – Criminal Investigation, under the direction of Acting Special Agent in Charge Tammy L Tomlins; special agents of the Social Security Administration, Office of the Inspector General, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Sharon MacDermott; special agents of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of New Jersey, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Thomas Mahoney; postal inspectors of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service in Newark, under the direction of Acting Inspector in Charge Raimundo Marrero, Philadelphia Division; special agents of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, Office of Inspector General, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Robert Manchak; special agents of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Office of Inspector General, under the direction of Acting Special Agent in Charge Stephen Donnelly; special agents of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation – Office of the Inspector General, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Patricia Tarasca in New York; and special agents of the Department of Homeland Security, Homeland Security Investigations, under the direction of Acting Special Agent in Charge Richard.

Beverly Hills Man Pleads Guilty to Charge for Using Fake Companies in Scheme to Steal Millions of Dollars in COVID Small Business Loans
LOS ANGELES – A Beverly Hills man – whose sons pleaded guilty earlier this month to felonies for defrauding COVID-relief programs – pleaded guilty today to a federal criminal charge for fraudulently seeking more than $6.7 million in COVID-related small business loans for more than half a dozen fake companies.
Ramiro Da Rosa Mendes, 61, pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud.
According to his plea agreement, from April 2020 to August 2020, Mendes schemed to fraudulently obtain federal disaster relief funds distributed through the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) and Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) programs that were intended to help small businesses through the economic shock of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Mendes claimed to own numerous fake businesses purportedly based in Beverly Hills, including One Wilshire Enterprises, Professional Music Services, and MB Property Management Group LLC. These companies were fake businesses that did not exist prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and did not have any operations or employees.
Mendes also claimed to be the owner of fake real estate services companies, including Ramiro Mendes Real Estate Services, Real Estate Services, and Real Estate Invesst-ments, also located in Beverly Hills and Massachusetts, as well as other businesses registered in Wyoming.
In his plea agreement, Mendes admitted to submitting 19 applications for PPP and EIDL loans that contained false and fraudulent information, including the purported existence of payroll expenses, phony tax forms, and the operational status of the businesses.
For example, on June 24, 2020, Mendes submitted a fraudulent PPP loan application to a Florida-based bank, seeking a loan of $975,100. The loan application falsely stated that One Wilshire Enterprises employed 18 people, had an average monthly payroll of $390,040, and, according to a false tax form, earned $4,810,149 in revenue in 2019. Based on this false information, the bank approved and funded a PPP loan in the amount of $793,300. The loan amount was wired into a bank account Mendes controlled.
Mendes admitted in his plea agreement to stealing the COVID-relief loans and misusing the proceeds for his own personal benefit, including the purchase of cryptocurrency. He further admitted that the intended loss in this case was approximately $6,708,963 and the actual loss was at least approximately $2,228,302.
United States District Judge Percy Anderson scheduled a December 12 sentencing hearing, at which time Mendes will face a statutory maximum sentence of 20 years in federal prison.
In related cases, Mendes’ sons – Ammon Jose de Pina Mendes, 26, of Beverly Hills, and Mateus Pina Mendes, 33, of Los Angeles – each pleaded guilty on September 1 to one count of wire fraud. Using the names of fake businesses, Ammon and Mateus Mendes fraudulently obtained approximately $222,225 and $143,283, respectively, in PPP and EIDL loans. Their sentencing hearings are scheduled for November 29, at which time each defendant will face up to 20 years in federal prison.
This matter was investigated by the FBI; the Federal Housing Finance Agency – Office of the Inspector General; the United States Postal Inspection Service; the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation – Office of the Inspector General; the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration – Office of the Inspector General; IRS Criminal Investigation; and the Small Business Administration – Office of the Inspector General.
Assistant United States Attorney Scott Paetty of the Major Frauds Section and Trial Attorney Jennifer Bilinkas of the Justice Department’s Fraud Section are prosecuting this case.

South Florida U.S. Attorney’s Office to Lead COVID-19 Fraud Strike Force Team Against Pandemic Relief Fraud
More Than 20 Cases Recently Charged
MIAMI – Recognized as a leader in pandemic relief fraud prosecutions, the Southern District of Florida’s U.S. Attorney’s Office has been selected to head one of three COVID-19 Fraud Strike Force Teams nationally. In recent weeks alone, the district has charged 23 COVID-19 relief fraud cases, with scheme amounts totaling over $150 million.
The Department of Justice established the Strike Force to enhance the department’s existing efforts to combat and prevent COVID-19 related fraud.
“Over the years, the South Florida U.S. Attorney’s Office and its law enforcement partners have developed robust domestic and international anti-fraud and money laundering practices,” said Juan Antonio Gonzalez, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida. “Our experience with these data-driven financial prosecutions allowed us to launch an early and aggressive attack on COVID-19 relief fraud by holding accountable those who tried to capitalize on an unprecedented crisis. We are proud to have been selected to lead one of three COVID-19 Fraud Strike Force Teams and look forward to continuing to advance this important Department of Justice effort.”
In total, the South Florida U.S. Attorney’s Office has charged over 80 cases since the CARES Act was passed.  It has seized over $23.5 million in stolen relief funds.  The Strike Force Team will build on this momentum.
“These Strike Force Teams will build on the Department’s historic enforcement efforts to deter, detect, and disrupt pandemic fraud wherever it occurs,” said Attorney General Merrick B. Garland. “Since the start of this pandemic, the Justice Department has seized over $1.2 billion in relief funds that criminals were attempting to steal and charged over 1,500 defendants with crimes in federal districts across the country, but our work is far from over. The Department will continue to work relentlessly to combat pandemic fraud and hold accountable those who perpetrate it.”
Anticipating the need to protect the integrity of these taxpayer funds and to otherwise protect South Floridians from financial fraud related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Southern District of Florida established multiple efforts to identify, investigate, and prosecute such fraud.  This multifaceted approach has proven invaluable in going after those who have cheated the system.
“The Strike Force Teams are the latest example of the Justice Department’s commitment to fight pandemic fraud,” said Associate Deputy Attorney General Kevin Chambers, who serves as the department’s director for COVID-19 Fraud Enforcement. “The work being done by our prosecutors, trial attorneys, agents and partners on our COVID-19 Fraud Enforcement Task Force has been extraordinary. We’re going a step further with the announcement of strike force teams to support, enhance, and continue the great work being done across the department.”
“Our investigations of schemes to defraud federal pandemic relief programs have continued and will continue even as the pandemic itself evolves,” said Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General Special Agent in Charge Kyle A. Myles. “The cases described in this announcement reflect collaboration with our law enforcement partners and specific progress made in the fight to identify, investigate, and prosecute financial crime affecting FDIC-insured institutions.”
The Southern District of Florida’s Strike Force Team will be comprised of dedicated prosecutors, working together with agents from Department of Labor Office of Inspector General, Small Business Administration Office of Inspector General,  Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General, Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General, FBI, U.S. Secret Service, Homeland Security Investigations, Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigations, U.S. Postal Inspection Service, Federal Reserve System Office of Inspector General, Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, and U.S. Coast Guard Investigative Service.  The Pandemic Response Accountability Committee and Special Inspector General for Pandemic Recovery will assist the Strike Force.
“OIG stands firm in the fight to hold persons that commit fraud responsible in collaboration with our law enforcement partners,” said SBA OIG’s Inspector General Hannibal M. Ware. “OIG remains committed to rooting out bad actors and protecting the integrity of SBA programs every day. I want to thank the U.S. Attorney’s Office and our law enforcement partners for their dedication and pursuit of justice.”
A group effort is needed to address this problem and that is exactly what these agencies and departments have committed to doing.
“This announcement is the culmination of hard work by numerous agencies,” said Wayne Rosen, Assistant Special Agent in Charge, Miami Regional Office, Office of Inspector General for the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection. “It sends a clear message that federal law enforcement is watching and will relentlessly pursue fraudsters and bring them to justice. We are proud to work with our law enforcement partners in this endeavor.”
Although these COVID-19 loan programs have ended, guilty parties should not get a false sense of security.  Their capture certainly remains a priority.
“The CARES Act provided vital funds to thousands of small businesses impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic economic downturn,” said Jason J. Carley, Assistant Special Agent in Charge, FBI Miami. “While those loan programs have ended, the FBI’s commitment to seeking out those who defrauded the government continues. Millions of taxpayer dollars earmarked for CARES Act programs were diverted away from the intended recipients by illegal activity. If you defrauded these programs, know that our investigators will continue to follow the money right to your doorstep.”
The actions of fraudsters have basically taken money from struggling people doing their best to endure the pandemic.
“These defendants are alleged to have defrauded a program intended to assist hardworking Americans who have been unfairly impacted as a result of this unprecedented and challenging health crisis,” said Special Agent in Charge (SAC) Anthony Salisbury, HSI Miami. “HSI remains committed to working with our law enforcement partners to bring every asset to bear against anyone who seeks to take advantage of the pandemic to deliberately harm and deceive others for their own profit.”
That fraudsters have taken advantage of a critical health situation only seems to bolster the efforts to take them down.
“It is very unfortunate that criminals have seized on the COVID-19 pandemic as a money-making opportunity and created fraudulent schemes to steal from federal programs designed to assist law-abiding Americans,” said Matthew D. Line, Special Agent in Charge, IRS-Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI), Miami Field Office. “We continue relentlessly committed to working with our law enforcement partners to aggressively pursue criminal investigations and hold crooks accountable for fraudulently profiting from CARES Act programs.”
“The allegations in these matters are very disturbing,” said J. Russell George, Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration. “Exploiting some of the most vulnerable people in our society will not be tolerated. The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration aggressively investigates abuse of the Federal tax system. We are committed to working with our law enforcement partners to ensure that those who endeavor to corrupt federal tax administration are prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”
As much success as the agencies pursuing this type of criminal activity have had, there still remains work to be done.
“An important mission of the U.S. Department of Labor, Office of Inspector General is to investigate allegations of fraud related to the unemployment insurance program,” said Mathew Broadhurst, Special Agent-in-Charge, Atlanta Region, U.S. Department of Labor, Office of Inspector General. “The DOL-OIG fully supports the Department of Justice’s COVID-19 Strike Force Team program. Through collaboration and leveraging of resources, the federal law enforcement community has made great strides in holding COVID-19 fraudsters accountable but there is more work to be done. We will continue to work closely with the U.S. Attorney’s Office and our strike team partners to safeguard unemployment compensation benefit programs for those who most need them.”
It is a team effort that everyone should take pride in.
“The DHS Office of Inspector General thanks the U.S. Department of Justice and our law enforcement partners for significant collaboration within the COVID-19 Fraud Strike Force,” said Dr. Joseph V. Cuffari, Inspector General of the Department of Homeland Security. DHS OIG will continue to investigate these crimes and to help ensure the integrity of DHS programs.”
Criminal enforcement in the Southern District of Florida to combat COVID-19/CARES Act-related financial fraud schemes have proceeded on numerous fronts, including:
RECENT PROSECUTIONS
In recent weeks, the district has charged 23 COVID-19 relief fraud cases, with scheme amounts totaling over $150 million. It is alleged that the defendants in these cases received over $35 million.
United States v. Hernandez, Case No. 22-mj-03333
The Southern District of Florida recently charged Daniel Hernandez, 50, a Market Manager for a top national bank, with orchestrating a $30 million COVID-19 relief fraud scheme.  According to the criminal complaint affidavit, Hernandez – who oversaw 80 bank employees and more than 20 branches throughout South Florida – recruited bank customers and at least one former bank employee to submit over 90 fraudulent PPP loan applications.  It is alleged that Hernandez advised the recruits on how to file the applications and what to include in them, then used his position at the bank to ensure the fraudulent loans were reviewed and, when possible, approved.  The applications sought over $30 million in fraud proceeds.  The investigation to date has identified over $15 million in fraudulent loans issued.
In addition to Hernandez, the Southern District has charged others with participating in the fraud.  Willian Alexander Posada Sandrea pled guilty and is scheduled to be sentenced on October 24, 2022 (22-cr-20194).
Armando De Leon, who worked at the bank with Hernandez, was charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud (22-20420-CR-KMM).  Javier Alfonso Barata (22-mj-3095), and Alvaro Enrique Castillo along with Douglas David Melean Socorro (22-mj-2928) have also been charged.
FDIC-OIG, FBI Miami, SBA-OIG, and the Florida Department of Revenue investigated this matter.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Eli S. Rubin of the Southern District of Florida is prosecuting the case, which charges Hernandez with conspiracy to commit bank fraud.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Joshua Paster is handling forfeiture.
United States v. Emile, Case No. 22-cr-60176
The Southern District recently charged Herbert Emile, 41, with participating in a $100 million COVID-19 relief fraud scheme. In 2019, the FDIC-OIG began investigating a group of individuals who were using shell companies, stolen personal identification information – including stolen social security numbers-- and synthetic identities to commit fraud against several federally-insured banks in the United States.
When the CARES Act was enacted in 2020, members of the conspiracy used their pre-established shell companies to steal millions of dollars from the Act’s programs.  In total, members of this conspiracy and their associates are responsible for stealing over $100 million from U.S. banks and PPP/CARES Act programs.
In addition to Emile, others were also charged in this district with participating in the fraud scheme.  These defendants have pled guilty: Hasan Hakim Brown, 46; Jean Renald Fleuridor, 42; Raul Mauricio Gonzalez, 48; and Lorin George Saunders, 40.
FDIC-OIG and the United States Secret Service investigated the case. SBA-OIG and FBI Miami assisted.

United States v. Philossaint Case No. 22-cr-08336
United States v. Tollinchi, 22-cr-08337
United States v. Shazier, et al., 22-cr-08357
In cases alleging PPP fraud, EIDL fraud, and loan forgiveness application fraud, a South Florida federal grand jury recently charged Joff Stenn Wroy Philossaint, 32, of Miramar, Florida; Mariel Tollinchi, 35, of Miramar, Florida; Maurice Shazier, 50, of Fort Pierce, Florida; David Andre Johnson, 52, of Lauderhill, Florida; Regine Marie Rene, 32, of Boynton Beach, Florida; and Brianna Monique Gayle, 23, of Riviera Beach, Florida, with conspiring to commit wire fraud and money laundering, as well as with aggravated identity theft.  Philossaint also was charged with obtaining U.S. citizenship through fraud.
It is alleged that Philossaint and Gayle, working through one of Philossaint’s businesses, worked with others to prepare PPP and EIDL loan applications, as well as loan forgiveness applications, on behalf of dozens of companies that falsely certified their number of employees, their revenue, and their business expenses.  As alleged, to support the EIDL and PPP loan applications, and the PPP loan forgiveness applications, the defendants prepared and submitted fake IRS documents and created payroll accounts with a national payroll processing company using stolen identities to make it appear that the companies had paid wages, which they never did.
According to the allegations, Philossaint charged a kickback of 10 percent of the funded loans and required others to disguise the kickback payments by splitting them into smaller amounts and writing “advertising” on the memo lines of the checks.
It is alleged that Philossaint and his fiancée, Tollinchi, directly received PPP and EIDL loans of nearly $500,000, in addition to kickback payments; Shazier received PPP and EIDL loans totaling $873,328; Johnson received PPP and EIDL loans totaling $443,792; and Rene received PPP and EIDL loans totaling $183,906.  It is also alleged that the 26 companies for which Philossaint and Gayle set up payroll processing received at least 33 PPP and EIDL loans totaling more than $4.8 million.

Chief Credit Officer Admits to Conspiracy to Defraud First NBC Bank,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/chief-credit-officer-admits-conspiracy-defraud-first-nbc-bank,"September 13, 2022",2022,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Chief Credit Officer Admits to Conspiracy to Defraud First NBC Bank
NEW ORLEANS – United States Attorney Duane A. Evans announced that WILLIAM J. BURNELL (“BURNELL”) , age 72, a resident of Kenner, Louisiana, pleaded guilty today to conspiracy to defraud First NBC Bank (“ Bank “), the New Orleans-based bank that failed in April 2017.
According to court documents, from in or around 2006 through April 2017, BURNELL was the Bank’s Chief Credit Officer. He was responsible for the overall quality of the Bank’s lending function; the Bank’s credit policies and administration; the Bank’s loan recovery and collection efforts; and the Bank’s monitoring and managing of past due loans, including the approval of the Bank’s internal list of past-due loans. BURNELL was responsible for compiling month-end reports, including lists of overdrawn borrowers and past-due loans. These reports should have accurately shown the quality of the Bank’s assets, which included loans. Misrepresentations on these reports made a true assessment of the Bank’s overall financial well-being impossible. BURNELL was also responsible for approving credit risk ratings before the Bank decided to lend to its customers.
Other people involved with the Bank, including the Bank’s board of directors, external auditors, and federal and state regulators, relied on BURNELL as the Chief Credit Officer to inform them about problems with the Bank’s asset quality, including problems with loans. Nevertheless, BURNELL conspired with the Bank’s President Ashton J. Ryan, Jr., Executive Vice President Robert B. Calloway, Senior Vice President Fred V. Beebe, and others to conceal material information and defraud the Bank. For example, BURNELL , Ryan, and Calloway knowingly concealed material information about borrower Gary Gibbs from the board, auditors, and examiners. Further, BURNELL served as an additional approving officer for loans to borrower Warren Treme, who was Ryan’s business partner. Beebe was Treme’s loan officer. BURNELL , Ryan, and Beebe made misrepresentations in Treme’s loan documents and to the board, auditors, and examiners, in ways that financially benefited Ryan. Calloway, Gibbs, and Treme have all previously pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud the Bank, as have the Bank’s General Counsel Gregory St. Angelo, borrower Kenneth Charity, borrower Jeffrey Dunlap, and borrower Arvind Vira. The trial for Ryan, Beebe, and borrower Frank Adolph is scheduled to begin on January 3, 2023.
“Today’s guilty plea once again demonstrates that  the FDIC OIG and our law enforcement partners from the United States Attorney’s Office, Eastern District of Louisiana; Federal Bureau of Investigation; and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Office of Inspector General will continue to investigate those individuals, including bank directors and officers who are entrusted to manage financial institutions, but cause harm to our nation’s banking industry,” said Anand Ramlall, Special Agent in Charge, Dallas Region, Office of Inspector General for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
“Today’s plea agreement illustrates the FBI’s steadfast commitment to bringing those who commit white collar crimes to justice, like Mr. William J. Burnell,” said Douglas A. Williams, Jr., Special Agent in Charge, FBI New Orleans. “We thank our partners from the United States Attorney’s Office, Eastern District of Louisiana; Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of Inspector General; and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Office of Inspector General for their strong partnerships in protecting the integrity of the American banking system.”
“Today’s plea sends a clear message that bank executives who commit fraud and deliberately deceive regulators will be brought to justice for their actions. I commend our agent and their federal law enforcement partners for their hard work and persistence, which ultimately led to this outcome,” said Stephen Donnelly, Acting Special Agent in Charge, Eastern Region, Office of Inspector General for the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection.
BURNELL has pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Sections 1344 and 1349. The maximum penalties that may be imposed upon conviction are thirty years in prison; a fine of up to $1,000,000, or the greater of twice the gain to BURNELL or twice the loss to any victim; up to five years of supervised release; and a $100 mandatory special assessment fee .
Judge Eldon E. Fallon scheduled BURNELL ’s sentencing for March 16, 2023, at 2:00pm.
This case is being investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation; the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of Inspector General; and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Office of Inspector General. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Matthew R. Payne, Nicholas D. Moses, J. Ryan McLaren, and Rachal Cassagne are in charge of the prosecution.

Two Individuals Convicted of Conspiracy and Fraud in Cattle Ponzi Scheme
A federal jury convicted a woman and man today of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering relating to a scheme that fraudulently raised money from investors across the country.
According to court documents and evidence presented at trial, Reva Joyce Stachniw, 70, of Galesburg, Illinois, and Ron Throgmartin, 58, of Buford, Georgia, ran a Ponzi scheme from late 2017 until early 2019 by fraudulently representing to victim-investors that their investments were backed by short-term investments in cattle. They also used false and fraudulent pretenses to solicit money from victim-investors for the conspirators’ Colorado-based marijuana business, Universal Herbs LLC. Other victim-investors gave the conspirators money based on false promises that investment money would be used for legitimate business activities related to cattle or marijuana, without having the investment money linked to specific investment opportunities.
Stachniw and Throgmartin were convicted on one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, five counts of wire fraud, and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. The defendants are scheduled to be sentenced on Jan. 6, 2023, and face a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison on each of the wire fraud counts and the conspiracy to commit wire fraud count, as well as 10 years in prison on the conspiracy to commit money laundering count.

Florida Man to Plead Guilty to $2.5 Million COVID-Relief Fraud
BOSTON – A former Massachusetts resident has been charged and has agreed to plead guilty to filing fraudulent applications to obtain $2.5 million in Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan funds made available under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act.
Vinicius Santana, 34, of Boca Raton, Fla. and formerly of Revere, was charged with one count of wire fraud and one count of unlawful monetary transactions. A plea hearing has not yet been scheduled by the Court. Santana was previously arrested and charged by criminal complaint with the single wire fraud offense in June 2022.
According to the charging document, Santana owned Complete Home Care, LLC (CHC), a painting company in Massachusetts. In April 2020, Santana submitted four different PPP loan applications on behalf of CHC. The first three applications, in which Santana allegedly listed five employees and an average monthly payroll of between $10,000 and $18,000, were denied. In the fourth application for CHC, it is alleged that Santana falsely claimed to have 154 employees and an average monthly payroll of $1 million. On May 11, 2020, a bank issued Santana’s company a $2,500,000 loan based on the allegedly false representations in the fourth application.
After receiving the funds, it is alleged that Santana misused the loan proceeds to buy real estate and cars and to invest in cryptocurrency.
The CARES Act is a federal law enacted on March 29, 2020, designed to provide emergency financial assistance to the millions of Americans who are suffering the economic effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. One source of relief provided by the CARES Act was the authorization of forgivable loans to small businesses for job retention and certain approved expenses, through the PPP.
The charge of wire fraud provides for a sentence of up to 20 years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of $250,000, or twice the gross gain or loss from the scheme, whichever is greater. The charge of unlawful monetary transactions provides for a sentence of up to 10 years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of the greater of either $250,000 or twice the value of the criminally derived property. Sentences are imposed by a federal district court judge based upon the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and statutes which govern the determination of a sentence in a criminal case.

Bank Executive Vice President Admits to Conspiracy to Defraud First NBC Bank,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/bank-executive-vice-president-admits-conspiracy-defraud-first,"August 2, 2022",2022,"NEW ORLEANS – United States Attorney Duane A. Evans announced that ROBERT B. CALLOWAY , age 62, of Metairie, Louisiana, pleaded guilty today to conspiracy to defraud First NBC Bank, the New Orleans-based bank that failed in April 2017. CALLOWAY served as Executive Vice President of the bank.
According to court documents, CALLOWAY and other bank officers, including Bank President Ashton Ryan Jr. and Chief Credit Officer William Burnell, conspired together to conceal the financial condition of bank borrower Gary R. Gibbs from the First NBC Bank Board of Directors, auditors, and examiners. They falsely stated in loan documents that Gibbs was able to pay his loans with cash generated by his businesses, and they hid from the First NBC Bank Board of Directors, auditors, and examiners that Gibbs was only making his existing loan payments by getting new loans from First NBC Bank.  Ryan, Burnell, and CALLOWAY also concealed the fact that they made loans to Gibbs to keep him and his companies off of month-end reports that went to the Board, auditors, and examiners. These month-end reports listed borrowers who were not paying their loans or whose accounts were overdrawn. By keeping Gibbs and his entities off of those reports, Ryan, Burnell, and CALLOWAY were able to conceal their scheme and thereby allowing them to continue lending to Gibbs despite his inability to pay his loans. CALLOWAY also completed loan review forms that were sent to external auditors in which CALLOWAY omitted material information about Gibbs and his inability to pay his loans.
CALLOWAY pleaded guilty to a superseding bill of information charging him with one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Sections 1344 and 371.  The maximum penalty that may be imposed at sentencing for this charge is up to five years in prison; a fine of up to $250,000.00 or the greater of twice the gain to CALLOWAY or twice the loss to any victim; and up to three years of supervised release. U.S. District Judge Eldon E. Fallon set CALLOWAY ’s sentencing for March 16, 2023.
CALLOWAY had been previously charged in this case with codefendants Ashton Ryan, Jr., William J. Burnell, First NBC Bank Senior Vice President Fred V. Beebe, and bank borrower Frank J. Adolph. Ryan, Burnell, Beebe, and Adolph are scheduled for trial before Judge Fallon on January 3, 2023. Gibbs pleaded guilty in August 2020 to a bill of information charging him with conspiracy to commit bank fraud.

Brockton Man Charged with Fraudulently Obtaining Over $1.5 Million in COVID-Relief Funds
BOSTON – A Brockton man was charged on July 21, 2022 in connection with a scheme to submit false applications to obtain Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) and Economic Injury Disaster Loan Program (EIDL) funds through the Small Business Administration (SBA) which were made available under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.
Joao Mendes, 59, was charged and has agreed to plead guilty to one count of wire fraud. A plea hearing has not yet been scheduled by the Court.
According to the charging documents, beginning in or around June 2020 and continuing until at least in or around September 2020, Mendes submitted or caused to be submitted multiple fraudulent PPP and EIDL loan applications on behalf of various entities. The fraudulent PPP loan applications misrepresented the number of employees and the average monthly payroll expenses of Mendes’s various businesses. Mendes also allegedly submitted false tax records in support of his loan applications. In his EIDL applications, Mendes allegedly misrepresented the number of employees, gross revenues and costs of goods sold for each business. Based on the fraudulent applications, Mendes and others received over $1.5 million in PPP and EIDL funds. Once Mendes received the funds, he either spent them for his own personal benefit—including for the purchase of cryptocurrency—or transferred the funds into other accounts he controlled or to other individuals.
The CARES Act is a federal law enacted on March 29, 2020, designed to provide emergency financial assistance to the millions of Americans who are suffering the economic effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. One source of relief provided by the CARES Act was the authorization of forgivable loans to small businesses for job retention and certain approved expenses, through the PPP. Another is the EIDL, through which the SBA offers loans that can only be used on certain permissible business expenses, which can include payment of fixed business debts, payroll, accounts payable, and other business-related expenses that could have been paid had the COVID-19 disaster not occurred. The American Rescue Plan Act established the RRF to provide funding to help restaurants and other eligible businesses keep their doors open through forgivable loans for eligible uses.
The charge of wire fraud provides for a sentence of up to 20 years in prison, up to three years of supervised release and a fine of up to $250,000 or twice the gross gain or loss from the offense. The charge of making a false statements to a financial institution provides for a sentence of up to 30 years in prison, up to three years of supervised release and a fine of up to $250,000 or twice the gross gain or loss from the offense. Sentences are imposed by a federal district court judge based upon the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and statutes which govern the determination of a sentence in a criminal case.

Florida Man Charged with $1.6 Million Cares Act Loan Fraud Scheme
NEWARK, N.J. – A Florida man will make his initial court appearance today on charges related to his role in a scheme to fraudulently obtain over $1.6 million in federal Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans and Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) payments, U.S. Attorney Philip R. Sellinger announced.
Mohamed A. Awad, 60, of Ocala, Florida, is charged by complaint with two counts of wire fraud. He was arrested July 21, 2022, in Virginia and made his initial appearance this afternoon before U.S. Magistrate Judge William E. Fitzpatrick in the Eastern District of Virginia. He was detained pending transfer to the District of New Jersey.
According to documents filed in this case and statements made in court:
The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act is a federal law enacted on March 29, 2020, designed to provide emergency financial assistance to millions of Americans suffering the economic effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. One source of relief provided by the CARES Act was the authorization of up to $349 billion in forgivable loans to small businesses for job retention and certain other expenses, through the PPP. The PPP allowed qualifying small businesses and other organizations to receive loans with a maturity of two years and an interest rate of 1 percent. PPP loan proceeds must be used by businesses on payroll costs, interest on mortgages, rent, and utilities.
The CARES Act also authorized the U.S. Small Business Association to provide EIDLs of up to $2 million, through the Economic Injury Disaster Loan Program, to eligible small businesses experiencing substantial financial disruption due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Awad engaged in a scheme to illegally obtain over $1.6 million in PPP and EIDL loans through numerous misrepresentations to lenders. He submitted fraudulent loan applications that fabricated numbers of employees and misrepresented company information, to induce PPP and EIDL lenders to approve the loan applications that they otherwise would not have approved.  Awad submitted falsified tax documents in support of PPP applications. According to IRS records, none of the purported tax documents that Awad submitted were ever in fact filed with the IRS. Awad transferred the loan proceeds among various bank accounts he controlled, withdrawing significant amounts in cash and transferring at least approximately $760,000 out of the country via wire transfers to banks based in Egypt.
The charges each carry a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and a maximum fine of $250,000 or twice the gross gain to the defendant or gross loss to the victim, whichever is greatest.
U.S. Attorney Sellinger credited special agents of the IRS-Criminal Investigation, under the direction of Acting Special Agent in Charge Tammy Tomlins; postal inspectors of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service in Newark, under the direction of Inspector in Charge Damon Wood, Philadelphia Division; special agents of the FBI, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge James E.

California Man Sentenced to Over 11 Years for $27 Million PPP Fraud Scheme,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/california-man-sentenced-over-11-years-27-million-ppp-fraud,"July 19, 2022",2022,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

California Man Sentenced to Over 11 Years for $27 Million PPP Fraud Scheme
A Southern California man was sentenced today to 135 months, the equivalent of 11 years and three months, in prison for submitting fraudulent applications seeking money from the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), submitting false statements to a financial institution, and money laundering.
Robert Benlevi, 53, of Encino, was convicted by a federal jury of bank fraud, making false statements to a financial institution, and money laundering on March 28. According to court documents, and evidence presented at trial, Benlevi submitted 27 PPP loan applications to four banks between April and June 2020 on behalf of eight companies solely owned by Benlevi. In the applications, Benlevi sought a total of $27 million in forgivable PPP loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (SBA) under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. In his fraudulent applications, Benlevi represented that each of his companies had 100 employees and average monthly payroll of $400,000, even though he knew that the companies did not have any employees or payroll expenses.
The evidence further showed that Benlevi also submitted fabricated IRS documents falsely stating that each of the companies had an annual payroll of $4.8 million. Based on Benlevi’s fraudulent loan applications, three of Benlevi’s companies — 1Stellar Health LLC, Bestways2 Health LLC, and Joyous-Health4U LLC — obtained $3 million in PPP funds. Although Benlevi falsely represented that the funds sought through the PPP loan applications would be used for payroll and certain other business expenses, the evidence showed that he instead used them for personal expenses, including cash withdrawals, payments on his personal credit cards, transfers to other personal and business accounts he controlled, and renting an oceanfront apartment in Santa Monica.
Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Polite, Jr. of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division; Acting U.S. Attorney Stephanie S. Christensen for the Central District of California; Assistant Director Luis Quesada of the FBI’s Criminal Investigative Division; Acting Assistant Director in Charge Amir Ehsaei of the FBI’s Los Angeles Field Office; Special Agent in Charge Jeffrey D. Pittano of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC-OIG); and Special Agent in Charge Weston King of the SBA Office of Inspector General (SBA-OIG) Western Region made the announcement.

Camden County Man Admits Defrauding COVID-19 Relief Programs and Illegally Possessing Firearm
CAMDEN, N.J. – A Camden County, New Jersey, man today admitted conspiring to fraudulently obtain COVID-19 relief funds, fraudulently obtaining unemployment benefits, and illegally possessing a firearm, U.S. Attorney Philip R. Sellinger announced.
Stephen Bennett, 46, of Berlin, New Jersey, pleaded guilty before U.S. District Judge Karen M. Williams in Camden federal court to an information charging him with one count of bank fraud conspiracy, one count of wire fraud, and one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm.
According to documents filed in this case and statements made in court:
The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act is a federal law enacted in March 2020 and was designed to provide emergency financial assistance to the millions of Americans who are suffering the economic effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. One source of relief provided by the CARES Act was the authorization of hundreds of billions of dollars in forgivable loans to small businesses for job retention and certain other expenses, through a program referred to as the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP).  The CARES Act also authorized the Small Business Administration to provide Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDLs) of up to $2 million to eligible small businesses that were experiencing substantial financial disruption due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
To obtain a PPP or EIDL loan, a qualifying small business was required to apply and provide information on its operations, including the number of employees and expenses. In addition, businesses generally had to provide supporting documentation.
The CARES Act also created a new temporary federal unemployment insurance program called Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA), which provided unemployment insurance benefits for individuals who were not eligible for other types of unemployment (the self-employed, independent contractors, gig economy workers). The CARES Act also created a new temporary federal program called Federal Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (FPUC) that provided an additional $600 weekly benefit to those eligible for PUA and regular unemployment insurance benefits.
In 2020, Bennett conspired with Rhonda Thomas to submit one PPP application and one EIDL application for a company controlled by Bennett. The applications stated that the company had 16 employees, gross revenues of $1.73 million, and an average monthly payroll of $144,000, when in fact the company had no employees, revenue, or payroll. Bennett and Thomas also submitted forged tax forms and altered bank statements as part of the PPP loan application.  Based on the misrepresentations, the loans were approved in the amount of $510,000. Bennett paid kickbacks of over $150,000 to Thomas and used the rest of the fraudulently obtained PPP and EIDL loan proceeds to pay for personal expenses, including jewelry and vehicles.
Also in 2020, Bennett defrauded the Pennsylvania Department of Labor by submitting 74 unemployment insurance claims in the names of other individuals. Bennett falsely stated on that the applicants were self-employed and unemployed because of COVID-19. Benefits of $425,339 were paid to Bennett as a result of the fraudulent claims he submitted.
In May 2021, law enforcement officials executing a search warrant at Bennett’s home found a .9 millimeter semiautomatic pistol with no serial number (commonly referred to as a “ghost gun”) and a magazine loaded with 16 rounds of ammunition.
The charge of bank fraud conspiracy carries a maximum penalty of 30 years in prison and a fine of $1 million. The count of wire fraud is punishable by a maximum of 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine, or twice the gross gain or loss from the offense. The count of being a felon in possession of a firearm carries a maximum of 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.  Sentencing is scheduled for Nov. 21, 2022.
Thomas previously pleaded guilty to bank fraud conspiracy and money laundering and is awaiting sentencing.
U.S. Attorney Sellinger credited special agents of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation – Office of the Inspector General, under the direction of Patricia Tarasca, Special Agent-in-Charge, New York Regional Office; special agents of the Social Security Administration, Office of Inspector General, New York Field Division, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Sharon MacDermott; special agents of the FBI’s South Jersey Resident Agency, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Jacqueline Maguire in Philadelphia, special agents of the U.S. Department of Labor, Office of the Inspector General, New York Region, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Jonathan Mellone, with the investigation leading to today’s guilty plea.
The government is represented by Assistant U.S. Attorney Daniel A. Friedman of the U.S. Attorney’s Office’s Criminal Division in Camden and Senior Litigation Counsel Jason M. Richardson of the U.S. Attorney’s Office Civil Rights Division in Camden.

Brother-Sister Duo Indicted for Laundering More Than $42 Million of Drug Proceeds Through 22 Shell Corporations,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/brother-sister-duo-indicted-laundering-more-42-million-drug,"July 7, 2022",2022,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Brother-Sister Duo Indicted for Laundering More Than $42 Million of Drug Proceeds Through 22 Shell Corporations
SAN DIEGO—Today Jesus Vazquez Padilla and his sister Monica Vazquez were indicted for laundering more than $42 million of drug trafficking proceeds through the financial system in the United States.
Special Agents from the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) led the investigation into hundreds of financial transactions by the sibling duo between 2015 and 2019.  Using approximately 85 United States bank accounts belonging to at least 22 California-based ‘shell’ corporations, Padilla and Vazquez deposited cash proceeds of drug sales into U.S.-based bank accounts and layered those deposits across multiple corporate accounts before finally transferring the funds to accounts in Mexican-based financial institutions.
For example, the indictment alleges that Defendants served as corporate officers for two San Diego-based corporations, OSVA Incorporated and Jeva International, Inc..  As corporate officers, they opened corporate bank accounts in U.S.-based financial institutions and, on various dates in 2017, deposited large cash amounts before finally transferring those funds to Mexico.
In total, the indictment contends that the siblings laundered $42,276,668, transferred approximately 95% of those funds to Mexico, and retained the remainder as payment for their services.
“Jesus Vazquez Padilla and his sister Monica Vazquez are charged with directing millions of dollars in drug trafficking proceeds through U.S. Banks and into the hands of drug trafficking organizations,” said U.S. Attorney Randy S. Grossman.  “Today’s indictment shows that the United States will prosecute not only those who traffic in drugs but also those who enable drug traffickers through sophisticated shell corporations, false tax returns, and multiple bank accounts.” Grossman praised the prosecutors and agents from IRS Criminal Investigation, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC OIG), and the San Diego Police Department for their diligent work on this case.
“Today’s indictment of the sibling defendants demonstrates our commitment to disrupting professional enablers who corrupt the U.S. financial system to launder the proceeds of deadly and illegal drugs,” said IRS Criminal Investigation Special Agent in Charge Ryan L. Korner of the Los Angeles Field Office. “The defendants not only created fake businesses to move drug money offshore, but also attempted to legitimize their scheme by filing false tax returns. IRS Criminal Investigation is proud to lead the Financial Investigations and Border Crimes Task Force and work with our law enforcement partners on this international money laundering investigation.”
“The allegations described in the indictment demonstrate criminal behavior designed to use our nation’s financial system against us,” said Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General Special Agent in Charge Jeffrey D. Pittano. “FDIC OIG will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to investigate allegations of laundering and other significant crimes impacting our nation’s financial institutions.”
“The San Diego Police Department is proud of its contributions to this federal task force,” said Chief David Nisleit. “These types of partnerships enable law enforcement to better address organized crime.”
This case is the result of ongoing efforts by the Financial Investigations and Border Crimes Task Force, a partnership targeting unlawful transactions through the financial system. The task force brings together the combined expertise of federal, state, and local law enforcement.

Woodford County Man Sentenced to 42 Months for Fraudulently Obtaining COVID Relief Loans
LEXINGTON, Ky. – A Versailles, Ky., man, Randall “Rocky” Blankenship, Jr., 49, was sentenced to 42 months in federal prison on Thursday, by U.S. District Judge Karen C. Caldwell, after pleading guilty to a conspiracy to commit wire fraud to obtain Paycheck Protection Program loans under false pretenses.
According to his plea agreement, in April 2020, Blankenship submitted four fraudulent applications for Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans for Blankenship RV Finance Solutions LLC, RSGG Properties LLC, RSGG Holdings LLC, and RSGG Investments LLC, all business entities he formed.  The Paycheck Protection Program was created as part of the CARES Act, a law passed in March 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Paycheck Protection Program loans were designed to provide an incentive for small businesses to keep workers on their payroll during the pandemic; these loans would be forgiven by the United States Small Business Administration, if the borrower established that loan proceeds were used for payroll, rent, or other approved business expenses.  The amount of the loan was dependent on the business’s payroll.
As part of his fraudulent PPP loan applications, Blankenship, with the assistance of an accountant, created fake tax documents and payroll records indicating that his businesses had hundreds of thousands of dollars in quarterly payroll; when in fact, none of the entities had any payroll expense at all.  Blankenship submitted the applications through Kentucky Bank and Independence Bank; and as a result, he obtained fraudulent PPP loans totaling $1,323,829.  According to his plea, he used some of the funds for a RV business he owned (which had already received its own PPP loan and was ineligible for additional loans at the time), as well as personal use, including paying off casino debt and purchasing real estate.  Blankenship has repaid the stolen funds in full.
In a related case before Judge Caldwell, the accountant, Tammy Jo Goodwin, also pled guilty to conspiring with Blankenship to fraudulently obtain PPP loans.  Goodwin’s sentencing is scheduled for September 26, 2022.
Under federal law, Blankenship must serve at least 85 percent of his prison sentence.  Upon his release from prison, he will be under the supervision of the U.S. Probation Office for three years.  In addition to the term of imprisonment, Blankenship was ordered to pay a $30,000 fine.
Carlton S. Shier, IV, United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Kentucky; Jodi Cohen, Special Agent in Charge, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Louisville Field Office; Kathy Enstrom, Special Agent in Charge, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of Inspector General (FDIC-OIG); and Stephen Donnelly, Acting Special Agent in Charge, Eastern Region, Office of Inspector General for the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (FRB), jointly announced the sentence.  The investigation was conducted by the FBI, FDIC-OIG, and FRB.  The United States was represented by Assistant U.S. Attorney Paul McCaffrey.
On May 17, 2021, the Attorney General established the COVID-19 Fraud Enforcement Task Force to marshal the resources of the Department of Justice in partnership with agencies across government to enhance efforts to combat and prevent pandemic-related fraud. The Task Force bolsters efforts to investigate and prosecute the most culpable domestic and international criminal actors and assists agencies tasked with administering relief programs to prevent fraud by, among other methods, augmenting and incorporating existing coordination mechanisms, identifying resources and techniques to uncover fraudulent actors and their schemes, and sharing and harnessing information and insights gained from prior enforcement efforts.

Chicago Attorney Sentenced to Federal Prison on False Statement and Tax Offenses in Connection with Funds Received from Failed Bank,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/chicago-attorney-sentenced-federal-prison-false-statement-and,"July 6, 2022",2022,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Chicago Attorney Sentenced to Federal Prison on False Statement and Tax Offenses in Connection with Funds Received from Failed Bank
CHICAGO — A federal judge today sentenced a Chicago attorney to four months in prison for false statement and tax offenses in connection with funds he received from the failed Washington Federal Bank for Savings.
PATRICK D. THOMPSON, 52, of Chicago, was convicted in February on all seven counts against him, including five counts of willfully filing a false income tax return and two counts of knowingly making a false statement to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.  U.S. District Judge Franklin U. Valderrama imposed the sentence after a hearing in federal court in Chicago.
The sentence was announced by John R. Lausch, Jr., United States Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois; Kathy Enstrom, Special Agent-in-Charge of the FDIC’s Office of Inspector General, Chicago Regional Office; Justin Campbell, Special Agent-in-Charge of IRS Criminal Investigation in Chicago; Emmerson Buie, Jr., Special Agent-in-Charge of the Chicago Field Office of the FBI; Catherine Huber, Special Agent-in-Charge of the Central Region of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, Office of Inspector General; Sally Luttrell, Assistant Inspector for Investigations of the Department of the Treasury, Office of Inspector General; and Kathryn B. Richards, Chicago Housing Authority Inspector General.  Valuable assistance was provided by the City of Chicago Inspector General’s Office.  The government was represented by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Michelle Petersen, Brian Netols, and Jeremy Daniel.
According to evidence presented at trial, Thompson from 2011 to 2014 received $219,000 from Chicago-based Washington Federal via a purported loan and other unsecured payments.  He made one re-payment on the loan but then stopped making payments, and he failed to pay interest on the funds he received.  Washington Federal was shut down in 2017 after the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency determined it was insolvent and had at least $66 million in nonperforming loans.  When the FDIC, as successor in interest to Washington Federal, attempted to obtain repayment from Thompson in 2018, he falsely stated that he owed only $110,000 and that those funds were for home improvement.  In reality, Thompson knew he had actually received $219,000 in three separate installments – none of which went towards home improvements – and that $110,000 of it was paid by the bank directly to Thompson’s law firm as Thompson’s capital contribution to the firm.
The tax charges stemmed from Thompson falsely representing on five years of income taxes that he was entitled to a mortgage interest deduction for interest payments made on money he received from Washington Federal, even though he knew the loan was not a mortgage loan and he did not make interest payments as reported on those returns.

The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act is a federal law enacted in March 2020 and was designed to provide emergency financial assistance to the millions of Americans who are suffering the economic effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. One source of relief provided by the CARES Act was the authorization of hundreds of billions of dollars in forgivable loans to small businesses for job retention and certain other expenses, through the PPP. The CARES Act also authorized the Small Business Administration to provide EIDL of up to $2 million to eligible small businesses that were experiencing substantial financial disruption due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
To obtain a PPP or EIDL loan, a qualifying small business was required to apply and provide information on its operations, including the number of employees and expenses. In addition, businesses generally had to provide supporting documentation.
In 2020 and 2021, Thomas submitted at least 10 PPP application and three EIDL applications for companies she controlled. She represented to the lenders that her companies had employees and payroll expenses that they did not have. In fact, many of her companies were nominal businesses with no employees or payroll expenses.
Thomas also conspired with other purported business owners to submit at least 20 fraudulent PPP and EIDL loan applications. She prepared and submitted these loan applications, which falsely stated the number of employees, payroll, and expenses of the businesses.
Thomas forged tax forms and altered bank statements that she submitted to the lenders as part of the loan applications.
Based on Thomas’s misrepresentations, lenders approved approximately 30 PPP and EIDL loans and disbursed more than $3.1 million in federal COVID-19 emergency relief funds meant for distressed small businesses to Thomas and her conspirators. Thomas personally received more than $330,000 from lenders based on the fraudulent loan applications for her companies and received kickbacks of more than $700,000 from other business owners for her role in preparing and submitting fraudulent loan applications.
Thomas used the fraudulently obtained PPP and EIDL loan proceeds to pay for personal expenses. In March 2022, Thomas withdrew approximately $60,000 of the loan proceeds in cash at a credit union in Camden County.
The charge of bank fraud conspiracy carries a maximum penalty of 30 years in prison and a fine of $1 million. The count of money laundering is punishable by a maximum of 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine, or twice the gross gain or loss from the offense, whichever is greatest. As part of her guilty plea, Thomas agreed to make restitution in the full amounts of the PPP and EIDL loans. Sentencing is scheduled for Nov. 1, 2022.

Camden County Woman Admits Fraudulently Obtaining 30 Loans Meant to Help Small Businesses During COVID-19 Pandemic
CAMDEN, N.J. – A Camden County, New Jersey, resident today admitted conspiring to fraudulently obtain 30 Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans and Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL) totaling more than $3 million, and to laundering the proceeds, U.S. Attorney Philip R. Sellinger announced.

DC Solar Owner Sentenced to Over 11 Years in Prison for Billion Dollar Ponzi Scheme,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/dc-solar-owner-sentenced-over-11-years-prison-billion-dollar,"June 28, 2022",2022,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

DC Solar Owner Sentenced to Over 11 Years in Prison for Billion Dollar Ponzi Scheme
SACRAMENTO, Calif. — U.S. District Judge John A. Mendez sentenced Paulette Carpoff, 51, of Martinez, to 11 years and three months in prison for her role in the biggest criminal fraud scheme in the history of the Eastern District of California, U.S. Attorney Phillip A. Talbert announced.
On Nov. 9, 2021, Paulette Carpoff pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit an offense against the United States and money laundering. According to court documents, Carpoff played a key role in the fraud as Chief Operating Officer of DC Solar and the owner and operator of its so-called distribution arm.
Between 2011 and 2018, DC Solar manufactured mobile solar generators (MSG) that were mounted on trailers. The company touted the versatility and environmental sustainability of the mobile solar generators and claimed that they were used to provide emergency power to cellphone towers and lighting at sporting and other events. A significant incentive for investors were generous federal tax credits due to the solar nature of the MSGs. Investors would buy the MSGs without ever taking possession of them, paying a percentage of the sales price and financing the balance with DC Solar. Then the investors leased the MSGs back to DC Solar, which in turn purported to lease them to third parties. A portion of the lease revenue was supposed to go to the investors and a portion would be used to pay the investors’ debts to DC Solar.
But in fact, when the third‑party leases generated little income, the company paid early investors with funds contributed by later investors, and DC Solar became a Ponzi-like scheme. They sold solar generators that did not exist to investors, making it appear that solar generators existed in locations that they did not, creating false financial statements, and obtaining false lease contracts, among other efforts to conceal the fraud.
In reality, at least half of the approximately 17,000 solar generators claimed to have been manufactured by DC Solar did not exist. Contrary to what investors were told, approximately 94% of the revenue claimed by DC Solar Distribution from supposed third-party leasing actually came instead from transfers of new investor cash.
Paulette Carpoff controlled the Ponzi-like payments that hid the company’s lack of third-party lease revenue, caused fake engineering reports for MSGs that the company sold but never built, and helped fool investors into thinking that DC Solar was a success. Eventually, DC Solar simply stopped building the mobile-solar generators that it claimed to be selling to investors.
While carrying out the fraud, Carpoff and her husband enjoyed an excessive accumulation of wealth that included luxury real estate in Lake Tahoe, Las Vegas, the Caribbean, and Cabo San Lucas, over 150 luxury and collector vehicles, a private subscription jet service, and lavish jewelry. When search warrants were executed in this case in December 2018, law enforcement found over $18,000 cash in Carpoff’s purse, another over $18,000 cash in the master bedroom, over $22,000 cash in a safe in the master bedroom closet, and over $9,000 cash in the Carpoffs’ vehicles parked at their residence.
“ Paulette Carpoff played an integral part in a massive criminal fraud scheme. Knowing that DC Solar at best could only expect to lease a tiny fraction of its mobile solar generators, she continued the lie about the high demand for DC Solar’s products,” said U.S. Attorney Talbert. “Thanks to the hard work of attorneys in this Office and agents in the investigating agencies, this fraud was stopped and millions of dollars have been recouped. It is my hope that Carpoff’s sentence will afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct and the need to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant and promote respect for the law.”
“Mrs. Carpoff participated in and enjoyed the spoils of an egregious, complex fraud scheme that provided the Carpoff family and associates with a luxurious lifestyle and esteemed position in the community at the expense of their community and business contacts,” said Acting Special Agent in Charge Dennis Guertin of the FBI Sacramento Field Office. “Complex cases like these are truly a team effort. I am grateful to the dedicated FBI special agents, forensic accountants and professional staff who worked tirelessly to investigate this case in concert with our equally dedicated partners at IRS Criminal Investigation, FDIC Office of Inspector General, and U.S. Attorney’s Office. Our office is deeply committed to identifying and investigating financial fraud. We encourage anyone who is aware of fraud to reach out to our office or submit a tip by calling 1-800-CALL-FBI or submitting information online at tips.fbi.gov.”
“The Chief Operating Officer of DC Solar, Paulette Carpoff, who indulged herself in luxury goods while engaged in lies and deceit, is not an innocent spouse but rather an active conspirator who played a significant and integral role in the largest Ponzi scheme in the Eastern District of California,” said IRS Criminal Investigation Special Agent in Charge Mark H. Pearson. “Her lies and deception finally caught up to her, as her hunger to amass ill-gotten wealth and material goods led her astray. Today’s sentencing sends a clear message of ‘you will be held accountable’ to those involved in schemes to defraud. This case and the outcome is representation of the great work being accomplished when collaborating with our federal partners: the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Federal Depository Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General, and the United States Attorney’s Office, EDCA.”
“Today, Paulette Carpoff was sentenced and held accountable for conspiring with others to carry out a Ponzi scheme that defrauded investors of approximately $1 billion and funded her and her husband’s lavish lifestyle,” said Special Agent in Charge Jeffrey D. Pittano of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC OIG). “The FDIC OIG is committed to working with our law enforcement partners to bring to justice those who undermine the integrity of the Nation’s financial system.”
This case was the product of an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, IRS Criminal Investigation, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Christopher S. Hales and Kevin C. Khasigian prosecuted the case.
On Nov. 9, 2021, Jeff Carpoff was sentenced to 30 years in prison and ordered to pay $790.6 million in restitution for conspiracy to commit wire fraud and money laundering.
On Nov. 16, 2021, Joseph W. Bayliss, 46, of Martinez, was sentenced to three years in prison and ordered to pay $481.3 million in restitution for securities fraud and conspiracy in connection with the DC Solar scheme. On April 12, 2022, DC Solar CFO Robert A. Karmann, 55, of Clayton, was sentenced to six years in prison and ordered to pay $624 million in restitution. On May 31, 2022, former DC Solar employee Alan Hansen was sentenced to eight years in prison and ordered to pay $619 million in restitution.
Two defendants have pleaded guilty to criminal offenses related to the fraud scheme and are scheduled for sentencing: Ryan Guidry, 45, of Pleasant Hill, is scheduled to be sentenced on July 26, 2022, and Ronald J. Roach, 55, of Walnut Creek, is scheduled to be sentenced on Sept. 13, 2022. Guidry faces a maximum statutory penalty of 15 years in prison. Roach faces a maximum statutory penalty of 10 years prison. The actual sentences, however, will be determined at the discretion of the court after consideration of any applicable statutory factors and the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, which take into account a number of variables.

Huntington Woman Sentenced to Prison for Role in Nigerian Fraud Scheme
HUNTINGTON, W.Va. – A Huntington woman was sentenced today to three months in prison, to be followed by three years of supervised release, for her role as a money mule in a Nigerian fraud scheme that scammed money from individuals, many of whom were elderly. Patricia Dudding, 70, was also ordered to pay $1,788,589.24 in restitution
According to court documents and statements made in court, Dudding admitted that she received and wired fraudulent funds through numerous accounts she set up in her name at several different banks from May 2018 through July 2019. Dudding admitted that she did so at the direction of an individual she met online and knew as “Lucas Bennito Antonio” or “Lucas.” Dudding received numerous deposits in those bank accounts from “Lucas” and other individuals located in the United States and abroad. Dudding, and unnamed co-conspirators, would then transfer these funds to bank accounts located in Nigeria.
Dudding further admitted that she became aware that the activities of “Lucas” were not legitimate. A series of employees at the various banks questioned Dudding about her transactions, and in several instances closed her accounts for suspected fraud. To further the scheme, Dudding made false and fraudulent representations to these financial institutions to make it appear that the wire transfers were being sent for legitimate purposes. On April 26, 2019, Dudding sent a wire transfer of $39,000 from her account to an individual in Montana. Upon questioning by a bank employee, Dudding lied about the wire transfer to aid Lucas in completing the transfer of funds to the designated recipient in Montana.
Dudding further admitted that she withdrew victim funds for her personal benefit. According to Dudding, she used the funds to pay her utility and satellite television service. She also used the funds to purchase groceries, drug store items, gasoline, department store items, and restaurant meals. Dudding also made numerous cash withdrawals.
United States Attorney Will Thompson made the announcement and commended the investigative work of the United States Secret Service, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation-Office of Inspector General (FDIC-OIG) and the South Charleston Police Department.
United States District Judge Robert C. Chambers imposed the sentence. Assistant United States Attorney Kathleen Robeson prosecuted the case.

Owners Of Grand Rapids Trucking Company Plead Guilty To Bank Fraud Conspiracy, Pay $1,000,000 In Related Civil Case, In Connection With Covid-19 Relief Fraud
DMR Transportation Falsified Financial Records To Receive A Second-Draw Loan Under The Paycheck Protection Program
GRAND RAPIDS, MICHIGAN — Semsi Salja and Anes Suhonjic, the owners of Grand Rapids-based trucking company DMR Transportation (“DMR”), pleaded guilty in federal court today to conspiring to commit bank fraud in connection with a $290,855.00 loan under the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”). In a related civil case, DMR, Salja, and Suhonjic agreed to pay a total of $1,000,000.00, including a substantial civil monetary penalty under the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act (“FIRREA”).
In 2020, Congress enacted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) to provide emergency federal assistance to the millions of Americans suffering from the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Through the PPP, the CARES Act authorized forgivable loans to small businesses for job retention and certain other expenses.  In December 2020, Congress enacted the Economic Aid to Hard-Hit Small Businesses Act, which reopened the PPP to first-time borrowers and, subject to stricter limitations and conditions, authorized second-draw PPP loans to borrowers that previously received a PPP loan.  Borrowers were eligible for second-draw PPP loans if, among other things, they experienced a revenue reduction of 25% or greater in 2020 relative to 2019.
In its second-draw PPP loan application, DMR knowingly and falsely certified that it realized the required 25% reduction in gross receipts between the second financial quarter of 2019 and the second financial quarter of 2020.   DMR also submitted falsified quarterly balance sheets and other false financial records that were signed by Salja and Suhonjic alongside the application.  In September 2021, DMR sought forgiveness of its second-draw PPP loan by falsely certifying that its second-draw PPP loan proceeds were used to pay eligible business expenses when, in fact, DMR held that money in reserve.
“The PPP involved a limited pool of funds to help small businesses wracked by the disruption of a global pandemic,” United States Attorney Mark Totten said.  “By fraudulently obtaining a second PPP loan, DMR took, for itself, hundreds of thousands of dollars that could have been used to help deserving companies.  My office will continue to aggressively investigate and prosecute these cases.”
“By illegally taking additional money from the Paycheck Protection Program, these defendants harmed the owners and employees of small businesses struggling through the pandemic,” said James A. Tarasca, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI in Michigan. “The FBI is committed to working with our law enforcement partners to investigate and hold accountable anyone taking advantage of a global pandemic to line their own pockets.”
“Today’s guilty plea and FIRREA civil penalties hold the defendants responsible for their roles in fraudulently obtaining a second loan under a federal relief program created to assist small businesses who were struggling as a result of the pandemic,” said Special Agent in Charge Kathy A. Enstrom of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC-OIG). “The FDIC-OIG remains committed to working with our law enforcement partners to hold those accountable who seek to abuse such programs and undermine the integrity of our Nation’s banks.”
Salja and Suhonjic face a maximum of five years in prison.  United States District Judge Jane M. Beckering will determine their sentences after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.
The civil settlement includes the resolution of claims brought under the whistleblower provisions of the False Claims Act.  Under those statutory provisions, a private party can file an action on behalf of the United States and receive a portion of the settlement or judgment proceeds.  The whistleblower case is captioned, United States ex rel DePouw v. DMR Transportation, et al. , No. 1:21-cv-548 (W.D. Mich.).
Assistant U.S. Attorneys Davin M. Reust and Adam B. Townshend represented the United States.  The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s Office of Inspector General and the FBI investigated the case.

Man Arrested for Allegedly Distributing Over $230 Million of Adulterated HIV Medication
A Florida man was arrested today for allegedly distributing more than $230 million in adulterated HIV drugs that were ultimately dispensed to unsuspecting patients throughout the country.
According to an indictment unsealed today, Lazaro Hernandez, 51, of Miami, was allegedly part of a nationwide scheme to defraud the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and illegally distribute more than $230 million in adulterated and misbranded prescription drugs that were dispensed to unsuspecting patients. As alleged in the indictment, Hernandez acquired large quantities of HIV medication illegally and then created false drug labeling and other documentation to make it appear as though these high-priced drugs had been obtained legitimately. To carry out the scheme, Hernandez and co-conspirators established licensed wholesale drug distribution companies in Florida, New Jersey, Connecticut, and New York. Hernandez and his co-conspirators used those companies to sell the adulterated drugs at steep discounts to other co-conspirators at wholesale pharmaceutical distributors in Mississippi, Maryland, and New York. Those wholesale pharmaceutical distributors then resold the drugs to pharmacies throughout the country, which billed the drugs to health insurers, including Medicare, and dispensed the adulterated and misbranded HIV medication to unsuspecting patients.
As alleged in the indictment, between approximately 2019 and 2021, the wholesale pharmaceutical distributors paid Hernandez and his co-conspirators more than $230 million for the illegally acquired and adulterated prescription drugs. Hernandez allegedly laundered those hundreds of millions of dollars through the use of several corporations in Miami.
Hernandez is charged with conspiracy to deliver into interstate commerce adulterated and misbranded drugs, conspiracy to traffic in medical products with false documentation, conspiracy to commit money laundering, and specific money laundering offenses. If convicted of all counts, he faces a maximum total penalty of more than 100 years in prison. The defendant was also charged in a separate, superseding indictment that was returned by a grand jury in Miami on June 14. Hernandez is scheduled to make his initial court appearance in both cases today in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida.
Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Polite, Jr. of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Juan Antonio Gonzalez for the Southern District of Florida, Special Agent in Charge Omar Pérez Aybar of the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (HHS-OIG), and Special Agent in Charge Kyle A. Myles of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC-OIG), Atlanta Region, made the announcement.
HHS-OIG and FDIC-OIG are investigating the case.
Trial Attorney Alexander Thor Pogozelski of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Timothy James Abraham of the Southern District of Florida are prosecuting the case. Assistant U.S. Attorney Emily Stone is handling forfeiture.
An indictment is merely an allegation and the defendant is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.

Owner of Tech Services Company Sentenced to More than Three Years in Prison for $13 Million COVID-Relief Fraud Scheme
Defendant convicted in federal government’s first-ever pandemic fraud trial in the District of Massachusetts
BOSTON – A Winchester man was sentenced yesterday in federal court in Boston in connection with filing fraudulent loan applications seeking more than $13 million in forgivable loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (SBA) for COVID-19 relief through the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act.
Elijah Majak Buoi, 40, was sentenced by U.S. District Court Chief Judge F. Dennis Saylor IV to 39 months incarceration and three years of supervised release. Buoi was also ordered to pay restitution of $2 million and forfeiture of $2 million. On Feb. 24, 2022, Buoi was convicted by a federal jury of four counts of wire fraud and one count of making a false statement to a financial institution.
Beginning in or around April 2020, and continuing until at least in or around June 2020, Buoi devised a scheme to obtain PPP funds by repeatedly filing false and fraudulent loan applications in which he systematically used false tax documents and payroll processing records until he was ultimately awarded a loan.
Buoi submitted six fraudulent PPP loan applications on behalf of his company Sosuda Tech, LLC (Sosuda) to four different SBA-approved lenders. In each loan application, Buoi misrepresented the number of employees and payroll expenses. Buoi also submitted fraudulent IRS tax forms in support of his applications. The evidence at trial showed that Sosuda was a startup company with no U.S.-based payroll and no U.S.-based employees. As a result of his scheme, Buoi obtained a $2 million PPP loan. The government recovered approximately $1.97 million of the loan funds.
The CARES Act is a federal law enacted on March 29, 2020, designed to provide emergency financial assistance to the millions of Americans who are suffering the economic effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. One source of relief provided by the CARES Act was the authorization of up to $349 billion in forgivable loans to small businesses for job retention and certain other expenses, through the PPP. In April 2020, Congress authorized over $300 billion in additional PPP funding.
The PPP allows qualifying small-businesses and other organizations to receive loans with a maturity of two years and an interest rate of 1%. PPP loan proceeds must be used by businesses on payroll costs, interest on mortgages, rent and utilities. The PPP allows the interest and principal on the PPP loan to be forgiven if businesses spend the proceeds on these expenses within a set time period and use at least a certain percentage of the loan towards payroll expenses.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Mackenzie A. Queenin of Rollins’ Securities, Financial, and Cyber Fraud Unit, and Trial Attorney Della Sentilles of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section prosecuted the case.
On May 17, 2021, the Attorney General established the COVID-19 Fraud Enforcement Task Force to marshal the resources of the Department of Justice in partnership with agencies across government to enhance efforts to combat and prevent pandemic-related fraud. The Task Force bolsters efforts to investigate and prosecute the most culpable domestic and international criminal actors and assists agencies tasked with administering relief programs to prevent fraud by, among other methods, augmenting and incorporating existing coordination mechanisms, identifying resources and techniques to uncover fraudulent actors and their schemes, and sharing and harnessing information and insights gained from prior enforcement efforts.

In August 2018, True-Cut and Brenizer were ordered by the Minnesota Department of Labor and Industry to cease and desist from doing business. In December 2019, True-Cut’s contractor license expired and was never renewed.
According to court documents, on May 1, 2020, Brenizer submitted a false and misleading Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) application in the name of True-Cut seeking approximately $841,000, but the application was denied. On May 12, 2020, Brenizer again submitted a false and misleading PPP application in the name of True-Cut seeking approximately $841,000 in PPP funds. This time, in order to conceal his role in submitting a fraudulent application, Brenizer submitted the application under the name of another individual whom Brenizer falsely claimed was the 90 percent owner of True-Cut. Brenizer further falsely stated that True-Cut’s average monthly payroll was $336,400 for approximately 30 employees. In support of both loan applications, Brenizer caused to be submitted to the lender fraudulent supporting documentation, such as falsified bank statements and IRS documents.  In addition, Brenizer falsely certified that he was not subject to any pending criminal charges even though he was named in multiple felony charges pending in the State of Minnesota, including check forgery, identify theft, and theft by swindle. Due to these various misrepresentations and omissions, on May 13, 2020, Brenizer’s second application was approved, and he received $841,000 in PPP funds.
According to court documents, instead of using the PPP funds for authorized business expenses, such as payroll, Brenizer transferred approximately $650,000 to a bank account unrelated to True-Cut and made a $29,000 payment to purchase a Harley-Davidson motorcycle, among other impermissible expenditures and transactions.
Brenizer was sentenced today in U.S. District Court before Judge Eric C. Tostrud. On January 31, 2022, Brenizer pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud, one count of money laundering, and one count of aggravated identity theft.
The CARES Act is a federal law enacted on March 29, 2020, designed to provide emergency financial assistance to the millions of Americans who are suffering the economic effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. One source of relief provided by the CARES Act was the authorization of up to $349 billion in forgivable loans to small businesses for job retention and certain other expenses, through the PPP. In April 2020, Congress authorized over $300 billion in additional PPP funding.
The PPP allows qualifying small-businesses and other organizations to receive loans with a maturity of two years and an interest rate of one percent. PPP loan proceeds must be used by businesses on payroll costs, interest on mortgages, rent, and utilities. The PPP allows the interest and principal on the PPP loan to be forgiven if the business spends the loan proceeds on these expense items within a designated period of time after receiving the proceeds and uses at least a certain percentage of the PPP loan proceeds on payroll expenses.

Two Burlington County Women Charged in $175 Million Check-Cashing Scheme
CAMDEN, N.J. – Two Burlington County women with businesses in Riverside, New Jersey and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, were arrested today and charged with operating an illegal unlicensed check cashing operation that cashed over $175 million in checks and failed to file Currency Transaction Reports (CTRs) on their customers, U.S. Attorney Philip R. Sellinger announced.
Luciana Machado, 42, of Riverside, and Juliana Gomes-Souza, 45, of Cinnaminson, Jersey, are charged by complaint with one count of conspiracy to fail to file CTRs and operate an unlicensed money transmitting business. Machado and Gomes-Souza are expected to make their initial appearances before U.S. Magistrate Judge Ann Marie Donio later today.
According to documents filed in this case and statements made in Court:
Since at least 2018, Machado and Gomes-Souza have operated two businesses – Via Brazil I in Riverside and Via Brazil II in Philadelphia – as a criminal enterprise that has allowed their customers to cash over $175 million in checks without generating CTRs or financial records identifying their customers. This facilitates the customers’ ability to pay off-the-books employees and laborers in cash and avoid payroll and income taxes.
The charge carries a maximum potential penalty of five years in prison and a fine $250,000, or twice the gross financial gain derived or twice the loss caused by the offense, whichever is greatest.
U.S. Attorney Sellinger credited special agents of IRS-Criminal Investigation, under the direction of Acting Special Agent in Charge Tammy Tomlins; postal inspectors of the U.S. States Postal Inspection Service, under the direction of Postal Inspector in Charge Damon Wood, Philadelphia Division; special agents of the Department of Homeland Security, Homeland Security Investigations, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge William Walker; special agents of the U.S. Department of Labor, Office of Inspector General, New York Region, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Jonathan Mellone; agents of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of Inspector General, New York Region, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Patricia Tarasca; agents of the New Jersey State Commission of Investigation, under the direction of Executive Director Chadd W.

Florida Man Arrested for $2.5 Million COVID-Relief Fraud
BOSTON – A former Massachusetts resident and owner of a Massachusetts-based painting company has been arrested and charged in connection with allegedly filing a fraudulent loan application to obtain $2.5 million in Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan funds under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act.
Vinicius Santana, 34, of Boca Raton, Fla. and formerly of Revere, was charged with one count of wire fraud. Santana was arrested Monday evening at Miami International Airport. He appeared in federal court in Miami yesterday afternoon and will appear in Massachusetts at a later date.
According to the charging documents, Santana owned Complete Home Care, LLC (CHC), a painting company in Massachusetts. In April 2020, Santana submitted four different PPP loan applications on behalf of CHC. The first three applications, in which Santana allegedly listed five employees and an average monthly payroll of between $10,000 and $18,000, were denied. In the fourth application for CHC, it is alleged that Santana falsely claimed to have 154 employees and an average monthly payroll of $1 million. On May 11, 2020, a bank issued Santana’s company a $2,500,000 loan based on the alleged false representations in the fourth application.
After receiving the funds, it is alleged that Santana misused the loan proceeds to buy cars and invest in cryptocurrency.

New York And Florida Resident Sentenced To 51 Months In Prison For $6.8 Million Paycheck Protection Program Fraud Scheme
NEWARK, N.J. – A dual New York and Florida resident was sentenced today to 51 months in prison for his role in a scheme to fraudulently obtain federal Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans totaling over $6.8 million, U.S. Attorney Philip R. Sellinger announced.
Gregory J. Blotnick, 35, of Florida, previously pleaded guilty before U.S. District Judge Brian R. Martinotti to an information charging him with one count of wire fraud and one count of money laundering. Judge Martinotti imposed the sentence by videoconference today.
According to documents filed in this case and statements made in court:
From April 2020 through March 2021, Blotnick submitted 21 fraudulent PPP loan applications to 13 lenders on behalf of nine purported businesses that Blotnick controlled.
The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act is a federal law enacted on March 29, 2020, designed to provide emergency financial assistance to the millions of Americans who are suffering the economic effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. One source of relief provided by the CARES Act was the authorization of up to $349 billion in forgivable loans to small businesses for job retention and certain other expenses, through the PPP. In April 2020, Congress authorized over $300 billion in additional PPP funding.
The PPP allows qualifying small businesses and other organizations to receive loans with a maturity of two years and an interest rate of 1 percent. PPP loan proceeds must be used by businesses on payroll costs, interest on mortgages, rent, and utilities. The PPP allows the interest and principal on the PPP loan to be forgiven if the business spends the loan proceeds on these expense items within a designated period of time after receiving the proceeds and uses at least a certain percentage of the PPP loan proceeds on payroll expenses.
On Blotnick’s fraudulent PPP applications, which sought a total of approximately $6.8 million in total loans, Blotnick falsified various information to the lenders including the number of employees, the federal tax returns for his purported businesses, and payroll documentation. Blotnick obtained approximately $4.6 million in PPP funds and then misused the loan proceeds, including by transferring the funds to brokerage accounts from which he placed more than approximately $3 million in losing stock trades.
In addition to the prison term, Judge Martinotti sentenced Blotnick to two years of supervised release and ordered him to pay restitution of $4,577,631.
U.S. Attorney Sellinger credited special agents of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, Office of Inspector General, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Robert Manchak; special agents of IRS – Criminal Investigation, under the direction of Acting Special Agent in Charge Tammy Tomlins; special agents of the Social Security Administration, Office of the Inspector General, New York Field Division, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Sharon MacDermott; special agents of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation – Office of the Inspector General, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Patricia Tarasca in New York; and special agents of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Office of Inspector General, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Stephen Donnelly, with the investigation leading to today’s sentencing.

Foreign National Involved in Religious Institution Check Theft Conspiracy Sentenced to Over Three Years in Federal Prison
Defendant Participated in a Conspiracy that Stole more than 3,000 Checks from Religious Institutions
Greenbelt , Maryland – U.S. District Judge Theodore C. Chuang sentenced Marius Vaduva, age 27, of Hollywood, Florida, to 42 months in federal prison, followed by 5 years of supervised release, for conspiracy to commit bank fraud and wire fraud.  As part of his sentence, Vaduva will be required to pay $1,334,230.84 in restitution.
The sentence was announced by United States Attorney for the District of Maryland Erek L. Barron; Acting Postal Inspector in Charge Charles Wickersham of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service - Washington Division; Acting Special Agent in Charge Selwyn Smith of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Baltimore; Acting Special Agent in Charge Quenton Sallows of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC-OIG) Mid-Atlantic Region; Chief Marcus Jones of the Montgomery County Police Department; Chief Toni Dezomits of the Cary, North Carolina, Police Department; and Sheriff Dusty Rhoades of the Williamson County, Tennessee, Sheriff’s Office.
According to his guilty plea, beginning in June 2018 to January 2021, Vaduva and his co-conspirators conspired to steal checks from the U.S. mail intended for religious institutions and deposit the illegally obtained funds into multiple fraudulent bank accounts at various victim financial institutions.  Conspirators, including Vaduva, conducted the thefts by driving to roadside mailboxes of churches and other religious institutions and removing the mail, specifically targeting donation checks.
As part of the scheme to defraud, Vaduva and other co-conspirators fraudulently opened bank accounts at victim financial institutions under false identities.  Conspiracy members often opened fictitious bank accounts with the aid of a co-conspirator who was an employee at one of the victim financial institutions.  In addition, Vaduva and his co-conspirators used at least two extended family members who were minors to assist in the account openings.
Vaduva and co-conspirators then withdrew cash from the fraudulent bank accounts through ATMs and spent the illegally obtained proceeds using debit cards associated with the bank accounts.  Additionally, Vaduva deposited stolen checks in fraudulently opened bank accounts held in others’ identities.  Vaduva opened at least nine fraudulent accounts between October 24, 2019 to November 20, 2019.  The same nine fraudulent accounts received a total of at least 119 stolen checks totaling approximately $41,528.99.  Vaduva also deposited at least four stolen checks totaling approximately $2,120.69 into other bank accounts.  Those checks had been stolen from religious institutions in North Carolina and Virginia.
Further, upon his arrest in February 2021, Vaduva’s cell phone contained images of at least 21 stolen checks, totaling $10,119.68.
In total the conspiracy stole at least approximately $1,320,829.69 from 3,075 stolen checks.
Co-conspirators Daniel Velcu, age 43, of Baltimore, Maryland; Marian Unguru, age 36, of Baltimore, Maryland; Vali Unguru, age 19, of Baltimore, Maryland; and Florin Vaduva, age 31, of Dania Beach, Florida previously pled guilty to conspiracy to commit bank fraud and wire fraud.   Nicolae Gindac, age 52, of Dania Beach, Florida pled guilty to the same charge and was sentenced to 54 months in federal prison.  Mateus Vaduva, age 29, of Baltimore, Maryland pled guilty to the same charge and was sentenced to five years in federal prison.
United States Attorney Erek L. Barron commended the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, HSI, the FDIC Office of Inspector General, the Montgomery County Police Department, the Cary (North Carolina) Police Department, and the Williamson County (Tennessee) Sheriff’s Office for their work in the investigation.  Mr. Barron thanked Assistant U.S. Attorney Elizabeth Wright, who prosecuted the case.

Tulsa Man Sentenced for Defrauding Investor and Banks of Millions,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/tulsa-man-sentenced-defrauding-investor-and-banks-millions,"June 1, 2022",2022,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Tulsa Man Sentenced for Defrauding Investor and Banks of Millions
A man who defrauded an investor and two banks out of at least $8.4 million was sentenced Wednesday in federal court, announced U.S. Attorney Clint Johnson.
Chief U.S. District Judge John F. Heil III sentenced William Brian Mulder, 64, of Tulsa to 84 months in federal prison followed by 3 years of supervised release. He was further ordered to pay to pay $4.5 million in restitution to the investor and $3.9 million in restitution to Firstar Bank and BancFirst.
“William Mulder portrayed himself as a successful investor, trusted mentor and friend, but it was a façade. Instead, he was a con artist who defrauded his friends and banks for years in an effort to sustain a lifestyle beyond his means,” said U.S. Attorney Clint Johnson. “This 7-year sentence reflects the egregious nature of the defendant’s longstanding criminal deceit. Our federal law enforcement partners are to be commended for exposing Mulder’s elaborate web of lies and ensuring justice for the victims in this case.”
“To support his extravagant lifestyle, Mr. Mulder meticulously deceived victims based in our community for years,” said FBI Oklahoma City Special Agent in Charge Edward J. Gray. “Mulder’s sprawling web of lies and fraud was only untangled through the tenacious effort of FBI agents working in partnership with investigators from the IRS, Treasury Department, and FDIC. Mr. Mulder’s sentence should give pause to other con-men seeking to defraud Oklahoma citizens and businesses.”
“William Mulder used deceit and trickery to defraud trusting friends and investors of their hard-earned money,” said Christopher J. Altemus, Jr., Special Agent in Charge, IRS Criminal Investigation, Dallas Field Office. “IRS-CI special agents are committed to using their forensic accounting skills to help unravel complex fraud and money laundering schemes. Today's sentencing demonstrates how federal law enforcement will band together to help put an end to the criminal behavior of those who prey on investors for their own financial gain.”
On Oct. 19, 2021, Mulder pleaded guilty to causing the interstate transmission of moneys taken by fraud and money laundering. He was set to begin trial at the time but opted to plead guilty instead.
According to court documents, Mulder misrepresented himself as worth millions to friends. Mulder told several individuals that a wealthy Missouri widow had left him over $100 million in a blind trust in appreciation for his services as an insurance salesman for the widow. In another story, he said he was the beneficiary of a different blind trust worth hundreds of millions of dollars from his father. Mulder convinced his friends that if they pooled their investments with his fortune, they could grow their money faster. The government asserted there were no investments made by Mulder on their behalf but instead, Mulder deposited checks into his personal bank accounts and used the funds to pay off credit card debts and to run a coffee shop chain.
To cover his tracks, Mulder created a web of convoluted rules and restrictions to keep the victims from seeing the progress of their investments. He also moved money between more than 60 bank accounts to make it difficult for the investors and law enforcement to follow the trail of money.
In his plea agreement, Mulder specifically admitted that beginning in 2000 and continuing through 2017, he received numerous checks totaling approximately $4.5 million from the investor, who was a local businessman and friend to Mulder. Mulder advised the victim to create a trust for his special needs son for which Mulder would be the trustee and have complete discretion and control. Mulder told the victim that he would prudently invest the funds on the son’s behalf. Instead, Mulder used the funds for his own personal expenses and to enrich himself.
Mulder also admitted that in December 2015, he fraudulently received a check from the victim in the amount of $142,500 and deposited funds from the check in the amount of $83,378.54 into his personal account, which he later used on a personal investment in generators in Missouri.
Further, Mulder admitted that he lied about his assets and submitted fabricated documents to obtain loans from Oklahoma banks in order to support a lifestyle he couldn’t afford on his own.
Prosecutors contended that Mulder applied for and received loans worth millions of dollars from five banks. From 2004 to 2014, Mulder obtained the loans by pledging phony collateral that included fictitious life insurance policies supposedly issued by Merrill Lynch that appeared to insure Mulder and his family members. Mulder used the same phony policy numbers with every new bank he swindled, adding new phony policies as he went. To secure each loan, he provided the banks with the same types of fabricated records and documents. On some of the documents, Mulder forged the signature of a former Merrill Lynch colleague. Mulder was able to pay off three of the banks by obtaining new loans from other banks. Ultimately, two banks— Firstbank and BancFirst— suffered about $3.9 million in losses.
Prosecutors asserted that Mulder further tried to impede the federal investigation into his criminal conduct by fabricating a story blaming one of his bankers for creating the fictitious life insurance policies in Mulder’s and his family members’ names. Agents debunked the claim based on the evidence that Mulder began his scheme long before he ever met the accused banker.
Mulder was remanded into the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service and will be transferred to a Federal Bureau of Prisons facility.
The FBI, IRS-Criminal Investigation, U.S. Department of Treasury Office of Inspector General; and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) Office of Inspector General conducted the investigation. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Thomas E. Duncombe, Vani Singhal, and Kevin C. Leitch prosecuted the case.

Vacaville Man Sentenced to 8 Years in Prison for Billion Dollar DC Solar Ponzi Scheme,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/vacaville-man-sentenced-8-years-prison-billion-dollar-dc-solar,"May 31, 2022",2022,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Vacaville Man Sentenced to 8 Years in Prison for Billion Dollar DC Solar Ponzi Scheme
SACRAMENTO, Calif. — Alan Hansen, 51, of Vacaville, was sentenced today to eight years in prison and ordered to pay $619,415,950 in restitution for participating in a billion-dollar Ponzi scheme involving DC Solar, U.S. Attorney Phillip A. Talbert announced.
On July 23, 2020, Hansen pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit an offense against the United States and aiding and abetting money laundering.
According to court documents, between 2011 and 2018, DC Solar manufactured mobile solar generator units (MSG), solar generators that were mounted on trailers. The company touted the versatility and environmental sustainability of the mobile solar generators and claimed that they were used to provide emergency power to cellphone towers and lighting at sporting and other events. Jeff Carpoff, 51, Paulette Carpoff, 51, both of Martinez, and their co-conspirators solicited investors by claiming that there were favorable federal tax benefits associated with investments in alternative energy. They sold solar generators that did not exist to investors, making it appear that solar generators existed in locations that they did not, creating false financial statements, and obtaining false lease contracts, among other efforts to conceal the fraud. In reality, at least half of the approximately 17,000 solar generators claimed to have been manufactured by DC Solar did not exist and DC Solar paid early investors with funds contributed by later investors.
According to court documents, Hansen was an employee of a telecom company with which DC Solar had done some limited business. In that role, Hansen accepted $1 million from co-conspirators at DC Solar to fraudulently sign a false contract reflecting a much greater amount of supposed business leasing MSGs.  Hansen’s co‑conspirators used that false contract to induce substantial investments by victims in DC Solar. After signing the contract, Hansen took a job at DC Solar at a significant pay increase and left his former employment.  Later, as a DC Solar executive, Hansen and a co-conspirator agreed to share $20,000 cash from Jeff Carpoff to sign a false agreement related to the earlier contract by forging the signature of a former telecom company employee. Hansen’s co-conspirators used the false contract and forged agreement to induce still further payments by victims for MSGs. Hansen was paid for signing the first false contract through a series of interstate wire transfers into an account he set up in the name of a consulting company. Hansen knew the money he received came from payments by DC Solar investors, and that DC Solar was deceiving them to induce those payments.
On Nov. 9, 2021, Jeff Carpoff was sentenced to 30 years in prison and ordered to pay $790.6 million in restitution for conspiracy to commit wire fraud and money laundering. His wife Paulette Carpoff has pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit an offense against the United States and money laundering, and is scheduled to be sentenced on June 28, 2022.
On Nov. 16, 2021, Joseph W. Bayliss, 46, of Martinez, was sentenced to three years in prison and ordered to pay $481.3 million in restitution for securities fraud and conspiracy in connection with the DC Solar scheme. On April 12, 2022, DC Solar CFO Robert A. Karmann, 55, of Clayton, was sentenced to six years in prison and ordered to pay $624 million.
Other defendants have pleaded guilty to criminal offenses related to the fraud scheme and are scheduled for sentencing: Ronald J. Roach, 55, of Walnut Creek, is scheduled to be sentenced on June 28, 2022; and Ryan Guidry, 45, of Pleasant Hill, is scheduled to be sentenced on June 7, 2022.
This case is the product of an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, IRS Criminal Investigation, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Christopher S. Hales and Kevin C. Khasigian are prosecuting the case.
Paulette Carpoff and Guidry face a maximum statutory penalty of 15 years in prison. Roach faces a maximum statutory penalty of 10 years prison. The actual sentences, however, will be determined at the discretion of the court after consideration of any applicable statutory factors and the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, which take into account a number of variables.

Richmond Man Pleads Guilty to $1 Million Paycheck Protection Program Fraud Scheme
RICHMOND, Va. – A Richmond man pleaded guilty today to defrauding the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) of over $1 million in funds intended for small businesses affected by the COVID-19 Pandemic.
According to court documents, from April 2020 to April 2021, Moe Ayemen Mathews, 51, with the assistance of his co-conspirator, submitted at least 38 fraudulent PPP loan applications to financial institutions for businesses the conspirators claimed to own and operate. In their first draw PPP applications, the conspirators falsely certified that the information and supporting documentation provided was true and accurate when, in fact, the applications contained false statements, false certifications, and fabricated tax documents. For instance, the conspirators repeatedly inflated or fabricated the average monthly payroll and number of employees working for their purported businesses, and they submitted fabricated tax documents to substantiate the false information provided in their PPP applications. Once their fraudulent applications were approved, the conspirators did not use the funds in accordance with the program’s requirements.
Additionally, after their first draw PPP applications were approved and funded, the conspirators submitted fraudulent second draw PPP applications predicated on their fraudulently-obtained first draw PPP loans. When submitting the second draw PPP applications for their purported businesses, the conspirators concealed the fact that they had intentionally and knowingly submitted false and misleading first draw PPP applications. Once these second-draw applications were approved, the conspirators used the loan proceeds contrary to the program’s requirements.
Mathews is scheduled to be sentenced on October 7. He faces a maximum penalty of 30 years in prison. Actual sentences for federal crimes are typically less than the maximum penalties. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after taking into account the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.
Jessica D. Aber, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia; Stanley M. Meador, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI’s Richmond Field Office; Hannibal “Mike” Ware, Inspector General of the Small Business Administration (SBA); and Jay N. Lerner, Inspector General of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), made the announcement after Senior U.S. Districy Judge Henry E. Hudson accepted the plea.

California Couple Charged with Defrauding Paycheck Protection Program
HONOLULU – A federal grand jury returned a four-count indictment today against Christopher A. Mazzei, age 44, and Erin V. Mazzei, age 41, of Arroyo Grande, California. The indictment charges the defendants with wire fraud, money laundering, and conspiracy in connection with a scheme to defraud the government of forgivable Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan funds intended for COVID-19-related relief.
The indictment alleges that the Christopher and Erin Mazzei, husband and wife, submitted applications for PPP funds to a Hawaii financial institution and two other financial institutions on behalf of three purported businesses, each time utilizing interstate wires. For each application, the Mazzeis allegedly created false Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax returns and payroll records, which they presented as authentic and submitted to the banks to support their claims for PPP loan funds. According to the indictment, as a result of the false and fraudulent applications, the Mazzeis received $1,365,000 in PPP loan funds, which they then used for personal purposes, such as to purchase multiple sport utility vehicles and a home in Kapolei, Hawaii, among other things.
The CARES Act is a federal law enacted on March 29, 2020, designed to provide emergency financial assistance to the millions of Americans who are suffering the economic effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. One source of relief provided by the CARES Act was the authorization of up to $349 billion in forgivable loans to small businesses for job retention and certain other expenses, through the PPP. In April 2020, Congress authorized over $300 billion in additional PPP funding.
The PPP allows qualifying small businesses and other organizations to receive loans with a maturity of two years and an interest rate of 1 percent. PPP loan proceeds must be used by businesses on payroll costs, interest on mortgages, rent, and utilities. The PPP allows the interest and principal on the PPP loan to be entirely forgiven if the business spends the loan proceeds on these expense items within a designated period of time after receiving the proceeds and uses at least a certain percentage of the PPP loan proceeds on payroll expenses.
“Our entire community suffers when federal funds appropriated to provide critical pandemic relief are illegally diverted for personal gain,” said U.S. Attorney Clare E. Connors. “We will pursue and prosecute those who defraud programs that provide a financial lifeline to struggling small businesses in Hawaii and across the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic.”
“As the country continues to battle the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, these indictments are an unfortunate reminder that there are always those who will stoop low to unjustly enrich themselves, even at the cost of those suffering around them,” said Special Agent in Charge Bret Kressin, IRS Criminal Investigation (IRS:CI), Seattle Field Office. “Financial fraud against government assistance programs is not victimless, as it directly steals resources from those who truly need it. Today’s court actions serve notice that IRS:CI will continue to protect our communities by investigating those who choose to commit these crimes.”
“The allegations described in this indictment represent significant abuse of the Paycheck Protection Program that was created to assist small businesses that were suffering the economic hardships caused by the pandemic,"" said Special Agent in Charge Jeffrey D. Pittano, of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC OIG). “The FDIC OIG will continue to work with our law enforcement partners in the District of Hawaii, and elsewhere throughout the country, to investigate those who seek to take advantage of Federal relief programs and threaten to undermine the integrity of our Nation's financial institutions.”
“Today’s indictment sends a clear message that those who exploit and defraud financial institutions and the government’s pandemic relief funds will be brought to justice,” said Cory Nootnagel, Acting Special Agent in Charge, Western Region, Office of Inspector General for the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection.
A federal indictment is merely an accusation. A defendant is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.
The investigation was conducted jointly by IRS Criminal Investigation, the FDIC Office of Inspector General, and the Office of Inspector General for the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, with assistance from the Small Business Administration Office of Inspector General and the U.S. Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration. Assistant U.S. Attorney Gregg Paris Yates is handling the prosecution.
On May 17, 2021, the Attorney General established the COVID-19 Fraud Enforcement Task Force to marshal the resources of the Department of Justice in partnership with agencies across government to enhance efforts to combat and prevent pandemic-related fraud. The Task Force bolsters efforts to investigate and prosecute the most culpable domestic and international criminal actors and assists agencies tasked with administering relief programs to prevent fraud by, among other methods, augmenting and incorporating existing coordination mechanisms, identifying resources and techniques to uncover fraudulent actors and their schemes, and sharing and harnessing information and insights gained from prior enforcement efforts.

Bank CEO Convicted For Taking Bribes In Connection With Loans Guaranteed By The Small Business Administration,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/bank-ceo-convicted-taking-bribes-connection-loans-guaranteed,"May 26, 2022",2022,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Bank CEO Convicted For Taking Bribes In Connection With Loans Guaranteed By The Small Business Administration
Damian Williams, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, announced today the conviction of EDWARD SHIN, then-CEO of a Pennsylvania-based bank (the “Bank”), for taking bribes in connection with the Bank’s issuance of loans that were guaranteed by the United States Small Business Administration (“SBA”).  SHIN was arrested in May of 2019 and charged with taking bribes by siphoning off a portion of commissions on SBA-guaranteed loans and causing the Bank to issue SBA-guaranteed and commercial loans to companies in which SHIN had a secret interest.  The charges are the culmination of a joint investigation by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation – Office of Inspector General (“FDIC-OIG”), Homeland Security Investigations (“HSI”), the SBA Office of the Inspector General (“SBA-OIG”), and the Office of the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (“SIGTARP”).  SHIN was convicted on all counts of the indictment in Manhattan federal court before U.S. District Judge John P. Cronan.
According to the allegations in the Criminal Complaint, Indictment, and statements made during trial in Manhattan federal:
The SBA helps Americans start, build, and grow businesses by guaranteeing certain loans made by banks to help those businesses succeed.  Between 2009 and 2013, the Bank offered a range of financial products, including SBA-guaranteed loans to small businesses in the New York-New Jersey area, which the Bank could extend only on the condition that all aspects of those loans complied with SBA regulations and SBA’s standard operating procedures.  In particular, SBA regulations and procedures prohibited bank officers, including SHIN, from receiving any payments in connection with SBA-backed loans and prohibited banks from extending such loans to any institution in which a bank officer held an interest.
Notwithstanding these regulations, SHIN, then the CEO of the Bank, secretly solicited and received bribe payments in connection with SBA-guaranteed loans issued by the Bank and caused the Bank to extend SBA-guaranteed and commercial loans to companies in which SHIN had secret ownership interests.  Specifically, when the Bank issued business loans that did not involve the use of any actual broker, SHIN nonetheless arranged to have his longtime friend, a real estate and loan broker (the “Broker”), inserted unnecessarily into the transaction solely to generate a broker fee that could be shared with SHIN; in fact, the Broker did no actual work to earn a commission on those transactions, but split the “broker’s fee” with SHIN as an illegal kickback.
SHIN also arranged for the Bank to issue SBA-guaranteed loans to businesses in which he secretly retained an ownership interest, in violation of SBA regulations and procedures.  For example, in or about June 2010, the Bank issued an SBA-guaranteed loan for approximately $950,000 to a business in New York, New York.  Although documents submitted to the Bank for purposes of securing the loan did not mention SHIN’s financial interest, the business was secretly operated as a partnership between SHIN, the Broker, and another individual.   The loan ultimately went into default status, ultimately resulting in a loss to the Bank of approximately $591,278.60.
*                      *                      *
SHIN, 58, of Ambler, Pennsylvania, was convicted of one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud and wire fraud affecting a financial institution, which carries a maximum potential sentence of 30 years in prison, one count of conspiracy to commit bank bribery, which carries a maximum potential sentence of five years in prison, one count of conspiracy to commit loan fraud, which carries a maximum potential sentence of five years in prison, another count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud, which carries a maximum potential sentence of 30 years in prison, and one count each of bank bribery, and theft of funds by a bank officer, each of which carries a maximum potential sentence of 30 years in prison.  The maximum potential sentences in this case are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendant will be determined by the judge.
Mr. Williams praised the outstanding investigative work of the FDIC-OIG, HSI, SBA-OIG, and SIGTARP.
This case is being handled by the Office’s Money Laundering and Transnational Criminal Enterprises Unit.  Assistant U.S. Attorneys Tara La Morte, Anden Chow, Jessica Greenwood, and Daniel M. Tracer are in charge of the prosecution.

COVID Relief Fraudsters Sentenced To Prison
Orlando, Florida – U.S. District Judge Anne C. Conway has sentenced Tomas Ziupsnys (39, Kissimmee) to five years in federal prison for conspiracy to commit bank fraud, bank fraud, and aggravated identity theft. Holly Lynn Urban (36, Kissimmee) was sentenced to two years and six months in federal prison for conspiracy to commit bank fraud. The court also ordered both defendants to forfeit $632,000, which they had obtained from their participation in the bank fraud conspiracy. Ziupsnys had pleaded guilty on February 3, 2022, and Urban had pleaded guilty on January 20, 2022.
According to court documents, Ziupsnys and Urban conspired to defraud multiple banks by submitting false Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan applications to the Small Business Administration (SBA) and PPP-approved lenders.
The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act is a federal law that was enacted in March 2020.  It was designed to provide emergency financial assistance to millions of Americans who suffered the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. One source of relief that the CARES Act provided was the authorization of up to $349 billion in forgivable loans to small businesses for job retention and certain other expenses through the PPP.  In April 2020, Congress authorized over $300 billion in additional PPP funding.
The PPP allowed qualifying small businesses and other organizations to receive loans with a maturity of two years and an interest rate of one percent. Businesses were required to use PPP loan proceeds for payroll costs, interest on mortgages, rent, and utilities. The PPP allowed the interest and principal to be forgiven if the business spent the proceeds on these expenses within a set time period and used at least a certain percentage of the loan toward payroll expenses.
In furtherance of their bank fraud conspiracy, Ziupsnys and Urban submitted six loan applications that contained numerous false representations about the number of employees, average monthly payroll expenses, and annual sales revenue of five companies that they purportedly owned and controlled. Ziupsnys also submitted fabricated tax, payroll, and revenue documents in support of those six fraudulent PPP applications.
Moreover, Ziupsnys submitted false tax forms in support of at least one of the applications, using without authorization the personally identifiable information of Victim-1 and Victim-1’s two minor children. Ziupsnys had obtained the victims’ Social Security numbers when he contacted Victim-1 and expressed interest in employing Victim-1 and the two children in connection with the FedEx routes that he and Urban intended to purchase with PPP funds.  After obtaining the victims’ Social Security numbers, Ziupsnys did not contact Victim-1 again concerning employment, and instead used the Social Security numbers on the false tax forms that he submitted in support of one of the loan applications that he and Urban submitted.
Ziupsnys and Urban’s false and fraudulent representations caused the SBA and the PPP lenders to approve and fund three PPP loans, totaling approximately $897,000 ($265,300 of which the bank froze before Urban and Ziupsnys could access the funds). Ziupsnys and Urban unlawfully transferred a significant portion of the PPP funds to an escrow account in connection with their intended purchase of a FedEx route.
In addition to conspiring with Urban, Ziupsnys submitted three additional fraudulent PPP loan applications, requesting more than $497,000. None of those applications were funded.
This case was investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of the Inspector General, and the Small Business Administration Office of the Inspector General. It was prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Emily C. L. Chang.

Hilo Man Pleads Guilty to Defrauding Paycheck Protection and Disaster Loan Programs
HONOLULU – Carey Mills, 43, of Hilo, Hawaii pleaded guilty today before U.S. District Judge Derrick K. Watson to a single-count Information, charging him with wire fraud in connection with a scheme to defraud the Government of program funds intended for Coronavirus-related relief. Sentencing is scheduled for October 4, 2022. Mills faces a maximum term of imprisonment of 30 years and a fine of up to $1,000,000.
The Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) is a federal loan program that is intended to help small businesses survive the COVID-19 pandemic by providing them with funds to cover certain payroll costs, including benefits, interest on mortgages, rent and utilities. The Economic Injury Disaster Loan program (EIDL) provides low-interest loans and grants to small businesses that experience substantial financial disruptions due to federally-declared disasters, including the COVID-19 pandemic.
According to information presented in court, Mills submitted multiple applications for PPP and EIDL funds on behalf of three businesses under his control, Kanaka Maoli Hookupu Center, New Way Horizon Travel, and Uilani Kawailehua Foundation, each time utilizing interstate wires. To support the applications, Mills submitted fraudulent payroll documents and IRS forms, which included false employee and wage payment records. As a result of the false and fraudulent applications, Mills received $937,575 in the form of two forgivable PPP loans, one EIDL loan, and one EIDL grant to which he was not entitled.
“Congress funded the PPP and EIDL programs to provide a financial lifeline to struggling small businesses in Hawaii and across the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic,” said U.S. Attorney Clare E. Connors. “Unfortunately, bad actors have targeted these critical assistance programs and fraudulently diverted much-needed resources. Our office will investigate all allegations of unlawful use of these funds and is committed to ensuring federal taxpayer dollars are used for their intended purpose.”
“The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration will aggressively pursue those who endeavor to defraud taxpayer-funded Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act programs, which were established to provide assistance to American business owners and their employees during these unprecedented times,” said J. Russell George, Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration. “We appreciate the efforts of the U.S. Department Justice and our law enforcement partners in this effort.”
The investigation was led by the U.S. Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, with assistance from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of the Inspector General, the Small Business Administration Office of the Inspector General, and Homeland Security Investigations. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Rebecca M. Perlmutter and Gregg Paris Yates handled the prosecution.

A federal jury convicted a Florida woman today for laundering approximately $786,000 in money stolen from Medicare, Medicaid, and private health insurers as part of a sprawling health care fraud scheme in Miami.
According to court documents and evidence presented at trial, Jesmina Ramirez, 50, of Miami Gardens, laundered hundreds of thousands of dollars in fraud proceeds by cashing checks written from five fraudulent medical supply companies and returning that cash, minus a fee, to her co-conspirators. The five fraudulent medical supply companies for whom she laundered money – BF Distributors Corp.; Timely Medical Services Corp.; Ortho-Med Solution Inc.; Expedited Medical Supplies Corp.; and Prime Orthopedic Solutions Corp. – billed Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurers more than $48 million for medical equipment the companies never actually purchased and never provided to any patients. Ramirez laundered the stolen money by cashing more than 120 checks from the fraudulent companies over more than two years.
Ramirez was convicted of one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering and one count of money laundering. She faces up to 20 years in prison on each count. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors. Sentencing is scheduled for July 13.

Sacramento Man Pleads Guilty to COVID-19 Relief Fraud, Embezzlement, and Unemployment Fraud
SACRAMENTO, Calif. — Aaron Ashcraft, 42, of Sacramento, pleaded guilty today to one count of wire fraud and one count of bank fraud in a scheme to defraud the Paycheck Protection Program of over $1.2 million in COVID-19 relief loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (SBA) under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, U.S. Attorney Phillip A. Talbert announced.
The CARES Act was enacted on March 29, 2020, to provide emergency financial assistance to the millions of Americans who are suffering the economic effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. One source of relief provided by the CARES Act was the authorization of forgivable loans to small businesses for job retention and certain other expenses, through the Paycheck Protection Program.
According to court documents, Ashcraft carried out the fraud scheme between May 2020 and April 2021. As part of his scheme, Ashcraft submitted to SBA-approved lenders at least seven fraudulent Paycheck Protection Program loan applications in the names of purported businesses. In the applications, Ashcraft falsely represented that each of the purported businesses had employees and monthly payroll expenses. To support the Paycheck Protection Program loan applications, Ashcraft submitted fabricated records including Internal Revenue Service forms, checking account statements, and payroll summaries. In total, Ashcraft requested over $1.2 million in Paycheck Protection Program loans and obtained approximately $920,000.
In addition to Paycheck Protection Program fraud, Ashcraft admitted that, from September 2017 through June 2020, he embezzled at least approximately $780,000 from his former employer—a street-sweeping company in Sacramento. Ashcraft held multiple positions at the company, including chief financial officer. As chief financial officer, Ashcraft had access to the company’s business credit card accounts. Without authorization, Ashcraft used those accounts to pay for personal expenses.
Finally, Ashcraft admitted to defrauding the Maine Department of Labor. According to his plea agreement, in July 2020, Ashcraft applied for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, falsely claiming that he lived in Maine and was unable to work due to COVID-19. To support his application, Ashcraft submitted falsified IRS forms in which he represented that, in 2019, he operated a business in Maine that received over $160,000 in income and made a net profit of over $66,000. In total, Ashcraft fraudulently obtained unemployment compensation of over $58,000.
As part of his plea agreement, Ashcraft agreed to pay restitution as follows:
This case is the product of an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General, and the Small Business Administration Office of Inspector General. Assistant U.S. Attorney Matthew Thuesen is prosecuting the case.
U.S. District Judge Kimberly J. Mueller is scheduled to sentence Ashcraft on Aug. 22, 2022. He faces up to 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine for wire fraud and up to 30 years in prison and a $1 million fine for bank fraud. The actual sentence, however, will be determined at the court’s discretion after consideration of any applicable statutory factors and the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, which take into account a number of variables.

South Bay Man Pleads Guilty to Participating in a Multimillion-Dollar Real Estate Scam Involving Fake Open Houses at Not-for-Sale Homes
LOS ANGELES – A South Bay man pleaded guilty today to a federal criminal charge for participating with his sister in a $6 million real estate scam that involved listing homes without the owners’ consent and collecting money from multiple would-be buyers for each of the not-for-sale homes.
Adolfo Schoneke, 44, of Torrance, pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud.
United States District Judge R. Gary Klausner has scheduled an August 8 sentencing hearing, at which time Schoneke will face a statutory maximum sentence of 20 years in federal prison.
On April 4, Schoneke’s sister, Bianca Gonzalez, 39, a.k.a. Blanca Schoneke, pleaded guilty to the same criminal charge. Her sentencing hearing is scheduled for October 3.
According to court papers, from November 2013 to December 2016, Schoneke and Gonzalez, along with co-conspirators, operated real estate and escrow companies based in Cerritos, La Palma and Long Beach under a variety of names, including MCR and West Coast Realty Services. Schoneke, Gonzalez and other co-conspirators found properties that they would list for sale – even though they did not intend to sell them to anyone.
The properties were listed on real estate websites such as the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) and were marketed as below-market short sales opportunities. In some cases, the homes were marketed through open houses arranged by tricking homeowners into allowing their homes to be used.
Multiple offers were accepted for each of the not-for-sale properties, but the co-conspirators hid this fact from the victims and instead led each victim to believe that his or her offer was the only one accepted. The co-conspirators strung victims along – sometimes for years – by telling them closings were being delayed because lenders needed to approve the purported short sales.
At the co-conspirators’ direction, office workers opened bank accounts to hide the co-conspirators’ involvement in the fraud. Those accounts were used to receive down payments on the homes and other payments from victims who were convinced to transfer the full “purchase price” after receiving forged short sale approval letters. The co-conspirators directed the office workers to withdraw large amounts of cash from these accounts, which made the proceeds harder to trace.
Investigators estimate that several hundred victims collectively lost more than $6 million during the scheme.
A co-conspirator, Mario Gonzalez, 50, was charged in a related case and pleaded guilty in January 2019 to conspiracy to commit wire fraud. His sentencing is scheduled for October 3.
The FBI and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of Inspector General investigated this matter. The investigation was initiated by numerous complaints to the Long Beach Police Department and the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department, both of which provided substantial assistance during the federal investigation.
Assistant United States Attorney Kerry L. Quinn of the Major Frauds Section is prosecuting this case.

Woman Pleads Guilty to Laundering More Than $700,000
A Florida woman pleaded guilty today to laundering $735,695 in money stolen from Medicare, Medicaid, and private health insurers as part of a sprawling health care fraud scheme in Miami.
According to court documents, Loyda Triana, 65, of Miami, laundered the fraudulent proceeds of five fraudulent medical supply companies over a two-year period. These companies — BF Distributors Corp, Timely Medical Services Corp., Ortho-Med Solution Inc., Expedited Medical Supplies Corp., and Prime Orthopedic Solutions Corp — were fake medical supply companies that billed Medicare, Medicaid, and private health insurers more than $48 million for medical equipment the companies never actually purchased and never actually provided to any patients. Triana laundered the stolen money by cashing checks issued by these companies and returning the cash, minus a fee, to her co-conspirators. To date, more than 15 individuals have been charged as part of the government’s investigation into this fraud and money laundering scheme.
Triana pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. She is scheduled to be sentenced on May 25, and faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.

Jury Convicts in Check Kiting Trial
TOPEKA, KAN. – A federal jury convicted a Kansas man of 31 counts of bank fraud, one count of making a false statement in connection with a Small Business Administration guaranteed loan, and one count of making a false statement in a loan or credit card application.
According to court documents and evidence presented at trial, Tyler Gillum, 51, of Plainville owned and operated Plainville Livestock Commission Inc. from 2006 until 2019. Between January 2015 and August 2017, Gillum wrote checks and made wire transfers between various accounts under his control at various banks in a scheme commonly known as check kiting. This is when checks are continually written back and forth to fraudulently inflate account balances tricking banks into honoring checks written with insufficient funds. Gillum’s scheme resulted in losses of more than $10 million to the banking system.
Gillum also applied for and obtained a $1,500,000 loan, secured by the U.S. Small Business Administration, and a $500,000 line of credit from Almena State Bank, while concealing he’d previously signed an approximately $6.1 million promissory note to TBK Bank of Dallas, Texas.
“Because of the defendant’s crimes, banks suffered millions of dollars in losses. These fraudulent acts should be of concern to everyone, because the stability our nation’s banking system is vital to the financial health of this country,” said U.S. Attorney Duston Slinkard, District of Kansas.
The FBI, U.S.D.A. Office of Inspector-General, S.B.A. Office of Inspector-General, and F.D.I.C. Office of Inspector-General investigated the case.

Nevada Man Indicted in Multi-Million Dollar Fraudulent Check Scheme
A federal grand jury in Las Vegas returned an indictment Wednesday charging a Nevada man with using fraudulent checks to steal money from victims’ bank accounts. Michael Zeto, 76, of Las Vegas, is charged in a 20-count indictment with wire fraud, bank fraud and aggravated identity theft.  He made his initial court appearance before U.S. Magistrate Judge Cam Ferenbach of the U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada.
According to court documents, Zeto partnered with foreign telemarketers who provided Zeto with the names, bank account numbers and other personal information for American consumers who supposedly had purchased products. These consumers often had not, in fact, agreed to purchase the products and had not authorized anyone to debit their bank accounts.
Zeto allegedly knew that at least one of his telemarketing partners was engaged in fraud, that many of the supposed sales sent by his telemarketing partners were not real sales and that consumers had not authorized debits from their bank accounts. Despite knowing that sales were fraudulent, the indictment alleges that Zeto (using the information provided by his telemarketing partners) created fraudulent checks payable to companies he controlled and arranged to open accounts with banks and payment processors in the United States to deposit the fraudulent checks — thereby taking and attempting to take millions of dollars from victims’ accounts. The indictment also alleges that Zeto knew that many of the victims were older Americans and that he took steps to reduce the likelihood that financial institutions would scrutinize, and possibly close, the bank accounts into which he was depositing the fraudulent checks
“The defendant is charged with acting as a vital link in a scheme with foreign telemarketing partners to defraud American victims,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton, head of the Justice Department’s Civil Division. “The Department of Justice is committed to protecting older Americans from fraud, including people who knowingly help fraudsters.”
“This indictment reflects our office’s commitment to bring to justice criminals who prey on the elderly,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Christopher Chiou for the District of Nevada. “Working closely with the Justice Department’s Consumer Protection Branch and our law enforcement partners, we will continue to prosecute fraudsters who target seniors and other vulnerable Nevada residents. If you or someone you know is age 60 or older and has been a victim of financial fraud, help is standing by at the Department of Justice’s National Elder Fraud Hotline: 1-833-FRAUD-11 (1-833-372-8311).”
“Crimes against the elderly target some of the most vulnerable people in society,” said Inspector in Charge Eric Shen of the of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service’s Criminal Investigations Group. ""The Inspection Service has been at the forefront of protecting customers from fraud schemes for many years and we will continue to investigate and stop those who exploit older Americans for their own illegal gains.”
“This indictment charges the defendant for his alleged role in a fraudulent check scheme that took and attempted to take millions of dollars from the bank accounts of American consumers,” said Special Agent in Charge Kathy A. Enstrom of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC OIG).  “The FDIC OIG remains committed to working with our law enforcement partners to pursue those who seek to defraud banking customers and threaten the integrity of the banking system.”
If convicted, Zeto faces a maximum term of imprisonment of 20 years for wire fraud and 30 years for bank fraud and a mandatory two-year term of imprisonment for aggravated identity theft. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.
The U.S. Postal Inspection Service and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation-Office of Inspector General are investigating the case.
Trial Attorneys Daniel Zytnick and Timothy Finley of the Justice Department’s Consumer Protection Branch and Assistant U.S. Attorney Richard Anthony Lopez of the District of Nevada are prosecuting the case.
If you or someone you know is age 60 or older and has been a victim of financial fraud, help is available at the National Elder Fraud Hotline: 1-833-FRAUD-11 (1-833-372-8311). This Department of Justice hotline, managed by the Office for Victims of Crime, is staffed by experienced professionals who provide personalized support to callers by assessing the needs of the victim and identifying relevant next steps. Case managers will identify appropriate reporting agencies, provide information to callers to assist them in reporting, connect callers directly with appropriate agencies and provide resources and referrals, on a case-by-case basis. Reporting is the first step. Reporting can help authorities identify those who commit fraud, and reporting certain financial losses due to fraud as soon as possible can increase the likelihood of recovering losses. The hotline is staffed seven days a week from 6:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. Eastern time. English, Spanish and other languages are available.

Liberian National Sentenced to 10 Years for $23 Million COVID-19 Relief Fraud,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/liberian-national-sentenced-10-years-23-million-covid-19-relief,"April 21, 2022",2022,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Liberian National Sentenced to 10 Years for $23 Million COVID-19 Relief Fraud
A Liberian national who orchestrated a fraudulent scheme to secure more than $23 million in forgivable Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans was sentenced Thursday afternoon to 10 years in federal prison, announced U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Texas Chad E. Meacham.
Steven Jalloul, a 43-year-old tax consultant from the Dallas area, was first charged via criminal complaint in September 2020; he pleaded guilty on in October 2021 to a superseding information charging him with one count of engaging in monetary transactions using property derived from unlawful activity. He was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Jane J. Boyle.
“Mr. Jalloul callously exploited the Paycheck Protection Program, which was designed to keep struggling businesses afloat during the pandemic. He took money out of the hands of businesspeople who truly needed it,” said U.S. Attorney Chad E. Meacham. “The Justice Department will not stand for PPP fraud.”
According to plea papers, Mr. Jalloul admitted he defrauded lenders participating in the Paycheck Protection Program — a measure authorized by Congress in the early days of the pandemic to award forgivable loans to small business impacted by COVID-19 — while awaiting sentencing in a separate tax fraud case.
In court documents, he admitted that he submitted roughly 170 falsified PPP loan applications to lenders (including through a fintech company) seeking more than $23 million on behalf of over 160 clients of his tax preparation business, Royalty Tax & Financial Services LLC.
Mr. Jalloul admitted he inflated clients’ employee rosters and monthly payroll expenses in order to increase the amount of PPP funds for which their businesses would be eligible.  He generally charged clients a 2 to 20 percent commission on the PPP loans they received and even listed his ex-wife as Royalty Tax’s authorized representative, without her consent, when seeking an inflated PPP loan for his own business.
In total, 97 false PPP loan applications were ultimately approved, and Mr. Jalloul’s clients were awarded more than $12 million in PPP money. Those clients paid him at least $972,114 in fees. Mr. Jalloul also admitted to submitting a fraudulent PPP loan application on behalf of his tax preparer company and received $163,500 in PPP funds.
Mr. Jalloul was already behind bars at FCI-Seagoville, having pleaded guilty to tax fraud in the separate case in January 2020; in that case, he was sentenced to six years in federal prison. Judge Boyle ruled that he will serve his sentence in the PPP case consecutive to his sentence in the tax fraud case.
The Dallas Field Offices of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's Office of Inspector General and IRS - Criminal Investigation conducted the investigation. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Fabio Leonardi and Marty Basu are prosecuting the case. Assistant U.S. Attorney Dimitri Rocha is handling the asset-forfeiture component of the case.
The Paycheck Protection Program was authorized under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, a federal law enacted on March 29, 2020, to provide emergency financial assistance to Americans suffering economic hardship due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The PPP initially provided for up to $349 billion in forgivable loans to small businesses for payroll costs and certain other expenses, including rent; in April 2020, Congress authorized more than $300 billion in additional PPP funding. The PPP allows qualifying small businesses to receive loans with a maturity of two years and an interest rate of 1 percent. In addition, the PPP allows both the interest and principal on the loans to be forgiven if the business spends the money on qualifying expenses within a designated period of time.

Fresno Man Sentenced to over 5 Years in Prison for Investment Fraud, Bank Fraud, and Tax Evasion
FRESNO, Calif. — Kenneth Shane Patterson, 44, of Fresno, was sentenced today by U.S. District Judge Dale A. Drozd to five years and six months in prison and ordered to pay $1.9 million in restitution for wire fraud, bank fraud, and evading the payment of taxes, U.S. Attorney Phillip A. Talbert announced.
According to court documents, Patterson convinced a small business owner to give him more than $1 million over approximately 31 months so that Patterson could acquire a skilled nursing facility in Pasadena. Patterson promised to then sell the facility to the business owner at below market value. Patterson told the business owner that he needed the money to clear liens and pay other expenses so the deal would close. In reality, Patterson never actually intended to buy the facility and instead spent the money on unrelated business expenses and his own gambling.
In addition to defrauding the business owner, Patterson defrauded Bank of America in a check-kiting scheme by writing two checks totaling $230,000 from Patterson’s business account at JPMorgan Chase to another of his business accounts at Bank of America. The Chase account’s balance at the time was less than $10,000. After writing the checks, Patterson quickly transferred and spent the deposited funds before Bank of America realized Patterson’s check had bounced. Bank of America sustained a loss of approximately $150,000.
Additionally, Patterson evaded paying federal income tax from tax years as far back as 2003 through various methods of evasion, including having no personal bank accounts, incurring expenses on accounts not in his name, and dealing in a high volume of cash. Patterson pleaded guilty on Oct. 19, 2021.
This case was the product of an investigation by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigation. Assistant U.S. Attorney Alexandre Dempsey prosecuted the case.

California Man Convicted of COVID-19 Relief Fraud
A federal jury convicted a California man today of misappropriating hundreds of thousands of dollars in forgivable Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (SBA) under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act.
According to evidence presented at trial, Oumar Sissoko, 59, whose last known residence was in Temecula, submitted a PPP loan application on behalf of his company, Road Doctor California LLC, and obtained $7.25 million. The loan application certified that the funds would be used to retain workers and maintain payroll or make mortgage-interest payments, lease payments, and utility payments. In early May 2020, Sissoko misappropriated hundreds of thousands of dollars of the PPP loan proceeds to use for impermissible purposes, including the purchase of a luxury car for more than $100,000, the satisfaction of a loan made to Sissoko in connection with his prior acquisition of a different luxury car, and the purchase of a computer for almost $6,000. Sissoko also attempted to transmit approximately $150,000 to accounts in Mauritania associated with a different company for which Sissoko purported to serve as CEO.
Sissoko was convicted of four counts of wire fraud. He is scheduled to be sentenced on July 18 and faces up to 20 years in prison for each count of conviction. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.

Judge sentences St. Louis man to more than 10 years in federal prison for bank fraud in conjunction with the Payment Protection Program (PPP)
ST. LOUIS – Robert Williams, age 58, of St. Louis, Missouri, appeared before United States District Court Judge Matthew T. Schelp on today’s date.  Based on a previous plea of guilty, Williams was sentenced to 125 months in federal prison for numerous counts of bank fraud related to Payment Protection Program (“PPP”) loans.
The United States Small Business Administration (“SBA”) is an executive-branch agency of the United States government that provides support to entrepreneurs and small businesses. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act is a federal law that was enacted in or around March 2020 to provide emergency financial assistance to the millions of Americans suffering the economic impact caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
One source of relief provided for in the CARES Act is the authorization of forgivable loans to small businesses for job retention and certain other expenses, through the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). The purpose of loans issued under the PPP was to enable small businesses suffering from the economic downturn to continue to pay salary or wages to their employees.
To obtain a PPP loan, a qualifying business is required to submit a PPP loan application, signed by an authorized representative of the business. The PPP loan application requires the business to acknowledge the program rules and make certain affirmative certifications to obtain the PPP loan.
According to court documents, Williams obtained federal loans provided through the CARES Act that resulted in a loss of up to approximately $2.7 million.  Williams applied for these loans at Midwest Regional Bank, PNC Bank and submitted false information to receive funding.
The investigation included a review of numerous PPP loan applications and financial accounts during the summer of 2020.  Williams completed and submitted approximately thirty different PPP loan applications that contained materially false statements and false supporting documents related to the ownership of a business and the business’ payroll including the number of employees and monthly payroll expenses.
Investigators also determined that Williams did not use the PPP loan funds for any appropriate business expenses but used funds for his own personal benefit including the purchase of vehicles such as a Maserati Levante and a Jaguar, F-Pace. Williams also assisted several other businesses in brokering and submitting fraudulent PPP loan applications.  During the investigation the FBI seized approximately $466,000 and vehicles.  Williams has also agreed to an order of restitution for $1,231,491.
This case was investigated by the U.S. Small Business Administration and FDIC of the Office of Inspector General, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  The case was prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Edward Dowd III.

DC Solar CFO Sentenced to 6 Years in Prison for Billion Dollar Ponzi Scheme
SACRAMENTO, Calif. — Robert A. Karmann, 55, of Clayton, was sentenced today to six years in prison and ordered to pay $624 million in restitution for participating in a billion-dollar Ponzi scheme involving DC Solar, U.S. Attorney Phillip A. Talbert announced.
According to court documents, Karmann was a certified public accountant (CPA) that DC Solar hired first as its Controller in 2014, and later as its Chief Financial Officer. DC Solar manufactured mobile solar generator units (MSG), which were solar generators that were mounted on trailers. The MSGs were sold to investors who were given generous federal tax credits, and who were falsely led to believe that there was extensive demand from third parties to lease these MSGs to create a revenue stream. In fact, that demand was virtually non-existent. DC Solar had instead become a fraud scheme that took new investor money to pay older investors, using circular transactions that were fraudulently disguised to look like real third-party lease revenue.
According to court documents, Karmann and the other co-conspirators, including company founder Jeff Carpoff, carried out an accounting and lease revenue fraud using the Ponzi-like circular payments. Carpoff and others lied to investors about the market demand for DC Solar’s MSGs and its revenue from leasing to third parties. Then Karmann, Carpoff, and others covered up these lies with techniques including false financial statements, false operation reports, and false written summaries of the supposed revenue from leasing MSGs to third parties. In 2016, 2017, and 2018, Karmann oversaw the hidden circular transfers of funds, delivered false financial information to another co-conspirator for use in tax returns and tax documents, provided false compiled financial statements to an investor representative for multiple funds, and provided other false information to investor representatives about DC Solar’s third-party leasing. Karmann also directed others in DC Solar’s accounting department, including one subordinate whom Karmann told to “make it up” when responding to a customer request for location reports on their MSGs. During these years that Karmann knowingly joined in the fraud, DC Solar pulled in over $600 million in investor funds as a result of this scheme.
On Nov. 9, 2021, Jeff Carpoff was sentenced to 30 years in prison and ordered to pay $790.6 million in restitution for conspiracy to commit wire fraud and money laundering. His wife, Paulette Carpoff, 47, has pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit an offense against the United States and money laundering, and is scheduled to be sentenced on May 10, 2022.
On Nov. 16, 2021, Joseph W. Bayliss was sentenced to three years in prison and ordered to pay $481.3 million in restitution for securities fraud and conspiracy in connection with the DC Solar scheme.
Other defendants have pleaded guilty to criminal offenses related to the fraud scheme and are scheduled for sentencing: Alan Hansen, 50, of Vacaville, is scheduled to be sentenced on April 26, 2022; Ronald J. Roach, 54, of Walnut Creek, is scheduled to be sentenced on May 3, 2022; and Ryan Guidry, 44, of Pleasant Hill is scheduled to be sentenced on June 7, 2022.
This case is the product of an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, IRS Criminal Investigation, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Christopher S. Hales and Kevin C. Khasigian are prosecuting the case.
Paulette Carpoff, Hansen, and Guidry face a maximum statutory penalty of 15 years in prison. Roach faces a maximum statutory penalty of 10 years prison. The actual sentences, however, will be determined at the discretion of the court after consideration of any applicable statutory factors and the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, which take into account a number of variables.

District of Columbia Man Sentenced to 56 Months in Prison for Fraud, Money Laundering, and Identity Theft Schemes
Schemes Caused More Than $1.5 Million in Losses
WASHINGTON – Jamar Skeete, 38, of Washington, D.C., was sentenced today to 56 months in prison on federal charges stemming from his years-long role in at least four business e-mail compromise fraud and money laundering schemes that caused more than $1.5 million in intended losses.
The announcement was made by U.S. Attorney Matthew M. Graves and Greg L. Torbenson, U.S. Postal Inspector in Charge for the Washington Division, U.S. Postal Inspection Service.
Skeete pleaded guilty on Nov. 15, 2021, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, to one count of money laundering, one count of identity theft, and two counts of wire fraud.  On the same date, he also pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud and wire fraud in a case that was originally indicted in the Southern District of New York and transferred to the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia for plea and sentencing.  He was sentenced in both cases by the Honorable District Judge John D. Bates. Following his prison term, Skeete will be placed on three years of supervised release. He also must pay combined restitution judgments in the two cases totaling $697,836, and forfeiture money judgments totaling $381,387.
According to the statements of offense acknowledged by Skeete, between September 2017 and June 2019, Skeete received and laundered the proceeds of at least four separate business e-mail compromise schemes targeting the City of Flint, Michigan, an Illinois-based company operating senior care facilities, and other businesses.  Skeete used two stolen identities and multiple fraudulent shell company accounts to receive and launder the proceeds of the business e-mail compromise schemes in the District of Columbia and elsewhere.  He also assumed an address used in two of the schemes by submitting a fraudulent “hold mail” request to the U.S. Postal Service.  In the schemes originally charged in the Southern District of New York, Skeete conspired with 14 other individuals to launder other fraud proceeds out of a fraudulent shell company account.  All told, Skeete participating in diverting and laundering more than $1.5 million
In a business e-mail compromise (or BEC) scheme, conspirators infiltrate the computer systems of a victim company through phishing attacks or otherwise.  Once there, they impersonate the victim’s business partners and, claiming a change in bank accounts, trick the victim into sending payments not to business partners, but to the conspirator’s bank accounts.
The case was investigated by the U.S. Postal Inspection Service Washington Division, with assistance provided FBI’s Washington Field Office and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation-Office of Inspector General. The case was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Christopher B. Brown, with assistance from Paralegal Specialists Michon Tart and former Paralegal Specialist C. Rosalind Pressley.  Significant assistance was also provided by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Alexander Li and Thomas Burnett of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York.

Columbus Woman Sentenced to 24 Months and Full Restitution for Stealing $240k from Non-Profits,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/columbus-woman-sentenced-24-months-and-full-restitution-stealing,"March 30, 2022",2022,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Columbus Woman Sentenced to 24 Months and Full Restitution for Stealing $240k from Non-Profits
COLUMBUS, Ga. – A Columbus teacher who admitted to stealing approximately $240,000 from charitable organizations and a local dental office was sentenced to federal prison and ordered to repay the victims in full.
Trenna Denise Trice, 59, of Columbus, was sentenced to serve 24 months in prison to be followed by three years of supervised release and $240,259 in restitution by U.S. District Clay Land on March 29, after she pleaded guilty to wire fraud on Dec. 20, 2021. There is no parole in the federal system.
“Ultimately, it was Trenna Trice’s greed and gambling addiction that led to this moment. Fraudsters who steal the hard-earned money of others must be held to account for these crimes which so often have a harmful ripple effect across a community,” said U.S. Attorney Peter D. Leary. “Our office and our law enforcement partners will continue the work to bring these criminal fraud cases to light and to justice.”
“Ms. Trice was held accountable for her egregious misconduct in stealing funds from these organizations and using the stolen proceeds to fund her gambling addiction,"" said FDIC OIG Special Agent in Charge Kyle A. Myles. “The FDIC Office of Inspector General remains committed to working with our law enforcement partners to bring to justice those who threaten to harm the banking system and the community as a whole.""
According to court documents, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation-Office of the Inspector General (FDIC-OIG) initiated an investigation into the financial activities of Trice in May 2019, following reports of significant casino losses sourced by an unidentified income stream. The investigation into possible sources of income for her casino activity revealed that her sole source of income was working as a teacher for the Muscogee County School District (MCSD). Prior to teaching, she worked for a dental office and she worked as a volunteer campaign coordinator for the Columbus branch of the United Negro College Fund (UNCF) from 2005 – 2017.
Trice was responsible for organizing the annual Columbus Mayor’s Masked Ball, UNCF’s primary fundraising activity. Her duties included collecting cash, credit card contributions and check payments for donations and ticket sales. During the course of the investigation, agents determined that Trice diverted numerous smaller contributions for her own personal use. UNCF ended their relationship with Trice in 2017, following questions regarding financial irregularities that were indicative of embezzlement. It was later discovered that Trice had also been terminated by the dental office following similar allegations. Trice was also collecting donations for a nonprofit corporation known as SAMARC run by two former NBA basketball players who conduct an annual basketball camp for underprivileged kids in Columbus.
In total, agents identified 109 checks and 265 credit card transactions fraudulently deposited into Trice’s own accounts without authorization. Trice told investigators she had a crippling gambling addiction for the last decade and the money was stolen to fuel her gambling addiction and compensate for her gambling losses. In total, with checks and credit cards, Trice is known to have stolen $240,259 from the following victims: UNCF ($162,044), the dental office ($70,231), SAMARC ($7,784) and the Georgia Dental Society ($200).
This case was investigated by the FDIC-OIG.

Man Convicted for $27 Million PPP Fraud Scheme,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/man-convicted-27-million-ppp-fraud-scheme,"March 29, 2022",2022,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Man Convicted for $27 Million PPP Fraud Scheme
A federal jury convicted a California man yesterday for submitting fraudulent applications seeking money from the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), submitting false statements to a financial institution, and money laundering.
According to court documents and evidence presented at trial, Robert Benlevi, 53, of Encino, submitted 27 PPP loan applications to four banks between April and June 2020 on behalf of eight companies solely owned by Benlevi. In the applications, Benlevi sought a total of $27 million in forgivable PPP loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (SBA) under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. In his fraudulent applications, Benlevi represented that each of his companies had 100 employees and average monthly payroll of $400,000, even though he knew that the companies did not have any employees or payroll expenses. The evidence further showed that Benlevi also submitted fabricated IRS documents falsely stating that each of the companies had an annual payroll of $4.8 million.
Based on Benlevi’s fraudulent loan applications, three of Benlevi’s companies — 1Stellar Health LLC, Bestways2 Health LLC, and Joyous-Health4U LLC — obtained $3 million in PPP funds. Although Benlevi falsely represented that the funds sought through the PPP loan applications would be used to pay payroll and certain other business expenses, the evidence showed that he instead used them for personal expenses, including cash withdrawals, payments on his personal credit cards, transfers to other personal and business accounts he controlled, and renting an oceanfront apartment in Santa Monica. In a single day, Benlevi withdrew from the Bestways2 Health account $248,000 of PPP funds in cashier’s checks, which were deposited into other accounts that Benlevi controlled.
Benlevi was convicted of bank fraud, false statements to a financial institution, and money laundering. He is scheduled to be sentenced on June 27 and faces up to 30 years in prison for each of the bank fraud and false statement charges, and up to 10 years in prison for each count of money laundering. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.

Computer consultant sentenced to prison for access device fraud scheme
ATLANTA – Kevin Kirton has been sentenced for running an access device fraud scheme that involved stealing over $600,000 in fraudulent tax refunds from the Internal Revenue Service.
“Kirton created technical ‘solutions’ to conduct his own fraud schemes and help others commit fraud,” said U.S. Attorney Kurt R. Erskine. “Every thief believes they have developed a new undetectable method to steal.  As in this case, they will be caught, prosecuted, and face years in federal prison to contemplate their failed endeavor.”
“Kirton was part of a significant tax fraud scheme and his operation defrauded American taxpayers by using stolen identities to solicit the issuance of fraudulent tax refunds,” said Special Agent in Charge, James E. Dorsey, IRS. “This sentencing should serve as a warning to other would-be schemers.   As tax filing season continues, those attempting similar thefts from the US Treasury should be aware, Special Agents of IRS – Criminal Investigation will continue the aggressive pursuit of anyone attempting to defraud America's tax system.""
“As evidenced by the length of the prison sentence in this case, fraud is a pernicious crime, especially when it involves identity theft.” said U.S. Secret Service Special Agent in Charge Steven R. Baisel. “The Secret Service along with our federal partners will continue to aggressively investigate and bring to justice those attempting to compromise our financial infrastructure.”
“The egregious criminal conduct in this case resulted in the theft of both identities and tax refunds, and shows once again that crime does not pay,” stated Kyle A. Myles, Special Agent in Charge, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation – Office of Inspector General (FDIC-OIG).  “We continue to work together with our law enforcement partners to combat financial crime -- and its impact on our nation’s banks and financial institutions.”
According to U.S. Attorney Erskine, the charges and other information presented in court: Kevin Kirton created a computer program to file fraudulent federal income tax returns with the IRS. The computer program stored stolen identities and could be used to submit fraudulent tax returns in the names of stolen identities to the IRS, effectively automating stolen identity tax refund fraud. The computer program could be accessed remotely via the internet to prepare fraudulent tax returns. The resulting fraudulent tax refunds were deposited onto prepaid debit cards in the names of identity theft victims.
To help conceal the fraud activity, Kirton developed techniques to hide Internet Protocol addresses so the IRS could not trace a fraudulent tax return back to one particular origination point. Kirton also set up a bootleg phone system that he believed would not be susceptible to wiretaps to communicate with other criminals.
A search warrant was conducted at Kirton’s residence and law enforcement discovered, among other things, hundreds of prepaid debit cards in the names of identity theft victims and numerous fake driver’s licenses. Law enforcement also found a Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration information booklet titled “Income and Withholding Verification Processes are Resulting in the Issuance of Potentially Fraudulent Tax Refunds.”
While Kirton’s case was pending and he was out on bond, he telephonically contacted an associate who was detained at the Robert A. Deyton Detention Facility, seeking to influence the testimony of a cooperator in his case. Recorded jail calls between Kirton and his jailed associate show that Kirton repeatedly sought to convey veiled threats to the cooperator through the jailed associate. Due to this conduct, Kirton’s bond was revoked and he was detained pending resolution of his case.
Kevin Kirton, 44, of Dallas, Georgia, was sentenced on March 14, 2022, to six years, nine months in prison, to be followed by three years of supervised release, and ordered to pay restitution in the amount of $629,551. On June 17, 2021, he pleaded guilty to access device fraud and aggravated identity theft.
This case was investigated by the Internal Revenue Service - Criminal Investigation, the U.S. Secret Service, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation – Office of Inspector General.
Assistant U.S. Attorneys Samir Kaushal and Alana Black and Special Assistant U.S. Attorney Zack Howard prosecuted the case.

Camden County Man Admits Fraudulently Obtaining Paycheck Protection Program Loan
CAMDEN, N.J. – A Camden County, New Jersey, man today admitted fraudulently obtaining a federal Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan of $237,500, U.S. Attorney Philip R. Sellinger announced.
Cornell McCoy, 49, of Lawnside, New Jersey, pleaded guilty by videoconference before U.S. District Judge Karen M. Williams in Camden federal court to an information charging him with one count of bank fraud.
According to documents filed in this case and statements made in court:
The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act is a federal law enacted in March 2020 and was designed to provide emergency financial assistance to the millions of Americans who are suffering the economic effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. One source of relief provided by the CARES Act was the authorization of hundreds of billions of dollars in forgivable loans to small businesses for job retention and certain other expenses, through a program referred to as the Paycheck Protection Program (the “PPP”). To obtain a PPP loan, a qualifying small business must apply and provide information on its operations, including the number of employees and payroll expenses. Businesses generally had to provide supporting documentation.
In February 2021, McCoy applied for a PPP loan on behalf of Silver Cup Services Group LLC, a company that he owned. McCoy stated on the application that Silver Cup had 12 employees and an average monthly payroll of $95,000. He also submitted federal tax forms and returns that purported to show that Silver Cup paid $300,000 in wages during each quarter of 2019 and that McCoy earned more than $800,000 in income from Silver Cup in 2019. In fact, Silver Cup had no employees other than McCoy himself and paid no wages in 2019. The tax forms submitted with the application were forged. In April 2021, the lender approved the loan based on the fraudulent application and disbursed $237,500 to a bank account controlled by McCoy.
The charge of bank fraud carries a maximum penalty of 30 years in prison and a fine of $1 million. As part of his guilty plea, McCoy agreed to make restitution in the full amount of the PPP loan and agreed to forfeit the contents of the bank account to which the loan proceeds were disbursed. Sentencing is scheduled for July 20, 2022.
U.S. Attorney Sellinger credited special agents of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation – Office of the Inspector General, under the direction of Patricia Tarasca, Special Agent-in-Charge, New York Regional Office; special agents of the Social Security Administration, Office of the Inspector General, New York Field Division, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Sharon MacDermott; special agents of the FBI’s South Jersey Resident Agency, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Jacqueline Maguire in Philadelphia; and special agents of the U.S. Department of Labor, Office of the Inspector General, New York Region, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Jonathan Mellone, with the investigation leading to today’s guilty plea.
The government is represented by Senior Trial Counsel Jason M. Richardson and Assistant U.S. Attorney Daniel A. Friedman of the U.S. Attorney’s Office’s Criminal Division in Camden.

Hollywood Executive Agrees to Plead Guilty to Fraud and Money Laundering Charges for Stealing Money from COVID Relief Program
LOS ANGELES – The former chief executive of Aviron Pictures has agreed to plead guilty to federal fraud and money laundering charges, admitting that he applied for and received $1.7 million in loans under the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) for Aviron entities when the entire operation was being shuttered as a result of his embezzlement.
In a plea agreement filed today in United States District Court, William Sadleir, 67, of Beverly Hills, agreed to plead guilty to one count of bank fraud and one count of money laundering. Sadleir is scheduled to formally enter the guilty pleas on March 16.
Sadleir filed bank loan applications that fraudulently sought more than $1.7 million dollars in forgivable PPP loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (SBA) under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. According to court documents, Sadleir obtained the loans for three Aviron entities by falsely representing that the funds would be used to support payroll expenses for 33 employees at each company, when in fact the entities were no longer operational.
Within days of the loans being funded on May 1, 2020, Sandleir transferred nearly $1 million to his personal checking account.
Sadleir “expended a substantial amount of the fraudulent loan proceeds on utility bills, mortgage expenses, and his personal attorney, among other things,” he admitted in his plea agreement. Sandleir “did not use any of the fraudulent loan proceeds to pay employees of the Aviron companies.”
Following the discovery of the fraudulent loan applications, federal agents seized $308,058 of fraudulent loan proceeds from an Aviron account, and Sandleir returned $1,122,090 to the bank that funded the loans. As a result of the fraudulent PPP loan scheme, the SBA suffered losses of $282,566. In his plea agreement, Sandleir agreed to pay full restitution.
Once he pleads guilty to the two offenses, Sandleir will face a statutory maximum sentence of 50 years in federal prison. Prosecutors have agreed to recommend that whatever sentence is imposed should run concurrent with a sentence to be imposed in a pending case in the Southern District of New York. Sandleir is scheduled to be sentenced in the New York case on May 10 after he pleaded guilty in January to wire fraud for misappropriating more than $25 million that had been invested in Aviron.
The Los Angeles case was investigated by the FBI, the SBA’s Office of Inspector General, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s Office of Inspector General.
Assistant United States Attorney Gregory Bernstein of the Major Frauds Section is prosecuting this case.

Former Seattle doctor sentenced to 4 years in prison for defrauding pandemic relief programs
Created phony businesses and employees to try to claim more than $3 million in federal disaster funding
Seattle – A former Seattle doctor was sentenced today in U.S. District Court in Seattle to 4 years in prison for fraudulently seeking over $3.5 million in Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) and Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) COVID-19 relief funds.  Eric R. Shibley, 43, of Seattle, was convicted following a trial in November 2021.  At today’s sentencing hearing U.S. District Judge John C. Coughenour said the sentence was due to “the blatant nature of the fraud and its size.” Judge Coughenour also noted Shibley’s decision to testify in the case saying, “I have to say it was one of the worst performances of a criminal defendant.  There was very little willingness to adhere to the truth while testifying.”
“Mr. Shibley took advantage of the community, disrupted and distraught by the pandemic, to try to enrich himself through fraud,” said U.S. Attorney Nick Brown.  “These funds were desperately needed to keep people employed by legitimate small businesses.  This fraud made it tougher for those truly in need.”
According to court documents and evidence presented at trial, Shibley, submitted 26 fraudulent PPP applications and 13 EIDL loan applications to federally insured financial institutions, other Small Business Administration (SBA)-approved lenders, and the SBA, in the names of businesses with no actual operations or by misrepresenting the business’s eligibility. In the applications, Shibley misrepresented the number of employees and payroll expenses in several applications and concealed his own criminal history.  To support the fraudulent applications, Shibley submitted fake tax documents and the names of purported employees who did not, in fact, work for the businesses for which Shibley claimed they worked.  Shibley was convicted by a jury of seven counts of wire fraud, three counts of bank fraud, and five counts of money laundering.
Shibley was ordered to pay $1,438,000 in restitution. Shibley’s license to practice medicine was suspended in 2020.
“As the American people suffered from the negative economic effects of the pandemic, Mr. Shibley chose to further this suffering by stealing funds meant to help small businesses stay afloat,” said Adam Jobes, Assistant Special Agent in Charge, IRS Criminal Investigation (IRS:CI), Seattle Field Office. “Contrary to his oath as a physician to cause no harm, Mr. Shibley caused great harm to those around him as he illegally pocketed resources meant for those who actually qualified for and needed those funds. Financial crimes are not victimless, and IRS:CI will continue to investigate and bring to justice those like Mr. Shibley who choose their own greed above the well-being of the public.”
“OIG is steadfast in our commitment to expose and bring to justice those who would seek to defraud SBA’s pandemic assistance programs,” said SBA OIG’s Special Agent in Charge Weston King. “OIG remains committed to rooting out bad actors and protecting the integrity of SBA programs. I want to thank the U.S. Attorney’s Office and our law enforcement partners for their dedication and pursuit of justice.”
SBA-OIG, the FBI’s Seattle Field Office, FDIC-OIG, TIGTA, IRS-CI, HSI, and HHS-OIG investigated the case.
Trial Attorney Laura Connelly of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Brian Werner of the Western District of Washington prosecuted the case.
The Fraud Section leads the Criminal Division’s prosecution of fraud schemes that exploit the PPP. Since the inception of the CARES Act, the Fraud Section has prosecuted over 167 defendants in more than 103 criminal cases and has seized over $75 million in cash proceeds derived from fraudulently obtained PPP funds, as well as numerous real estate properties and luxury items purchased with such proceeds.

Former Monmouth County Residents Charged with $3.3 Million Paycheck Protection Program Fraud Scheme
NEWARK, N.J. – Two former residents of Monmouth County, New Jersey, now residing in Frisco, Texas, were arrested today for their roles in fraudulently obtaining over $3 million in federal Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) payments, U.S. Attorney Philip R. Sellinger announced.
Jean E. Rabbitt, 51, formerly of Farmingdale, New Jersey, is charged by complaint with bank fraud, conspiracy to engage in monetary transactions in property derived from specified unlawful activity and engaging in monetary transactions in property derived from specified unlawful activity. Kevin Aguilar, 51, formerly of Farmingdale, is charged by complaint with conspiracy to engage in monetary transactions in property derived from specified unlawful activity and engaging in monetary transactions in property derived from specified unlawful activity. Rabbitt and Aguilar are scheduled to make their initial appearances by videoconference on March 3, 2022, before U.S. Magistrate Judge Kimberly C. Priest Johnson in the Eastern District of Texas.
According to documents filed in this case and statements made in court:
The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act is a federal law enacted on March 29, 2020, designed to provide emergency financial assistance to the millions of Americans suffering the economic effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. One source of relief provided by the CARES Act was the authorization of up to $349 billion in forgivable loans to small businesses for job retention and certain other expenses, through the PPP. In April 2020, Congress authorized over $300 billion in additional PPP funding.
The PPP allows qualifying small businesses and other organizations to receive loans with a maturity of two years and an interest rate of 1 percent. PPP loan proceeds must be used by businesses on payroll costs, interest on mortgages, rent, and utilities. The PPP allows the interest and principal on the PPP loan to be forgiven if the business spends the loan proceeds on these expense items within a designated period of time after receiving the proceeds and uses at least a certain percentage of the PPP loan proceeds on payroll expenses.
Rabbitt submitted fraudulent PPP loan applications on behalf of four businesses that she controlled. The applications contained fraudulent representations to the lenders, including a Federal Home Loan Bank member, and the Small Business Administration (SBA), including fraudulent payroll records and tax records and false certifications as to the number of employees and gross revenue of Rabbitt’s businesses. According to IRS records, none of the purported tax documents that Rabbitt submitted to the PPP lenders were, in fact, filed with the IRS. Other government records showed that, contrary to the fraudulent payroll records and certifications, Rabbitt’s businesses had not in fact paid wages to any employees. Based on Rabbitt’s alleged misrepresentations in the loan applications, Rabbitt’s businesses received approximately $3.33 million in federal COVID-19 emergency relief funds meant for distressed small businesses.
After Rabbitt’s businesses received the PPP loans through the fraudulent applications, Aguilar created sham payroll companies. Rabbitt then wrote checks from Rabbitt’s businesses to the sham payroll companies, falsely indicating on each check that the payments were for payroll. Rabbitt and Aguilar then transferred funds from the sham payroll companies to other companies that Aguilar created. Aguilar and Rabbitt then used the funds to purchase residential properties in Sherman, Texas, and to pay for personal expenses.
Rabbitt also made false and fraudulent statements and used falsified and fraudulent documents in support of applications for forgiveness of certain of the PPP loans. Based on Rabbitt’s false and fraudulent certifications and documents, the SBA paid more than $2 million dollars to lenders in connection with the fraudulent PPP loans Rabbitt obtained.
Each count of bank fraud carries a maximum penalty of 30 years in prison and a fine of $1 million. Each count of conspiracy to engage in monetary transactions in property derived from specified unlawful activity and engaging in monetary transactions in property derived from specified unlawful activity carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison. The conspiracy to engage in monetary transactions in property derived from specified unlawful activity and engaging in monetary transactions in property derived from specified unlawful activity carry a maximum fine of $250,000 or twice the gross gain to the defendant or gross loss to the victim, whichever is greatest. The court may impose an alternate fine of not more than twice the amount of the criminally derived property involved in the transaction.

On May 17, 2021, the Attorney General established the COVID-19 Fraud Enforcement Task Force to marshal the resources of the Department of Justice in partnership with agencies across government to enhance efforts to combat and prevent pandemic-related fraud. The Task Force bolsters efforts to investigate and prosecute the most culpable domestic and international criminal actors and assists agencies tasked with administering relief programs to prevent fraud by, among other methods, augmenting and incorporating existing coordination mechanisms, identifying resources and techniques to uncover fraudulent actors and their schemes, and sharing and harnessing information and insights gained from prior enforcement efforts.

Massachusetts Man Convicted of COVID-19 Relief Fraud
A federal jury convicted a Massachusetts man for submitting fraudulent loan applications seeking more than $13 million in forgivable Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (SBA) under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act.
According to evidence presented at trial, Elijah Majak Buoi, 40, of Winchester, submitted six fraudulent PPP loan applications on behalf of his company Sosuda Tech LLC (Sosuda) to four different SBA-approved lenders. In each loan application, Buoi misrepresented the number of employees and payroll expenses. Buoi also submitted fraudulent IRS tax forms in support of his applications. The evidence at trial showed that Sosuda was a startup company with no U.S.-based payroll and no U.S.-based employees. As a result of his scheme, Buoi obtained a $2 million PPP loan. The government recovered approximately $1.97 million of the loan funds.
Buoi was convicted of four counts of wire fraud and one count of making a false statement to a financial institution. He is scheduled to be sentenced on June 16, and faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison for each wire fraud conviction and 30 years in prison for making false statements to a financial institution. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.

Romanian National Sentenced to Five Years in Federal Prison for Bank Fraud and Wire Fraud Conspiracy Related to a Scheme to Steal Checks Intended for Religious Institutions from the Mail,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/romanian-national-sentenced-five-years-federal-prison-bank-fraud,"February 24, 2022",2022,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Romanian National Sentenced to Five Years in Federal Prison for Bank Fraud and Wire Fraud Conspiracy Related to a Scheme to Steal Checks Intended for Religious Institutions from the Mail
Defendant Participated in a Conspiracy That Stole more than 3,000 Checks from Religious Institutions
Greenbelt , Maryland – U.S. District Judge Theodore D. Chuang sentenced Romanian national Mateus Vaduva, age 29, of Baltimore, Maryland, and Florida yesterday to five years in federal prison, followed by five years of supervised release, for conspiracy to commit bank fraud and wire fraud, in connection with a scheme to steal donation checks intended for religious institutions from the mail.  Judge Chuang also ordered Mateus Vaduva to pay restitution in the full amount of the victims’ losses, which is $1,320,885.84 and entered a forfeiture money judgment in the amount of $79,551.07, equal to the proceeds Vaduva obtained as a result of the conspiracy.
The sentence was announced by United States Attorney for the District of Maryland Erek L. Barron; Acting Postal Inspector in Charge Greg L. Torbenson of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service - Washington Division; Special Agent in Charge James R. Mancuso of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Baltimore; Acting Special Agent in Charge Quenton Sallows, of the Mid-Atlantic Region, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC-OIG); Chief Marcus Jones of the Montgomery County Police Department; Chief Toni Dezomits of the Cary, North Carolina, Police Department; and Sheriff Dusty Rhoades of the Williamson County, Tennessee, Sheriff’s Office.
According to his guilty plea, beginning in June 2018 to January 2021, Vaduva and his co-conspirators conspired to steal checks from the U.S. mail intended for religious institutions and deposit the illegally obtained funds into multiple fraudulent bank accounts at various victim financial institutions. Conspirators, including Vaduva, conducted the thefts by driving to roadside mailboxes of churches and other religious institutions and removing the mail, specifically targeting donation checks.
As part of the scheme to defraud, Vaduva and other co-conspirators fraudulently opened bank accounts at victim financial institutions under false identities. Conspiracy members often opened fictitious bank accounts with the aid of a conspiracy member that was an employee at one of the victim financial institutions. In addition, Vaduva and his co-conspirators used at least two extended family members who were minors to assist in the account openings.
Vaduva and co-conspirators then withdrew cash from the fraudulent bank accounts through ATMs and spent the illegally obtained proceeds using debit cards associated with the bank accounts.
Throughout the scheme to defraud, Vaduva personally deposited at least approximately 126 stolen checks totaling at least approximately $79,551.07. In total, co-conspirators deposited at least 3,067 stolen checks from Maryland, North Carolina, Virginia, and elsewhere, totaling at least approximately $1,307,484.23.  Vaduva admitted that based on the length, scope, and type of involvement in the scheme and his relationship with other conspirators, more than $550,000, but less than $1.5 million in actual and intended loss was foreseeable to Vaduva.
Co-conspirators Daniel Velcu, age 44; Marian Unguru, age 37; Marius Vaduva, age 27; and Vali Unguru, age 19, all of Baltimore, Maryland, previously pled guilty to conspiracy to commit bank fraud and wire fraud and are awaiting sentencing.  Nicolae Gindac, age 53, of Dania Beach, Florida pled guilty to the same charge and was sentenced to 54 months in federal prison.
United States Attorney Erek L. Barron commended the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, HSI, the FDIC Office of Inspector General, the Montgomery County Police Department, the Cary (North Carolina) Police Department, and the Williamson County (Tennessee) Sheriff’s Office for their work in the investigation. Mr. Barron thanked Assistant U.S. Attorney Elizabeth Wright, who is prosecuting the case.

Queens Man Admits Orchestrating $653 Million Money Laundering Conspiracy, Operating Unlicensed Money Transmitting Business, and Bribing Bank Employees
NEWARK, N.J. – A Queens, New York, man today admitted his role in coordinating a $653 million money laundering conspiracy, operating an unlicensed money transmitting business, and bribing bank employees in connection with financial transactions, U.S. Attorney Philip R. Sellinger announced.
Da Ying Sze, 43, pleaded guilty before U.S. District Judge Esther Salas in Newark federal court to an information charging him with one count of conspiring to commit money laundering, one count of operating and aiding and abetting the operation of an unlicensed money transmitting business, and one count of corruptly giving anything of value to an employee of a financial institution in connection with financial transactions.
“The defendant in this case laundered a staggering amount of money,” U.S. Attorney Sellinger said. “Neither money laundering, the narcotics distribution that funded it, nor the bribery of a financial institution that facilitated the money laundering will be tolerated. A broad cross section of federal and local enforcement partners dismantled this sophisticated money laundering operation.”
“Today's announcement demonstrates that criminals who launder illegitimate profits can't evade detection from IRS Criminal Investigation and our law enforcement partners,” Michael Montanez, Special Agent in Charge IRS Criminal Investigation Newark Field Office, said. “This guilty plea is a significant step toward holding the defendant accountable for his role in conspiring to hide hundreds of millions of dollars gained from narcotics distribution.”
“The money laundering discovered during this investigation allows drug traffickers to expand their operations throughout the U.S. and around the world,” Susan A. Gibson, Special Agent in Charge of the Drug Enforcement Administration’s New Jersey Division, said. “The actions of DA Ying Sze contribute to high number of overdose fatalities across the country. The men and women of DEA, along with our law enforcement partners, work tirelessly to disrupt the flow of illicit narcotics proceeds to those drug organizations looking to flood our streets with deadly poison.”
According to documents filed in this case and statements made in court:
From 2016 through 2021, Sze laundered more than $653.3 million in cash, consisting of narcotics and other illicit proceeds, utilizing a variety of financial institutions and methods. Sze routinely accepted illicit proceeds in cash and deposited the cash into financial institutions in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and elsewhere, utilizing bank accounts in the names of shell companies and conspirators. Sze then further obfuscated the source of the illegal cash by purchasing official bank checks, writing personal and business checks, and making international and domestic wires to transfer the illegal cash to thousands of individuals and entities in the United States, China, Hong Kong, and elsewhere. For his services, Sze received a fee of approximately 1 to 2 percent of the cash laundered.
From 2020 through 2021, Sze routinely provided gift cards and other things of value to employees of at least one financial institution in connection with financial transactions, seeking to corruptly influence financial institution employees to provide Sze with special benefits and to avoid suspicion and reporting of his unusual financial transactions. In 2020 and 2021, Sze provided at least $57,000 in gifts to financial institution employees in connection with financial transactions, and made millions of dollars of profits in connection with such financial transactions.
The charge of money laundering conspiracy carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a fine of $250,000 or twice the amount involved in the offense, whichever is greater. The charge of operating and aiding and abetting the operation of an illegal money transmitting business carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a fine of $250,000, or twice the amount involved in the offense, whichever is greatest. The charge of bank bribery carries a maximum penalty of 30 years in prison and a fine of $1 million, or three times the value of the thing given, whichever is greatest. Sentencing is scheduled for June 28, 2022.
U.S. Attorney Sellinger credited special agents and task force officers of IRS - Criminal Investigation, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Michael Montanez in Newark; special agents and task force officers of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, New Jersey Division, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Susan A. Gibson; the Morristown, New Jersey, Police Department, under the direction of Police Chief Darnell Richardson; the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation – Office of Inspector General, New York Division, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Patricia Tarasca; and the New York City Police Department, under the direction of Commissioner Keechant L. Sewell, with the investigation leading to today’s guilty plea.

Twin Brothers Facing Federal Charges for Allegedly Obtaining Over $1 Million in Covid-19 Loans and Unemployment Insurance Benefits
One of the Defendants Allegedly Used Illegally Obtained Funds to Purchase and Exchange Crypto Currency
Greenbelt , Maryland – A federal criminal complaint has been filed charging Jerry Phillips, age 24, of Temple Hills, Maryland, for the federal charges of wire fraud and aggravated identity theft; and Jaleel Phillips, age 24, of Temple Hills, Maryland, for wire fraud, in relation to an alleged scheme to unlawfully obtain COVID-19 relief loans and unemployment benefits.
Jerry and Jaleel Phillips made their initial appearances today at 1:30 p.m. and 2:30 p.m.; respectively, in U.S. District Court in Greenbelt before U.S. Magistrate Judge Charles B. Day.
The criminal complaint was announced by United States Attorney for the District of Maryland Erek L. Barron; Acting Special Agent in Charge Quenton Sallows, of the Mid-Atlantic Region, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC-OIG); Acting Special Agent in Charge Troy W. Springer, of the Washington Regional Office, U.S. Department of Labor - Office of Inspector General; and Special Agent in Charge Darrell J. Waldon of the Internal Revenue Service - Criminal Investigation, Washington, D.C. Field Office.
According to the criminal complaint, IP addresses linked to Jaleel and Jerry Phillips were used to submit fraudulent Paycheck Protection Program loan applications (PPP), Economic Injury Disaster loan applications (EIDL), and unemployment insurance claims resulting in $1 million in received funds.
As stated in the affidavit in support of the criminal complaint, the Phillips brothers allegedly created fictitious aliases, used the personal identifying information of real people, and used out of business or fake corporate entities to apply for EIDL and PPP loans, and unemployment benefits.
Further, the complaint alleges that the brothers created several financial and email accounts under aliases, including “Kenneth Williams,” “Allen Gator,” and “Jamal Hopkins.”  The aliases were supported by fake Maryland driver’s licenses, social security numbers, and birth dates.  The complaint further alleges that after receiving the fraudulently obtained funds, the defendants used the funds to purchase a 2020 Camaro, furniture, home improvement items and services, and made many other purchases. Significant funds were also transferred between the various financial accounts established in the aliases’ names.  Additionally, the criminal complaint alleges that the defendants used several fraudulent Maryland driver’s licenses to create multiple accounts in popular digital currency exchange platforms.
If convicted, Jerry Phillips and Jaleel Phillips face a maximum sentence of 20 years in federal prison for wire fraud.  Jerry Phillips faces an additional two years in federal prison consecutive to any other sentence imposed for aggravated identity theft.  Actual sentences for federal crimes are typically less than the maximum penalties. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after taking into account the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.
A criminal complaint is not a finding of guilt.  An individual charged by criminal complaint is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty at some later criminal proceedings.

Three Men Sentenced for $2.7 Million COVID-19 Relief Fraud Scheme
Three men were sentenced yesterday in the Middle District of North Carolina for fraudulently seeking over $2.7 million in Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans and Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDLs) guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (SBA) under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act.
Joseph Marsell Cartlidge, 30, of Greensboro, North Carolina, was sentenced to 72 months in prison; David Christopher Redfern, 32, of Trinity, North Carolina, was sentenced to 60 months in prison; and Eric Alexander McMiller, 30, of Chicago, Illinois, was sentenced to 66 months in prison. Each defendant was also ordered to pay $498,657 in restitution.
According to court documents, Cartlidge, Redfern and McMiller joined a scheme led by James Stote, who with others, recruited the defendants to apply for fraudulent PPP loans for registered businesses, with the understanding and agreement they would provide a portion of the PPP loan proceeds to their recruiter. Between May and June 2020, the defendants submitted fraudulent PPP loan applications misrepresenting the number of employees and the average monthly payroll expenses of the defendants’ various businesses. The defendants submitted false tax and bank records in support of their loan applications. The defendants also independently applied for fraudulent EIDLs and misrepresented the number of employees, gross revenues, and costs of goods sold for each business. In total, the defendants sought over $2.7 million in PPP loans and EIDL funds. The defendants then used the loan proceeds for their own personal benefits, including for luxury purchases and cash withdrawals.
Stote pleaded guilty on Dec. 15, 2021, to conspiracy to commit wire fraud in the Northern District of Ohio.
Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Polite Jr. of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division; U.S. Attorney Sandra J.

Chicago Attorney Convicted on False Statement and Tax Offenses in Connection With Funds Received From Failed Bank,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/chicago-attorney-convicted-false-statement-and-tax-offenses,"February 14, 2022",2022,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Chicago Attorney Convicted on False Statement and Tax Offenses in Connection With Funds Received From Failed Bank
CHICAGO — A federal jury today convicted a Chicago attorney on false statement and tax offenses in connection with funds he received from the failed Washington Federal Bank for Savings.
PATRICK D. THOMPSON, 52, of Chicago, was found guilty on all seven counts against him, including five counts of willfully filing a false income tax return and two counts of knowingly making a false statement to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.  Each false statement count is punishable by a maximum sentence of 30 years in federal prison, while each tax count is punishable by up to three years.  U.S. District Judge Franklin U. Valderrama set sentencing for July 6, 2022.
The conviction was announced by John R. Lausch, Jr., United States Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois; Jay N. Lerner, Inspector General of the FDIC’s Office of Inspector General; Justin Campbell, Special Agent-in-Charge of IRS Criminal Investigation in Chicago; Emmerson Buie, Jr., Special Agent-in-Charge of the Chicago Field Office of the FBI; Catherine Huber, Special Agent-in-Charge of the Central Region of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, Office of Inspector General; Sally Luttrell, Assistant Inspector for Investigations of the Department of the Treasury, Office of Inspector General; and Kathryn B. Richards, Chicago Housing Authority Inspector General.  Valuable assistance was provided by the City of Chicago Inspector General’s Office.  The government is represented by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Michelle Petersen, Brian Netols, and Jeremy Daniel.
According to evidence presented at trial, Thompson from 2011 to 2014 received $219,000 from Chicago-based Washington Federal via a purported loan and other unsecured payments.  He made one re-payment on the loan but then stopped making payments, and he failed to pay interest on the funds he received.  Washington Federal was shut down in 2017 after the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency determined it was insolvent and had at least $66 million in nonperforming loans.  When the FDIC, as successor in interest to Washington Federal, attempted to obtain repayment from Thompson in 2018, he falsely stated that he owed only $110,000 and that those funds were for home improvement.  In reality, Thompson knew he had actually received $219,000 in three separate installments – none of which went towards home improvements – and that $110,000 of it was paid by the bank directly to Thompson’s law firm as Thompson’s capital contribution.
The tax charges stemmed from Thompson falsely representing on five years of income taxes that he was entitled to a mortgage interest deduction for interest payments made on money he received from Washington Federal, even though he knew the loan was not a mortgage loan and he did not make interest payments as reported on those returns.

PROVIDENCE, R.I. – A Warwick man charged with executing a scheme to defraud the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), an element of the CARES Act passed by Congress on March 29, 2020, in response to the national crisis brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, was sentenced in federal court in Providence today to three years of supervised release, the first six months of which are to be served in home confinement with electronic monitoring, announced United States Attorney Zachary A. Cunha.
David Andrew Butziger, 53, previously admitted to the court that he, along with co-conspirator David Adler Staveley, 54, of Andover, MA, sought to defraud the PPP by seeking $543,959 in forgivable loans guaranteed by the SBA, claiming to have dozens of employees earning wages at four business, when, in fact, there were no employees working at any of them.
Staveley pleaded guilty on May 17, 2021, to conspiracy to commit bank fraud and failure to appear in court as required. He was sentenced by U.S. District Court Judge Mary S. McElroy on October 7, 2021, to fifty-six months in federal prison to be followed by three years of federal supervised release.
Three weeks after appearing in U.S. District Court in May 2020, and released to home detention with electronic monitoring, Staveley removed his electronic monitoring device, staged his own suicide, and fled. Staveley left suicide notes with associates and left his wallet in his unlocked car that he parked along the ocean in Massachusetts. Further investigation determined that between May 26 and July 23, 2020, Staveley, who was to have appeared in federal court on June 2, 2020, traveled to various states using false identities and stolen license plates. He was apprehended by the United States Marshals Service in Alpharetta, GA., on July 23, 2020.
Staveley’s co-conspirator, Butziger, pleaded guilty on October 18, 2020, to conspiracy to commit bank fraud, admitting to the court that he himself sought a bank loan for $105,381.50 to pay seven employees at an unincorporated entity he called Dock Wireless. According to the government’s evidence, Dock Wireless had no employees, and no wages were ever paid by the company.
Butziger also admitted that he conspired with Staveley to submit three fraudulent bank loan applications for SBA loans under the PPP totaling $438,577. The loans were to be used to pay employees at three restaurants Staveley claimed to own, Top of the Bay and Remington House in Warwick and On The Trax in Berlin, MA. According to government’s evidence, Staveley had no ownership interest in any of the business; none of them were open at the time; and there we no employees at time the loan applications were filed.
Today, Butziger was sentenced by U.S. District Court Judge McElroy to three years of supervised release, the first six months to be served in home confinement with electronic monitoring, and ordered to pay a fine of $5,000.
The cases were prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Lee H. Vilker.
The matter was investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation.
The Justice Department acknowledges and thanks the SBA Office of Inspector General and the FDIC, Office of Inspector General for their assistance in the investigation.

Bank CEO Stephen M. Calk Sentenced To One Year And One Day For Corruptly Soliciting A Presidential Administration Position In Exchange For Approving $16 Million In Loans,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/bank-ceo-stephen-m-calk-sentenced-one-year-and-one-day-corruptly,"February 7, 2022",2022,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Bank CEO Stephen M. Calk Sentenced To One Year And One Day For Corruptly Soliciting A Presidential Administration Position In Exchange For Approving $16 Million In Loans
Damian Williams, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, announced today that STEPHEN M. CALK was sentenced to one year and one day of imprisonment for corruptly using his position as the head of a federally-insured bank to issue millions of dollars in high-risk loans to Paul Manafort in exchange for personal benefit: CALK’s placement on the Donald J. Trump 2016 presidential campaign and assistance from Manafort in trying to obtain a senior position with the incoming presidential administration. On July 13, 2021, CALK was found guilty of financial institution bribery and conspiracy to commit financial institution bribery following a three-week trial before U.S. District Judge Lorna G. Schofield, who also imposed today’s sentence.
U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said: “Stephen Calk abused his position as the CEO of a federally-insured bank to try to buy himself prestige and power by trading millions of dollars in high-risk loans for influence with a presidential campaign and consideration for positions at the highest levels of the Defense Department.  Today’s sentence sends the message that those who corrupt federally regulated financial institutions will be held to account.”
As reflected in the Indictment, documents previously filed in the case, and evidence introduced at trial:
CALK, The Federal Savings Bank, and Paul Manafort
STEPHEN M. CALK was the chairman and chief executive officer of The Federal Savings Bank, a federal savings association headquartered in Chicago, Illinois, with an office in New York, New York.  The Bank was owned in its entirety by National Bancorp Holdings, a Chicago-based bank holding company, and CALK was the chairman, chief executive officer, and owner of approximately 67% of the holding company.
Paul Manafort was a lobbyist and political consultant.  Beginning in or about March 2016, Manafort held a senior role with Donald J. Trump’s 2016 presidential, and from June 2016 through August 2016, he served as chairman of the presidential campaign.  After Manafort’s formal role with the presidential campaign concluded in or about August 2016, Manafort continued to be informally involved in the campaign.  Beginning in or about November 2016, when Donald J. Trump was elected President of the United States, Manafort provided informal input to the presidential transition team.
The Corrupt Scheme
Between in or about July 2016 and January 2017, CALK engaged in a corrupt scheme to exploit his position as the head of the Bank and the holding company in an effort to secure a valuable personal benefit for himself, namely, Manafort’s assistance in obtaining for CALK a senior position in the presidential administration.  During this time period, Manafort sought millions of dollars in loans from the Bank.  CALK understood that Manafort urgently needed these loans in order to terminate or avoid foreclosure proceedings on multiple properties owned by Manafort and Manafort’s family.  Further, CALK believed that Manafort could use his influence with the presidential transition team to assist CALK in obtaining a senior administration position.
CALK thus sought to leverage his control over the Bank and the loans sought by Manafort to his personal advantage.  Specifically, CALK offered to, and did, cause the Bank and holding company to extend $16 million in loans to Manafort in exchange for Manafort’s requested assistance in obtaining a high-level position in the presidential administration.  For example, and while Manafort’s loans were pending approval, CALK provided Manafort with a ranked list of the governmental positions he desired, which started with Secretary of the Treasury, and was followed by Deputy Secretary of the Treasury, Secretary of Commerce, and Secretary of Defense, as well as 19 ambassadorships similarly ranked and starting with the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Italy.
In approving these loans to Manafort, CALK was aware of significant red flags regarding Manafort’s ability to repay the loans, such as his history of defaulting on prior loans.  Moreover, given the size of the loans, Manafort’s debt became the single largest lending relationship at the Bank.  In order to enable the Bank to issue these loans without violating the Bank’s legal limit on loans to a single borrower, CALK authorized a maneuver never before performed by the Bank, in which the holding company—which CALK also controlled—acquired a portion of the loans from the Bank.
During the same time period, Manafort provided CALK with valuable personal benefits. First , in or about the summer of 2016, during the presidential campaign—and just days after CALK and the rest of the Bank’s credit committee conditionally approved a proposed $9.5 million loan to Manafort — Manafort appointed CALK to a prestigious economic advisory committee affiliated with the campaign.  And second , in or about late November and early December 2016—after Donald J. Trump had been elected President, after Manafort’s first loan from the Bank had been issued, and while a second set of loans worth $6.5 million sought by Manafort was pending approval by the Bank— Manafort used his influence with the presidential transition team to assist Calk, recommending CALK for an administration position.  Due to Manafort’s efforts, CALK was formally interviewed for the position of Under Secretary of the Army on January 10, 2017 at the presidential transition team’s principal offices in New York, New York.  CALK was not ultimately hired.
To conceal the unlawful nature of his scheme, CALK made false and misleading statements to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency regarding the loans to Manafort.  For example, CALK falsely stated to the OCC regulators that he had not known that the Manafort’s properties had been in foreclosure prior to issuing the loans.  CALK also stated that he had never desired a position in the presidential administration.
*                *                *
In addition to the prison term, CALK, 56, was sentenced to two years of supervised release and 800 hours of community service.  CALK was also ordered to pay a $1 million fine on Count 1 and a $250,000 fine on Count 2.
Mr. Williams praised the outstanding investigative work of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s Office of Inspector General.
This case is being handled by the Office’s Public Corruption Unit.  Assistant U.S. Attorneys Paul M. Monteleoni, Hagan Scotten, Benet Kearney, Alexandra N. Rothman are in charge of the prosecution.

Somerset County Woman Charged with $1 Million Paycheck Protection Program and Economic Injury Disaster Loan Fraud Scheme,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/somerset-county-woman-charged-1-million-paycheck-protection,"January 31, 2022",2022,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Somerset County Woman Charged with $1 Million Paycheck Protection Program and Economic Injury Disaster Loan Fraud Scheme
NEWARK, N.J. – A Somerset County, New Jersey, woman was charged for her role in fraudulently obtaining over $1 million in federal Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans and Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL), U.S. Attorney Philip R. Sellinger announced today.
Nivah Garcis, 51, of North Plainfield, New Jersey, is charged by complaint with one count of bank fraud and one count of money laundering. She made her initial appearance by videoconference today before U.S. Magistrate Judge Edward S. Kiel and was released on $100,000 unsecured bond.
According to documents filed in this case and statements made in court:
Garcis submitted two fraudulent PPP loan applications to a lender on behalf of two purported businesses and three fraudulent EIDL loan applications to the Small Business Administration (SBA) on behalf of three purported businesses.
The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act is a federal law enacted on March 29, 2020, designed to provide emergency financial assistance to the millions of Americans suffering the economic effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. One source of relief provided by the CARES Act was the authorization of up to $349 billion in forgivable loans to small businesses for job retention and certain other expenses, through the PPP. In April 2020, Congress authorized over $300 billion in additional PPP funding.
The PPP allows qualifying small businesses and other organizations to receive loans with a maturity of two years and an interest rate of 1 percent. PPP loan proceeds must be used by businesses on payroll costs, interest on mortgages, rent, and utilities. The PPP allows the interest and principal on the PPP loan to be forgiven if the business spends the loan proceeds on these expense items within a designated period of time after receiving the proceeds and uses at least a certain percentage of the PPP loan proceeds on payroll expenses.
The applications Garcis submitted each allegedly contained fraudulent representations to the lender – a Federal Home Loan Bank member – and the SBA, including bogus federal tax documents purportedly from the IRS. Garcis also fabricated the existence of employees and wages paid through the purported businesses. According to IRS records, however, none of the purported tax documents that Garcis submitted in support of her loan applications were ever in fact filed with the IRS. Based on Garcis’s alleged misrepresentations, her loan applications for her purported businesses were approved for approximately $1.05 million in federal COVID-19 emergency relief funds meant for distressed small businesses. Garcis then used the proceeds for various personal expenses, including a BMW SUV.
The count of bank fraud carries a maximum penalty of 30 years in prison and a $1 million fine. The count of money laundering carries a maximum potential penalty of 10 years in prison and a maximum fine of $250,000 or twice the gross gain to the defendant or gross loss to the victim, whichever is greatest.
U.S. Attorney Sellinger credited special agents of the Social Security Administration, Office of the Inspector General, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Sharon MacDermott; special agents of IRS – Criminal Investigation, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Michael Montanez; special agents of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of New Jersey, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Thomas Mahoney; postal inspectors of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, under the direction of Acting Inspector in Charge Raimundo Marrero; special agents of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, Office of Inspector General, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Robert Manchak; special agents of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Office of Inspector General, under the direction of Acting Special Agent in Charge Stephen Donnelly; special agents of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation – Office of the Inspector General, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Patricia Tarasca in New York; and special agents of the Department of Homeland Security, Homeland Security Investigations, under the direction of Jason J.

Somerset County Man Charged with $860,000 Paycheck Protection Program and Economic Injury Disaster Loan Fraud Scheme
NEWARK, N.J. – A Somerset County, New Jersey, man was arrested today for his role in fraudulently obtaining over $860,000 in federal Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) and Economic Injury Disaster Loan payments (EIDL), U.S. Attorney Philip R. Sellinger announced.
Butherde Darius, 49, of North Plainfield, New Jersey, is charged by complaint with one count of bank fraud, one count of wire fraud, and four counts of money laundering. Darius is scheduled to make his initial appearance by videoconference this afternoon before U.S. Magistrate Judge Michael A. Hammer.
According to documents filed in this case and statements made in court:
The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act is a federal law enacted on March 29, 2020, designed to provide emergency financial assistance to the millions of Americans suffering the economic effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. One source of relief provided by the CARES Act was the authorization of up to $349 billion in forgivable loans to small businesses for job retention and certain other expenses, through the PPP.

The PPP allows the interest and principal on the PPP loan to be forgiven if the business spends the loan proceeds on these expense items within a designated period of time after receiving the proceeds and uses at least a certain percentage of the PPP loan proceeds on payroll expenses.
Darius submitted fraudulent PPP and EIDL loan applications on behalf of his purported business, Fabulous Appetizers LLC. The applications contained fraudulent representations to the lenders, including a federal home loan member bank, and the Small Business Administration (SBA), including bogus tax information from the IRS and certifications as to the number of employees and gross revenue of Darius’s business. According to IRS records, many of the purported tax documents Darius submitted were never in fact filed with the IRS and Darius fabricated the existence of employees and the revenue of his business. Based on Darius’s alleged misrepresentations in his loan applications, he received approximately $862,000 in federal COVID-19 emergency relief funds meant for distressed small businesses. Darius then spent the proceeds on personal expenses, including hotels and airfare, and made cash withdrawals of over $58,000.
The count of bank fraud carries a maximum penalty of 30 years in prison and a fine of $1 million; each count of wire fraud carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison; and each count of money laundering carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison. Both the wire fraud and money laundering counts carry a maximum fine of $250,000 or twice the gross gain to the defendant or gross loss to the victim, whichever is greatest.

Two Loan Brokers and One Bank Loan Officer Charged in Bank Fraud Scheme
Defendants agree to plead guilty to charging borrowers fees for fraudulent loan applications they submitted using fabricated information
BOSTON – Three men were charged yesterday, and have agreed to plead guilty, in connection with a scheme to defraud a Massachusetts-based bank and the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA).
Ted Capodilupo, 56, of South Easton; Joseph Masci, 70, of Boston; and Brian Ferris, 43, of Braintree, were charged with one count each of conspiracy to commit bank fraud.
According to the charging documents, between 2015 and 2018, Capodilupo, Masci and Ferris agreed to defraud the bank and the SBA by submitting fraudulent loan applications to the bank, which administered the SBA’s small business express loan program, to secure bank loans guaranteed by the SBA. Specifically, it is alleged that Capodilupo and Masci, who operated a loan brokerage business, submitted dozens of fraudulent loan applications to the bank on behalf of borrowers ineligible for traditional business loans. These loan applications misrepresented, among other things, the identity of the real loan recipients and the businesses for which the loans were sought.
Capodilupo and Masci also allegedly fabricated fderal tax forms submitted in support of the fraudulent loan applications, falsified applicant signatures and falsely indicated that no broker had assisted in preparing or referring the loan applications. Capodilupo and Masci allegedly charged borrowers fees for obtaining these fraudulent loans. It is alleged that Ferris, who worked as a loan officer at the bank, caused the bank to issue loans for which Capodilupo and Masci submitted applications and received a kickback from Capodilupo and Masci of approximately $500 per loan. The alleged scheme generated approximately $270,000 in fees for Capodilupo and Masci. Many of the loans that the bank issued as a result of the fraudulent applications ultimately defaulted, resulting in substantial losses to the bank.
The charge of conspiracy to commit bank fraud provides for a sentence of up to 30 years in prison; five years of supervised release; a fine of up to $1 million or twice the gross gain or loss, whichever is greater; restitution; and forfeiture. Sentences are imposed by a federal district court judge based upon the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.
United States Attorney Rachael S. Rollins; Patricia Tarasca, Special Agent in Charge of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC-OIG), New York Region; Joseph R. Bonavolonta, Special Agent in Charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Boston Office; Stephen Donnelly, Acting Special Agent-in-Charge, Eastern Region, Office of Inspector General for the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection; and Mark Hines, Assistant Inspector General for Investigations for the SBA, Office of Inspector General, made the announcement. Assistant U.S. Attorney David M. Holcomb of Rollins’ Securities, Financial & Cyber Fraud Unit is prosecuting the case.
The details contained in the charging documents are allegations. The defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.

Huntington Woman Pleads Guilty to Role in Nigerian Fraud Scheme
HUNTINGTON, W.Va. -- A Huntington woman pleaded guilty today in connection with her role as a money mule in a Nigerian fraud scheme that scammed money from individuals, many of whom were elderly.
According to court documents and statements made during the plea hearing, Patricia Dudding, 69, acted as a money mule for a Nigerian scammer. In May 2018, Dudding met “Lucas” online and although they never actually met in person, Dudding and Lucas communicated frequently by email and text messages.   Dudding set up numerous bank accounts in her name at several different banks that she would use to wire and receive fraudulent funds.  Dudding received numerous deposits in those bank accounts from individuals located in the United States and abroad.  She, and unnamed co-conspirators, would then transfer these funds to bank accounts located in Nigeria. To further the scheme, Dudding admittedly would make false and fraudulent representations to the financial institutions to make it appear that the wire transfers were being sent for legitimate purposes. On April 26, 2019, Dudding sent a wire transfer of $39,000 from her account to an individual in Montana. Upon questioning by a bank employee, Dudding lied about the wire transfer to aid Lucas in completing the transfer of funds to the designated recipient in Montana.
Over the course of the scheme, Dudding withdrew victim funds for her personal benefit. Dudding used the funds to pay her utility bills, satellite television service, groceries, drug store purchases, gasoline purchases, department store purchases, restaurants and took numerous cash withdrawals.
Dudding pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting an unlawful monetary transaction and faces up to 10 years in prison when she is sentenced on April 25, 2022.  As part of her plea agreement, Dudding has agreed to pay $1,788,589.24 in restitution.
United States Attorney Will Thompson made the announcement and commended the investigative work of the United States Secret Service, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) – Office of Inspector General and the South Charleston Police Department conducted the investigation.
United States District Judge Robert C. Chambers presided over the hearing. Assistant United States Attorney Kathleen Robeson is prosecuting the case.

Foreign National Pleads Guilty to Conspiracy to Commit Bank Fraud and Wire Fraud in Relation to Multiple Religious Institutions
Defendant Participated in a Conspiracy That Stole more than 3,000 Checks from Religious Institutions in North Carolina, Virginia and was Ordered to Pay over $1,300,000.00 in Restitution
Greenbelt , Maryland – Marius Vaduva, age 27, of Baltimore, Maryland, pleaded guilty yesterday to conspiracy to commit bank fraud and wire fraud. As part of his plea agreement, Vaduva will be ordered to pay at least $1,320,829.23 in restitution.
The guilty plea was announced by United States Attorney for the District of Maryland Erek L. Barron; Acting Postal Inspector in Charge Charles Wickersham of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service - Washington Division; Special Agent in Charge James R. Mancuso of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Baltimore; Special Agent in Charge Shimon R. Richmond of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of Inspector General (FDIC-OIG); Chief Marcus Jones of the Montgomery County Police Department; Chief Toni Dezomits of the Cary, North Carolina, Police Department; and Sheriff Dusty Rhoades of the Williamson County, Tennessee, Sheriff’s Office.
According to his guilty plea, beginning in June 2018 to January 2021, Vaduva and his co-conspirators conspired to steal checks from the U.S. mail intended for religious institutions and deposit the illegally obtained funds into multiple fraudulent bank accounts at various victim financial institutions. Conspirators, including Vaduva, conducted the thefts by driving to roadside mailboxes of churches and other religious institutions and removing the mail, specifically targeting donation checks.
As part of the scheme to defraud, Vaduva and other co-conspirators fraudulently opened bank accounts at victim financial institutions under false identities. Conspiracy members often opened fictitious bank accounts with the aid of a conspiracy member that was an employee at one of the victim financial institutions. In addition, Vaduva and his co-conspirators used at least two extended family members who were minors to assist in the account openings.
Vaduva and co-conspirators then withdrew cash from the fraudulent bank accounts through ATMs and spent the illegally obtained proceeds using debit cards associated with the bank accounts.

"Columbus Woman Guilty of Wire Fraud, Stole $240k from Non-Profits",https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/columbus-woman-guilty-wire-fraud-stole-240k-non-profits,"December 21, 2021",2021,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Columbus Woman Guilty of Wire Fraud, Stole $240k from Non-Profits
COLUMBUS, Ga. – A Columbus resident and teacher who volunteered for two local non-profit organizations pleaded guilty to wire fraud resulting from an FDIC-led investigation.
Trenna Denise Trice, 59, of Columbus, pleaded guilty to wire fraud before U.S. District Clay Land on Monday, Dec. 20. Trice is facing a maximum twenty years in prison to be followed by three years of supervised release and a $250,000 fine. Sentencing is scheduled for March 29, 2022.
“Trenna Trice abused the trust of two non-profits, a small business and many individual citizens when she choose to steal money intended for others to fund her gambling addiction,” said U.S. Attorney Peter D. Leary. “I commend the FDIC-OIG investigators who unraveled her web of lies through their extensive investigation. Our office, along with our law enforcement partners, will do everything in our power to bring fraudsters to justice.”
“The criminal conduct in this case is even more egregious because Ms. Trice is a public servant, occupied a position of trust in charitable organizations, and stole from those organizations – all while pocketing the funds for her personal use,” said FDIC OIG Special Agent in Charge Kyle A. Myles. “The FDIC Office of Inspector General is committed to working with our law enforcement partners to investigate matters of fraud which impact both the banking system and the community as a whole.”
According to court documents, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation-Office of the Inspector General (FDIC-OIG) initiated an investigation into the financial activities of Trice in May 2019, following reports of significant casino losses sourced by an unidentified income stream. The investigation into possible sources of income for her casino activity revealed that her sole source of income was working as a teacher for the Muscogee County School District (MCSD). Prior to teaching, she worked for a dental office and she worked as a volunteer campaign coordinator for the Columbus branch of the United Negro College Fund (UNCF) from 2005 – 2017.
Trice was responsible for organizing the annual Columbus Mayor’s Masked Ball, UNCF’s primary fundraising activity. Her duties included collecting cash, credit card contributions and check payments for donations and ticket sales. During the course of the investigation, agents determined that while the larger contribution checks from bigger sponsorship companies had made their way to UNCF, Trice diverted numerous smaller contributions for her own personal use. UNCF ended their relationship with Trice in 2017, following questions regarding financial irregularities that were indicative of embezzlement. It was later discovered that Trice had also
been terminated by the dental office following similar allegations. Trice was also collecting donations for a nonprofit corporation known as SAMARC run by two former NBA basketball players who conduct an annual basketball camp for underprivileged kids in Columbus.
In total, agents identified 109 checks and 265 credit card transactions fraudulently deposited into Trice’s own accounts without authorization. Trice told investigators she had a crippling gambling addiction for the last decade and the money was stolen to fuel her gambling addiction and compensate for her gambling losses. Trice said she was always careful to conceal her actions by using only outside ATMs to deposit checks with fraudulent endorsements and by changing the settings in the Square App to disguise that she was the actual recipient of a donation intended for others. In total, with checks and credit cards, Trice is known to have stolen $240,259 from the following victims: UNCF ($162,044), the dental office ($70,231), SAMARC ($7,784) and the Georgia Dental Society ($200).
This case was investigated by the FDIC-OIG.

College Football Player Arrested on Federal Charges of Orchestrating Fraudulent Scheme to Obtain COVID-Related Jobless Benefits,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/college-football-player-arrested-federal-charges-orchestrating,"December 20, 2021",2021,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

College Football Player Arrested on Federal Charges of Orchestrating Fraudulent Scheme to Obtain COVID-Related Jobless Benefits
LOS ANGELES – A college football player was taken into custody this morning on federal charges alleging he orchestrated a scheme that fraudulently sought hundreds of thousands of dollars in COVID-related unemployment benefits.
Abdul-Malik McClain, 22, who currently attends school in Jackson, Mississippi, surrendered to federal law enforcement this morning in Los Angeles before being arraigned this afternoon in United States District Court.
A federal grand jury indictment returned on December 16 and unsealed this afternoon charges McClain with 10 counts of mail fraud and two counts of aggravated identity theft. McClain, who was residing in Los Angeles in 2020 during the alleged scheme, pleaded not guilty to the charges against him and was ordered released on a $20,000 bond.
According to the indictment, while a member of his university’s football team, McClain organized and assisted a group of other football players in filing fraudulent claims for unemployment benefits, including under the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) program established by Congress in response to the pandemic’s economic fallout. The indictment alleges that the claims – which were filed with the California Employment Development Department (EDD), the administrator of the state’s unemployment insurance (UI) benefit program – contained false information about the football players’ supposed prior employment, pandemic-related job loss, and job-seeking efforts in California.
The indictment alleges that the false statements in the UI applications led EDD to authorize Bank of America to mail debit cards to the football players. Those debit cards were loaded with at least hundreds of dollars, and sometimes thousands of dollars, in unemployment benefits, which the recipients used to make cash withdrawals at ATMs and to fund personal expenses. In some cases, McClain sought and obtained a cut for helping others file fraudulent UI applications.
McClain and his co-schemers also allegedly filed applications in their own names, in the names of other friends and associates, and in the names of identity theft victims. According to the indictment, these claims also falsely stated that the claimants were self-employed workers, including athletic trainers and tutors, who had lost work in California as a result of the pandemic. These allegedly false claims also induced EDD to authorize Bank of America to issue debit cards in the names of the claimants. The indictment alleges that McClain and his co-schemers caused those cards to be mailed to addresses where they could collect the mail.
McClain allegedly caused at least three dozen fraudulent applications to be filed with EDD during the summer of 2020. According to the indictment, those fraudulent applications sought at least $903,688 in PUA benefits and led the EDD to pay out at least $227,736.
An indictment contains allegations that a defendant has committed a crime. Every defendant is presumed to be innocent until and unless proven guilty in court.
During today’s arraignment, McClain was ordered to stand trial on February 15.
Each mail fraud count carries a statutory maximum sentence of 20 years in federal prison. The aggravated identity theft counts carry a two-year mandatory prison sentence consecutive to any sentence imposed on the mail fraud counts.
The FBI; the U.S. Department of Labor, Office of Inspector General; the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of Inspector General; the U.S. Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration; and the Social Security Administration, Office of Inspector General investigated this matter. The university, called “University 1” in the indictment, cooperated in this investigation.
Assistant United States Attorney Kerry L. Quinn of the Major Frauds Section is prosecuting this case.
On May 17, 2021, the Attorney General established the COVID-19 Fraud Enforcement Task Force to marshal the resources of the Department of Justice in partnership with agencies across government to enhance efforts to combat and prevent pandemic-related fraud. The Task Force bolsters efforts to investigate and prosecute the most culpable domestic and international criminal actors and assists agencies tasked with administering relief programs to prevent fraud by, among other methods, augmenting and incorporating existing coordination mechanisms, identifying resources and techniques to uncover fraudulent actors and their schemes, and sharing and harnessing information and insights gained from prior enforcement efforts.

Four Executives Sentenced for SBA Fraud Scheme Spanning 13 Years,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/four-executives-sentenced-sba-fraud-scheme-spanning-13-years,"December 17, 2021",2021,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Four Executives Sentenced for SBA Fraud Scheme Spanning 13 Years
Four Indianapolis-area small business lending executives, all of whom worked for Banc-Serv Partners LLC (Banc-Serv) — a defunct lending service provider — were sentenced this month in the Southern District of Indiana for a 13-year conspiracy to defraud the Small Business Administration (SBA) in connection with its programs to guarantee loans made to small businesses.
Kerri Agee, 46, of Carmel, Banc-Serv’s former president, founder, and owner, was sentenced to 68 months in prison; Kelly Isley, 41, of Westfield, Banc-Serv’s former chief operating officer, was sentenced to 57 months; Chad Griffin, 48, of Carmel, Banc-Serv’s former chief marketing officer, was sentenced to 28 months; and Matthew Smith, 53, of Brownsburg, Banc-Serv’s co-founder and a former director of Bridge Business Bancorp, a lending institution that originated loans with Banc-Serv, was sentenced to 46 months. One additional co-conspirator, Nicole Smith, 44, of Indianapolis, is scheduled to be sentenced on Jan. 7, 2022. These defendants were convicted following a two-week jury trial in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana for the defendants. Agee, Isley, Griffin, and Nicole Smith were each convicted of one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud affecting a financial institution. Additionally, Agee was convicted of four counts of wire fraud affecting a financial institution, and Isley and Nicole Smith were convicted of two counts of wire fraud affecting a financial institution. Matthew Smith was convicted of one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud.
According to court documents and the evidence produced at trial, the defendants fraudulently obtained SBA-guaranteed loans on behalf of their clients, knowing that the loans did not meet SBA’s guidelines and requirements for the guarantees. The evidence at trial proved that from approximately 2004 until October 2017, the defendants helped originate SBA loans through Banc-Serv on behalf of various financial institutions and other lenders. On multiple occasions, they fraudulently obtained SBA guarantees for loans they knew to be ineligible. They did so by, among other things, knowingly misrepresenting what the loans would be used for, concealing disqualifying facts about the borrowers, and unlawfully diverting previously denied loan applications into expedited approval channels at the SBA. When the fraudulently guaranteed loans defaulted, the defendants caused the submission of reimbursement requests to the SBA to purchase the defaulted loans from investors and lending institutions, shifting a majority of the losses on the ineligible loans to the SBA.
“Fraud against SBA loan programs directly harms taxpayers and undermines the public’s faith in in important community programs.” said Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Polite Jr. of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. “The Criminal Division is committed to prosecuting the offenders who exploit these programs and abuse the public trust.”
“These sentences hold the defendants accountable for their egregious conduct to cheat a government-guaranteed loan program — by lying on loan documentation, concealing key information, and asking the government to pay for defaulted loans,” said Inspector General Jay N. Lerner of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). “We remain committed to working with our law enforcement partners and investigating those who seek to exploit federal programs and undermine the integrity of our nation’s banks.”
“Making false statements to fraudulently gain access to SBA program funds is deplorable and it is unconscionable that anyone would steal from a program intended to help hard working Americans keep their businesses afloat,” said Acting Special Agent in Charge Gregory Nelsen of FBI Indianapolis. “The FBI and our partners will continue to work diligently to identify and pursue those engaged in such illegal activity and ensure they are no longer in a position to defraud anyone.”
“Conspiring to defraud any SBA program is a blatant attempt to selfishly rob the nation’s diverse small businesses community from supports that assist them to grow and build our strong economy,” said Special Agent in Charge Sharon Johnson of the SBA Office of Inspector General’s (OIG) Central Region. “OIG remains committed to rooting out bad actors and protecting the integrity of SBA programs every day. I want to thank the Department of Justice and our law enforcement partners for their dedication and pursuit of justice.”
In addition to their prison sentences, all four defendants were ordered to pay restitution to the SBA. Agee and Isley were each ordered to pay $2,289,681, Griffin was ordered to pay $685,022, and Matthew Smith was ordered to pay 1,651,450.
The FDIC Office of Inspector General, FBI, and SBA-OIG investigated the case.
Assistant Chief William E. Johnston and Trial Attorneys Vasanth Sridharan and Brandon Burkart of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section prosecuted the case. The Department of Housing and Urban Development Office of Inspector General also assisted in the investigation.

Woodford County Man Pleads Guilty to Wire Fraud in Connection with Fraudulently Obtained COVID Relief Loans,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/woodford-county-man-pleads-guilty-wire-fraud-connection,"December 16, 2021",2021,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Woodford County Man Pleads Guilty to Wire Fraud in Connection with Fraudulently Obtained COVID Relief Loans
LEXINGTON, Ky. – A Versailles, Ky., man, Randall “Rocky” Blankenship, Jr., 49, pleaded guilty on Thursday, before U.S. District Judge Karen C. Caldwell, to a conspiracy to commit wire fraud to obtain Paycheck Protection Program loans under false pretenses.
According to his plea agreement, in April 2020, Blankenship submitted four fraudulent applications for Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans for Blankenship RV Finance Solutions LLC, RSGG Properties LLC, RSGG Holdings LLC, and RSGG Investments LLC, all business entities he formed.  The Paycheck Protection Program was created as part of the CARES Act, a law passed in March 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Paycheck Protection Program loans were designed to provide an incentive for small businesses to keep workers on their payroll during the pandemic; these loans would be forgiven by the United States Small Business Administration, if the borrower established that loan proceeds were used for payroll, rent, or other approved business expenses.  The amount of the loan was dependent on the business’s payroll.
As part of his fraudulent PPP loan applications, Blankenship, with the assistance of a certified public accountant, created fake tax documents and payroll records indicating that his businesses had hundreds of thousands of dollars in quarterly payroll; when in fact, none of the entities had any payroll expense at all.  Blankenship submitted the applications through Kentucky Bank and Independence Bank; and as a result, he obtained fraudulent PPP loans totaling $1,323,829.  According to his plea, he used some of the funds for a RV business he owned (which had already received its own PPP loan and was ineligible for additional loans at the time), as well as personal use, including paying off casino debt and purchasing real estate.
Carlton S. Shier, IV, United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Kentucky; Jodi Cohen, Special Agent in Charge, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Louisville Field Office; Kathy Enstrom, Special Agent in Charge, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of Inspector General (FDIC-OIG); and Stephen Donnelly, Acting Special Agent in Charge, Eastern Region, Office of Inspector General for the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (FRB), jointly announced the guilty plea.  The investigation was conducted by the FBI, FDIC-OIG, and FRB.  The United States was represented by Assistant U.S. Attorney Paul McCaffrey.
Blankenship is scheduled to be sentenced on March 17, 2022. Blankenship agreed to pay restitution of $1,323,829.  He faces a maximum of twenty years in prison, a fine of not more than $250,000, and supervised release of not more than three years.  However, any sentence will be imposed by the Court, after its consideration of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and the federal sentencing statutes.

Three Middlesex County Individuals Charged with $2.1 Million in Paycheck Protection Program Fraud and Economic Injury Disaster Loan Fraud Schemes
NEWARK, N.J. – Three Middlesex County, New Jersey, residents were arrested today for their roles in fraudulently obtaining over $2.1 million in federal Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans and Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL), U.S. Attorney Philip R. Sellinger announced.
Arlen G. Encarnacion, 35, of Perth Amboy, New Jersey, is charged by complaint with 11 counts of bank fraud, three counts of wire fraud, and two counts of money laundering. Kent Encarnacion, 28, of Perth Amboy, is charged by separate complaint with one count of bank fraud and two counts of money laundering. Jacquelyn Pena, 36, of Perth Amboy, is charged by separate complaint with three counts of bank fraud and two counts of money laundering. They are all scheduled to have their initial appearances by videoconference this afternoon before U.S. Magistrate District Judge Leda Dunn Wettre.
According to documents filed in these cases and statements made in court:
Arlen G. Encarnacion submitted 11 fraudulent PPP loan applications to two different lenders on behalf of nine purported businesses and three fraudulent EIDL applications to the Small Business Association (SBA) on behalf of three purported businesses. Kent Encarnacion submitted one fraudulent PPP loan application on behalf of a purported business to one lender and Jacquelyn Pena submitted three fraudulent PPP loan applications to two different lenders on behalf of three purported businesses.
The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act is a federal law enacted on March 29, 2020, designed to provide emergency financial assistance to the millions of Americans suffering the economic effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. One source of relief provided by the CARES Act was the authorization of up to $349 billion in forgivable loans to small businesses for job retention and certain other expenses, through the PPP. In April 2020, Congress authorized over $300 billion in additional PPP funding.
The PPP allows qualifying small businesses and other organizations to receive loans with a maturity of two years and an interest rate of 1 percent. PPP loan proceeds must be used by businesses on payroll costs, interest on mortgages, rent, and utilities. The PPP allows the interest and principal on the PPP loan to be forgiven if the business spends the loan proceeds on these expense items within a designated period of time after receiving the proceeds and uses at least a certain percentage of the PPP loan proceeds on payroll expenses.
The applications the defendants each submitted allegedly contained fraudulent representations to the participating lenders and the SBA, including bogus federal tax return documentation. The defendants also each fabricated the existence of employees and the wages paid to the non-existent employees through the purported businesses. According to Social Security Administration records, there were no Forms W-3, Transmittal or Wage and Tax Statements, nor Forms W-2, Wage and Tax Statements processed for any of the defendants’ entities between 2018 and 2020.
Based on the defendants’ alleged misrepresentations, the lenders and the SBA approved the defendants’ PPP loan and EIDL applications and provided their purported businesses with approximately $2.1 million in federal COVID-19 emergency relief funds meant for distressed small businesses. Of this amount, Arlen G. Encarnacion received approximately $1.69 million, Kent Encarnacion approximately $156,000, and Jacquelyn Pena approximately $335,000. The defendants then transferred a substantial portion of the proceeds, including in connection with Jacquelyn Pena’s purchase of real estate and Arlen G. Encarnacion’s purchase of a luxury Lamborghini SUV.
Each count of bank fraud charged in the complaints carries a maximum penalty of 30 years in prison and a $1 million fine; each count of wire fraud carries a maximum penalty of 20 years; and each count of money laundering carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison. Both the wire fraud and money laundering counts carry a maximum fine of $250,000 or twice the gross gain to the defendant or gross loss to the victim, whichever is greatest.
U.S. Attorney Sellinger credited postal inspectors of U.S. Postal Inspection Service, Newark Division, under the direction of Acting Inspector in Charge Raimundo Marrero; special agents of IRS – Criminal Investigation, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Michael Montanez; special agents of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of New Jersey, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Thomas Mahoney; special agents of the Social Security Administration – Office of the Inspector General, New York Field Division, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge John Grasso; special agents of the Federal Housing Finance Agency – Office of Inspector General, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Robert Manchak; special agents of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau – Office of Inspector General, under the direction of  Acting Special Agent in Charge Stephen Donnelly; special agents of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation – Office of the Inspector General, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Patricia Tarasca in New York; and special agents of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security – Homeland Security Investigations, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Jason J. Molina in Newark, with the investigation leading to the charges. He also thanked the Middlesex County Prosecutor’s Office and the Perth Amboy Police Department for their assistance.
The government is represented by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Mark C. Orlowski and Olajide A. Araromi of the U.S. Attorney’s Office’s Government Fraud Unit in Newark.

Four Charged in $35 Million COVID-19 Relief Fraud Scheme
A federal grand jury in Houston returned a superseding indictment, which was unsealed today, charging four additional individuals for fraudulently obtaining and laundering millions of dollars in forgivable Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (SBA) under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. In total, 15 individuals across two states have now been charged in the conspiracy.
According to court documents, Hamza Abbas, 29, Khalid Abbas, 55, Abdul Fatani, 55, all of Richmond, Texas; and Syed Ali, 53, of Sugar Land, Texas, conspired with others to submit more than 80 false and fraudulent PPP loan applications by falsifying the number of employees and the average monthly payroll expenses of the applicant businesses. In total, the defendants sought over $35 million in PPP loan funds and obtained approximately $18 million in PPP loan proceeds.
The superseding indictment further alleges that the defendants laundered a portion of the fraudulent loan proceeds by writing checks from companies that received PPP loans to fake employees. Those that received checks included some of the defendants and their relatives, according to the charges. The fake paychecks were then allegedly cashed at Fascare International Inc. dba Almeda Discount Store – a check-cashing company. The superseding indictment alleges that over 1,100 fake paychecks, totaling more than $3 million in fraudulent PPP loan proceeds were cashed at Almeda.
Amir Aqeel, 53, of Houston, Texas; Siddiq Azeemuddin, 42, of Naperville, Illinois; Rifat Bajwa, 53, of Richmond, Texas; Pardeep Basra, 52, of Houston, Texas; Mayer Misak, 41, of Cypress, Texas; Mauricio Navia, 42, of Katy, Texas; and Richard Reuth, 58, of Spring, Texas, were previously indicted for their involvement in the fraudulent loan scheme. Aqeel, Bajwa, Basra, Misak, and Navia are also named defendants in the superseding indictment.
Azeemuddin and Reuth pleaded guilty for their involvement in the scheme on Oct. 8 and 9, respectively. Four other individuals – Abdul Farahshah, 70, Jesus Acosta Perez, 31, and Bijan Rajabi, 68, all of Houston, Texas; and Raheel Malik, 41, of Sugar Land, Texas – have also pleaded guilty for their involvement in the scheme. Malik pleaded guilty to a one-count information charging him with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and money laundering on Oct. 8. Farahshah, Perez, and Rajabi each pleaded guilty to a one-count information charging them with conspiracy to commit wire fraud on Nov. 30.
The defendants in the superseding indictment are all charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and wire fraud. Aqeel, Khalid Abbas, Ali, and Fatani are also charged with money laundering. Aqeel is also charged with aggravated identity theft and is alleged to have submitted PPP loan applications by stealing the identities of uninvolved parties. The defendants are scheduled for their initial court appearance tomorrow before U.S. Magistrate Judge Andrew M. Edison of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas. If convicted, the defendants face a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison per count of wire fraud, and 10 years in prison per count of money laundering. If convicted of aggravated identity theft, Aqeel faces a mandatory minimum sentence of two years in addition to the sentence imposed for the other offenses. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.

NEW ORLEANS – U.S. Attorney Duane A. Evans announced that a grand jury returned an indictment on December 10, 2021 against GLENN E. DIAZ, age 70, of Arabi; PETER J. “PETE” JENEVEIN, age 56, of Panama City, Florida; and MARK S. GRELLE, age 67, of Chalmette, for bank fraud and money laundering charges related to defrauding First NBC Bank, the New Orleans-based bank that failed in April 2017.
According to the 19-count indictment, from at least April 2016 through December 20, 2016, DIAZ, JENEVEIN, and GRELLE conspired to defraud First NBC Bank through a series of false invoices for work purportedly done at a Florida warehouse owned by DIAZ. As set forth in the indictment, DIAZ was a customer of First NBC Bank from 2006 through the bank’s closure in 2017. By late 2015, DIAZ had been overdrawing his checking account for purported business expenses, although DIAZ was depositing these overdrafts into his personal account at another bank. In April 2016, First NBC Bank officers were asking DIAZ for additional information about the use of the overdrafts. In June 2016, bank officers began requiring invoices as proof that DIAZ was spending bank funds on improving the Florida warehouse.
Thereafter, DIAZ had his associate JENEVEIN provide invoices for improvements on the Florida warehouse performed by GRELLE’s company, Grelle Underground Services LLC. Bank officers then approved the overdrafts based on these invoices. However, after DIAZ wrote the check to GRELLE’s company, GRELLE would then write a check back to DIAZ, which DIAZ would deposit into his personal account at JPMorgan Chase bank. DIAZ then used the money for expenditures unrelated to the Florida warehouse project. In total, DIAZ, JENEVEIN, and GRELLE executed a total of 17 round-trip transactions that defrauded First NBC Bank of $345,841.41.
DIAZ, JENEVEIN, and GRELLE are all charged in each of the 19 counts of the indictment. Count 1 charges the defendants with conspiracy to commit bank fraud, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Sections 1344 and 1349. The maximum penalties that may be imposed upon conviction are up to 30 years in prison, a maximum fine of the greater of $1,000,000.00 or twice the gross gain to the defendants or twice the gross loss; up to five years of supervised release; and a $100 mandatory special assessment fee.
In Count 2, DIAZ, JENEVEIN, and GRELLE are charged with conspiring to commit money laundering, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Sections 1956(a)(1)(B)(i) and 1956(h). If convicted, they face a maximum of up to 20 years in prison, a maximum fine of the greater of $500,000.00 or twice the value of the property involved in the transaction, up to three years of supervised release, and $100 mandatory special assessment fee.
In Counts 3 through 19, DIAZ, JENEVEIN, and GRELLE are charged with bank fraud, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1344. As to each count, the defendants may receive a maximum of up to 30 years in prison, a maximum fine of the greater of $1,000,000.00 or twice the gross gain to the defendants or twice the gross loss, up to five years of supervised release, and a $100 mandatory special assessment fee.
“The FBI is determined to identify, investigate, and bring to justice those who are committing financial crimes to enrich themselves at the expense of others,” said Douglas A. Williams, Jr., Special Agent in Charge, FBI New Orleans. “The FBI remains committed to investigating those who engage in white collar crimes that impact our financial institutions.”
“We will vigorously pursue any wrongdoers whose fraudulent actions impact the safety and soundness of financial institutions regulated by the Federal Reserve Board,” said Stephen Donnelly, Acting Special Agent in Charge, Eastern Region, Office of Inspector General for the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection.
U.S. Attorney Evans reiterated that an indictment is merely an accusation and that the guilt of the defendants must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.
This case is being investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation; Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Office of Inspector General; and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of Inspector General. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Matthew R. Payne, Nicholas D. Moses, J. Ryan McLaren, K. Paige O’Hale, and Rachal Cassagne are in charge of the prosecution.

Middlesex Man Sentenced to 30 Months in Prison for Paycheck Protection Program Fraud Scheme and Obtaining Funds from Stolen and Altered U.S. Treasury Check,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/middlesex-man-sentenced-30-months-prison-paycheck-protection,"December 9, 2021",2021,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Middlesex Man Sentenced to 30 Months in Prison for Paycheck Protection Program Fraud Scheme and Obtaining Funds from Stolen and Altered U.S. Treasury Check
TRENTON, N.J. – A Middlesex County, New Jersey, man was sentenced today to 30 months in prison for fraudulently receiving Payment Protection Program (PPP) funds and depositing a stolen and altered U.S. Treasury check, Acting U.S. Attorney Rachael A. Honig announced today.
Bernard Lopez, 40, previously pleaded guilty by videoconference before U.S. District Judge Peter G. Sheridan to an information charging him with one count each of bank fraud and theft of government funds. Judge Sheridan imposed the sentence today by videoconference.
According to the documents filed in this case and statements made in court:
Lopez devised a scheme to commit bank fraud through which a stolen and altered U.S. Treasury check was deposited into a corporate bank account Lopez created in the name of Pezlo Management LLC. The check was altered to be made payable to Pezlo in the amount of $211,886 and was then deposited into Pezlo’s corporate bank account. Lopez later withdrew or transferred the stolen proceeds from Pezlo’s bank account before the bank could detect the fraud.
On June 24, 2020, Lopez caused to be submitted a fraudulent PPP loan application to a lender on behalf of Company-1, a purported business that Lopez controlled. The Small Business Administration oversees the PPP, which is designed to provide forgivable loans to small businesses affected by the coronavirus pandemic. Applicants for PPP loans apply directly to banks or financial institutions participating in the program; in those applications, applicants make affirmative certifications about their average monthly payroll expenses and number of employees. Applicants also certify their intent to spend PPP proceeds on permissible business expenses, such as payroll costs, rent, utilities, and interest on mortgages. PPP loans may be entirely forgiven if the recipient spends the loan proceeds on these permissible expenses within a designated period after receiving the proceeds.
Lopez’s PPP application falsely represented that Company-1 employed 25 employees, had a monthly payroll expense of approximately $192,000, and had mortgage/lease and utilities expenses. Company-1 did not, in fact, employ any employees, nor did it incur payroll or utility expenses. Based on Lopez’s misrepresentations, the lender approved Lopez’s PPP loan application and provided Lopez’s purported business with $481,502 in federal COVID-19 emergency relief funds meant for distressed small businesses. Lopez then converted a portion of the proceeds for his own use.
In addition to the prison term, Judge Sheridan sentenced Lopez to three years of supervised release and ordered restitution of $137,000 and forfeiture of $481,502.
Acting U.S. Attorney Honig credited special agents and task force officers of the U.S. Department of the Treasury-OIG, under the direction of Assistant Inspector General for Investigations Sally D. Luttrell, and special agents and task force officers of IRS-Criminal Investigation, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Michael Montanez in Newark, with the investigation leading to today's sentencing. She also thanked special agents of the Department of Homeland Security, Homeland Security Investigations, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Jason J. Molina in Newark, and special agents of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Patricia Tarasca for assistance.
The government is represented by Assistant U.S. Attorney Perry Farhat of the Government Fraud Unit of the U.S. Attorney’s Office’s Criminal Division in Newark.

Three Directors Charged in Federal Indictment Alleging Criminal Conspiracies at Failed Chicago Bank,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/three-directors-charged-federal-indictment-alleging-criminal,"December 8, 2021",2021,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Three Directors Charged in Federal Indictment Alleging Criminal Conspiracies at Failed Chicago Bank
CHICAGO — An ongoing federal investigation into the failure of Washington Federal Bank for Savings in Chicago has resulted in criminal charges against three former members of the bank’s Board of Directors who allegedly conspired to obstruct regulators and falsify bank records.
Washington Federal was closed in December 2017 after the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency determined that the bank was insolvent and had at least $66 million in nonperforming loans.  Several former Washington Federal employees, including the bank’s Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, were previously indicted for allegedly conspiring with an Illinois attorney – ROBERT M. KOWALSKI, of Chicago – and other individuals to embezzle money from the bank.   On Tuesday, a federal grand jury in Chicago returned a 37-count superseding indictment that added four new defendants, including the three former Board members, bringing the total number of charged defendants to fourteen.
The three former Board members charged in the superseding indictment are WILLIAM M. MAHON, 55, of Chicago, JANICE M. WESTON, 63, of Orland Park, Ill., and GEORGE F. KOZDEMBA, 71, of Fort Myers, Fla.  Mahon, Weston, and Kozdemba are charged with conspiracy to falsify bank records and to deceive and obstruct the OCC.  Mahon also faces tax charges for allegedly willfully filing false income tax returns.
The fourth newly charged defendant is Robert Kowalski’s brother, real estate developer WILLIAM A. KOWALSKI, 56, of Chicago, who is charged with conspiracy to embezzle bank funds.
Arraignments in U.S. District Court in Chicago have not yet been scheduled.
The superseding indictment was announced by John R. Lausch, Jr., United States Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois; Jay N. Lerner, Inspector General of the FDIC’s Office of Inspector General; Justin Campbell, Special Agent-in-Charge of IRS Criminal Investigation in Chicago; Emmerson Buie, Jr., Special Agent-in-Charge of the Chicago Field Office of the FBI; Catherine Huber, Special Agent-in-Charge of the Central Region of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, Office of Inspector General; Michael Powell, Special Agent-in-Charge of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's Office of Inspector General in Chicago; Sally Luttrell, Assistant Inspector for Investigations of the Department of the Treasury, Office of Inspector General; and Kathryn B. Richards, Chicago Housing Authority Inspector General.  Valuable assistance was provided by the City of Chicago Inspector General’s Office and the U.S. Trustee Program.  The government is represented by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Brian Netols, Michelle Petersen, and Jeremy Daniel, and Special Assistant U.S. Attorney Jeffrey Snell.
The superseding indictment alleges that the bank’s former Vice President - JAMES R. CROTTY, of Tinley Park, Ill. – and two other employees made false entries and documents in Washington Federal’s records to support insider loans to Mahon and others.  The employees – former Corporate Secretary JANE V. IRIONDO, of Boise, Idaho, and former loan officer CATHY M. TORRES, of Chicago – allegedly altered and caused to be altered appraisals for two properties owned by Mahon that served as collateral for two mortgages at Washington Federal.  The false items on the altered appraisals include inflated appraisal values and inflated values for the listed comparable sales, the indictment states.  The superseding indictment also alleges that Mahon concealed a loan he received from Washington Federal’s president in applications for loans from Washington Federal.
The new charges allege that when the OCC was evaluating Washington Federal’s loan portfolio prior to its failure, Crotty, Mahon, Weston, and Kozdemba made and caused to be made false entries in bank records and provided them to the OCC with the intent to deceive the agency and obstruct its examination.  The defendants also falsified records to make it appear that Washington Federal was operating in compliance with banking rules and internal policies and controls, the indictment states.
In addition to the new defendants and charges, the superseding indictment renews the charges previously filed against the other defendants.  Those charges allege a conspiracy to embezzle at least $31 million in bank funds.  Crotty and other bank employees allegedly transferred bank funds to Robert Kowalski and other individuals outside the bank without all of the required documentation and often without any documentation whatsoever.  One of the individuals outside the bank – real estate developer BOGUSLAW KASPROWICZ, of Burbank, Calif. – allegedly embezzled $14.3 million, at least $1.6 million of which was used by Kasprowicz for the benefit of the bank’s former president, who has since died and is not charged in the indictment.  Kasprowicz allegedly paid credit card accounts in the name of the bank president or an entity associated with him, and also made payments to another bank for a loan on the purchase of a $450,000 Sea Ray powerboat called “Expelliarmus.”
The public is reminded that an indictment is not evidence of guilt.  The defendants are presumed innocent and entitled to a fair trial at which the government has the burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

Nonprofit CEO Pleads Guilty to Wire Fraud in Relation to Covid-19 Loan Fraud,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/nonprofit-ceo-pleads-guilty-wire-fraud-relation-covid-19-loan,"December 3, 2021",2021,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Nonprofit CEO Pleads Guilty to Wire Fraud in Relation to Covid-19 Loan Fraud
Defendant Misappropriated $305,854 in Paycheck Protection Program Loan Funds
Greenbelt , Maryland – Brandon Fitzgerald-Holley, age 32, of Suitland, Maryland, pleaded guilty today to wire fraud in relation to COVID-19 loan fraud.
The guilty plea was announced by United States Attorney for the District of Maryland Erek L. Barron; Special Agent in Charge Thomas J. Sobocinski of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Baltimore Field Office; Special Agent in Charge Shimon R. Richmond, Mid-Atlantic Region, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC-OIG); Amaleka McCall-Brathwaite, Special Agent in Charge of the Small Business Administration Office of Inspector General’s Eastern Region (SBA-OIG); Special Agent in Charge Michael McGill of the Social Security Administration Office of Inspector General, Philadelphia Field Division (SSA-OIG); and Special Agent in Charge Darrell J. Waldon of the Internal Revenue Service - Criminal Investigation, Washington, D.C. Field Office (IRS-CI).
According to his guilty plea, Fitzgerald-Holley used his non-operational nonprofit, the Coalition for Social Justice and Reform Incorporated (the Coalition), to fraudulently obtain COVID-19 relief funds. Since the Coalition’s formation in 2018, the nonprofit had no employees, income, or regular operations.
On March 31, 2020, Fitzgerald-Holley submitted an Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) application for $150,000 in funds to the Small Business administration (SBA) on behalf of the Coalition. On June 3, 2020, the SBA denied the Coalition’s application for an EIDL.  On the same day, Fitzgerald-Holley contacted the SBA to request reconsideration of the EIDL application. The SBA did not approve Fitzgerald-Holley’s request for reconsideration of his EIDL or provide Fitzgerald-Holley with any EIDL funding.
Further, on June 13, 2020, shortly after Fitzgerald-Holley’s fraudulent EIDL application was denied, Fitzgerald-Holley submitted an application to Institution 1 for a for a $305,854 Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan. Institution 1 is an online financial technology company that specializes in small business lending and participating as a non-bank PPP lender.
On the PPP loan application, Fitzgerald-Holley falsely listed that the Coalition employed 25 employees, had an average monthly payroll cost of $122,342. In reality, the Coalition had no employees or payroll expenses. Fitzgerald-Holley also created and submitted fraudulent documents including a fraudulent IRS Form W-3, which falsely stated that the Coalition had 25 employees with total wages of $1,385,000.
On June 13, 2020, the Coalition’s PPP loan application was approved. Fitzgerald-Holley signed the note on the loan as the CEO of the Coalition. Institution 1 subsequently deposited $305,854 in PPP loan funds into Fitzgerald-Holley’s personal account on June 16, 2020.
As stated in his plea agreement, upon receiving the fraudulently obtained PPP proceeds, Fitzgerald-Holley used the funds to purchase personal items including clothing, a pool table, televisions, electronic equipment, a 2020 Dodge Charger Scat, and various accessories for the vehicle. He also used the funds to fund a vacation rental. In total, Fitzgerald-Holley misappropriated $305,854 in PPP loan funds.
Fitzgerald-Holley faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in federal prison for wire fraud. United States District Judge George J. Hazel has scheduled sentencing for March 7, 2021 at 10 a.m.
United States Attorney Erek L. Barron commended the FBI, FDIC-OIG, SBA-OIG, SSA-OIG, and the IRS-CI for their work in the investigation. Mr. Barron thanked Assistant U.S. Attorney Caitlin R. Cottingham andTrial Attorney John Liolos of the Department of Justice Criminal Division’s Fraud Section, who are prosecuting the case.

Three South Florida Men Sentenced for Conspiring to Launder Fraudulently Obtained Covid-19 Relief Money and Proceeds from Business Email Compromise Schemes,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/three-south-florida-men-sentenced-conspiring-launder,"December 2, 2021",2021,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Three South Florida Men Sentenced for Conspiring to Launder Fraudulently Obtained Covid-19 Relief Money and Proceeds from Business Email Compromise Schemes
Miami, Florida – A South Florida federal district judge sentenced three Broward County residents to prison terms this week for conspiring with each other to launder proceeds obtained from business email compromise schemes and fraudulently obtained Covid-19 relief loans.
Jimpcy One, 35, was sentenced to 36 months’ imprisonment.  Frantz Guillaume, Jr. a/k/a Sandro Saintfloeur, 44, was sentenced to 46 months in prison.  Gousman Lemy, 43, was sentenced to 51 months in prison.  In addition, they were each ordered to pay approximately $1.8 million in restitution.
A business email compromise scheme is a type of computer intrusion that occurs when an employee of a company is fooled into interacting with an email message that appears to be, but is not, legitimate.  The bogus email usually contains either an attachment or a link to a malicious website or program.  When an unwitting user clicks on either the link or the attachment, it releases some form of malware (i.e., a virus, spyware, or other program application) that subsequently infects the employee’s email and/or computer.  The malware may affect an employee’s individual account or spread throughout the computer network.  The malware, once executed, can harvest information including but not limited to credentials and passwords, thereby giving the intruder access to sensitive company information.
According to court documents, in July of 2017, Lemy and Guillaume laundered a little over $425,000 obtained from a business email compromise of a Texas based university.  Then, in 2019, One joined Lemy, and Guillaume in laundering over $900,000 obtained from a business email compromise of another U.S. based victim company.  In each business email compromise scheme, co-conspirators sent false and fraudulent emails from a hacked account which tricked the victims into wiring money into accounts controlled by the defendants and their co-conspirators.  One, Gousman, and Lemy then sought to conceal the origin of this fraudulently obtained money by transferring it among the bank accounts of various shell companies that One, Gousman, and Lemy controlled.
When the coronavirus pandemic hit the United States in 2020, One, Gousman, and Lemy allegedly initiated a new fraud scheme using existing shell companies from the email compromise scheme, as well as newly created and reactivated shell companies.  Defendants allegedly submitted false and fraudulent loan applications under two U.S. government relief programs authorized by the CARES Act to help small businesses and their employees survive the Covid-19 economic crisis: the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan Program (“EIDL”).  In June and July 2020, through false submissions in the names of their shell companies, One, Gousman, and Lemy fraudulently applied for and received close to $2 million in PPP and EIDL funds, which was laundered amongst the co-conspirators.
Juan Antonio Gonzalez, United States Attorney for the Southern District of Florida; George L. Piro, Special Agent in Charge, FBI Miami; Kyle A. Myles, Special Agent in Charge, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of Inspector General (FDIC-OIG), Atlanta Region; and Amaleka McCall-Brathwaite, Special Agent in Charge of U.S. Small Business Administration, Office of Inspector General (SBA-OIG), Eastern Regional Office announced the sentences imposed by U.S. District Judge Rodolfo A. Ruiz, who sits in Ft. Lauderdale.
FBI Miami, FDIC-OIG, and SBA-OIG handled the investigation, with assistance from the United States Secret Service Miami Field Office and the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration Cybercrimes Division.  Assistant U.S. Attorney Brooke Watson is prosecuting the case.  Assistant U.S. Attorney Nicole Grosnoff is handling asset forfeiture.

Former Chief Lending Officer of New Jersey Bank Sentenced to 18 Months in Prison for Making False Statements to United States to Secure Federal Guarantees on Loans,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/former-chief-lending-officer-new-jersey-bank-sentenced-18-months,"December 1, 2021",2021,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Former Chief Lending Officer of New Jersey Bank Sentenced to 18 Months in Prison for Making False Statements to United States to Secure Federal Guarantees on Loans
TRENTON, N.J. – A Pennsylvania man was sentenced today to 18 months in prison for securing a federal guarantee on certain loans by making false statements to the Small Business Administration (SBA) about the creditworthiness of those loans while serving as the chief lending officer of a New Jersey bank, Acting U.S. Attorney Rachael A. Honig announced.
James Bortolotti, 53, previously pleaded guilty before U.S. District Judge Michael Shipp in Trenton federal court to an information charging him with one count of knowingly making false statements for the purpose of influencing the action of the SBA. Judge Shipp imposed the sentence by videoconference today.
According to documents filed in this case and statements made in court:
While serving as the chief lending officer of a New Jersey bank (Bank-1), Bortolotti became aware of a Small Business Administration lending program to incentivize lenders, including banks, to loan money to small businesses by providing a 75 percent SBA-backed guarantee on loans. When a lender applies an SBA guarantee on a loan, the lender must disclose information related to the creditworthiness of the small business. Bank-1 hired a consulting firm to help the bank apply for SBA-backed guarantees.
On Feb. 29, 2012, a consultant from the consulting firm submitted an application to the SBA for a guarantee of approximately $3.75 million on loans totaling approximately $5 million made to a small business located in Robbinsville, New Jersey. The application contained false information related to the creditworthiness of the business. Bortolotti knew the application contained false information, but he nevertheless reviewed and signed the application on behalf of the bank.
In addition to the prison term, Judge Shipp sentenced Bortolotti to three years of supervised release and ordered him to pay restitution of $3.17 million to the SBA.
Acting U.S. Attorney Honig credited special agents of the SBA-Office of the Inspector General (SBA-OIG), Eastern Region, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Amaleka McCall-Brathwaite; the FDIC-Office of the Inspector General (FDIC-OIG), under the direction of Inspector General Jay N. Lerner; special agents of the FBI, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge George M. Crouch Jr. in Newark, and special agents of the Federal Housing Finance Agency – Office of Inspector General (FHFA-OIG), under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Robert Manchak, with the investigation leading to today’s sentencing.

On June 3, 2020, a grand jury returned a 24-count Indictment against McCord.  The charges included bank fraud, money laundering, and making a false statement to a financial institution.  McCord was the Chairman and founder of First Mortgage Company, LLC (""FMC""), an Oklahoma City-based mortgage lending and loan servicing company.  In May 2021, McCord pleaded guilty to five counts of that Indictment.  McCord admitted to defrauding Spirit Bank (""Spirit"") and Citizens State Bank (""Citizens"")—two state-chartered financial institutions—as well as their respective residential mortgage subsidiaries, American Southwest Mortgage Corporation (""Mortgage Corp."") and American Southwest Mortgage Funding Corporation (""Funding Corp."").  An independent audit discovered that McCord had sold more than $14,100,000.00 in Spirit/Mortgage Corp. and Citizens/Funding Corp. loans ""out of trust"" by failing to repay Spirit/Mortgage Corp. when certain Spirit/Mortgage Corp.-initiated loans were refinanced or otherwise paid off.  At the time of this discovery, FMC carried outstanding balances of about $200,000,000.00 and $140,000,000.00 on the Spirit/Mortgage Corp. and Citizens/Funding Corp. lines of credit, respectively.
Upon learning of McCord’s conduct, Spirit/Mortgage Corp. and Citizens/Funding Corp. terminated future warehouse lending to FMC, and instituted new notification requirements that required McCord to assign FMC-funded mortgages to Spirit/Mortgage Corp. and Citizens/Funding Corp., to ensure the title companies handling those mortgages sent payoffs directly to the banks.  McCord admitted at his change of plea hearing that he filed the assignments as required, but then caused the mortgages to be released on two properties—in Leland and Denver, North Carolina—after collecting the mortgage payoffs.
Spirit/Mortgage Corp. and Citizens/Funding Corp.’s refusal to fund new FMC mortgages prompted McCord to seek out a new warehouse lender.  In early 2017, McCord began negotiating with CapLOC, LLC, a North Carolina-based mortgage lending business, and offered to sell FMC’s mortgage lending business in exchange for quick funding from CapLOC.  McCord admitted that he made a materially false statement and representation to CapLOC in the course of those negotiations, in order to influence CapLOC’s actions.
Finally, in 2017, FMC serviced approximately 12,000 loans worth a total of approximately $1,800,000,000.00 for the Federal National Mortgage Association (“Fannie Mae”).  McCord admitted at his plea hearing that he defrauded Fannie Mae by diverting escrow monies intended to pay homeowners’ taxes and insurance premiums to cover FMC’s operating expenses.  McCord also admitted that he then laundered the proceeds by causing a wire transfer from FMC’s operating account to a custom home builder, as payment towards construction of McCord’s vacation home in Colorado.
At today’s sentencing hearing, the Honorable Robin J. Cauthron found that McCord caused a total loss of more than $95,000,000.00 to local banks, other financial institutions, and borrower homeowners.  Judge Cauthron heard statements from representatives of three of those victims, as well as argument from both parties, before rendering the 104-month sentence.  The Court ordered McCord to self-surrender to the Federal Bureau of Prisons on January 6, 2022 to commence his term of imprisonment.  The Court also ordered McCord to serve three years of supervised release following his term of incarceration.
This case was the result of investigations by the Federal Housing Finance Agency – Office of the Inspector General, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation – Office of Inspector General, and the FBI Oklahoma City Field Office.  Assistant U.S. Attorney Julia E. Barry prosecuted the case.

Fox Point Man Indicted For Defrauding Investors of Over $5.5 Million
Acting United States Attorney Richard G. Frohling of the Eastern District of Wisconsin announced that on November 16, 2021, a federal grand jury indicted David O. Braeger (age: 54), of Fox Point, Wisconsin, for three counts of Wire Fraud, three counts of Bank Fraud, one count of Mail Fraud, and and two counts of Engaging in Unlawful Monetary Transactions, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1341, 1343, 1344, and 1957.
If convicted, Braeger faces a maximum sentence of thirty years in prison, up to five years of supervised release, and up to a $1,000,000 fine for each of the Bank Fraud counts.  He faces a maximum sentence of twenty years in prison, up to five years of supervised release, and up to a $250,000 fine for each of the Wire Fraud counts and the Mail Fraud count.  He also faces a maximum of ten years in prison, up to three years of supervised release, and up to a $250,000 fine for each of the Engaging in Unlawful Monetary Transaction counts.
According to the indictment, beginning on or about September 2016 and August 2017, Braeger engaged in two separate investment schemes in which he defrauded victims into investing in entities based on false representations and promises. The indictment alleges that instead of using the investor funds as promised, Braeger used a significant portion of the victims’ money to make Ponzi-like payments to prior investors and to fund his own lifestyle. The indictment further alleges that between 2016 and 2018, Braeger fraudulently obtained over $5.5 million from his victims.
In 2020, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) barred Braeger from associating with any member in any capacity based on findings that Braeger made misrepresentations and omissions to customers concerning investments he sold and findings that he converted and misused customer funds.
The Wisconsin Department of Financial Institutions and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation-Office of the Inspector General investigated the case, which Assistant United States Attorney Julie F. Stewart will prosecute.
An indictment is only a charge and not evidence of guilt. The defendant is presumed innocent and is entitled to a fair trial at which the government must prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

Seattle Doctor Found Guilty of Fraudulently Obtaining Millions of Dollars from COVID-19 Relief Programs
A federal jury convicted a Seattle doctor yesterday of fraudulently seeking over $3.5 million in Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) and Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) COVID-19 relief funds.
According to court documents and evidence presented at trial, Eric R. Shibley, 41, of Seattle, submitted several fraudulent PPP and EIDL loan applications to federally insured financial institutions, other Small Business Administration (SBA)-approved lenders, and the SBA, in the names of businesses with no actual operations or by otherwise misrepresenting the business’s eligibility. In the applications, Shibley falsified the number of employees and payroll expenses and concealed his own criminal history. To support the fraudulent applications, Shibley submitted fake tax documents and the names of purported employees who did not, in fact, work for the businesses for which Shibley claimed they worked. Shibley received over $2.8 million in COVID-19 relief funds as a result of the fraud.
Shibley was convicted of multiple counts of wire fraud, multiple counts of bank fraud, and money laundering. He is scheduled to be sentenced on Feb. 22, 2022, and faces 20 years for each count of wire fraud, 30 years for each count of bank fraud, and 10 years for money laundering. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.

Four Executives Plead Guilty to Fraud Scheme that Caused Over $4.5 Million in Losses to the Small Business Administration
Three former executives of Valley Bank, a defunct financial institution based in Moline, Illinois, and the President of Vital Financial Services (Vital Financial), a lending service provider, have pleaded guilty to scheming to defraud the Small Business Administration (SBA) in connection with its programs to guarantee loans made to small businesses.
According to court document, the defendants — Michael Slater, 65, of Clive, Iowa, former President and Founder of Vital Financial; Larry Henson, 70, of Davenport, Iowa, former President and Chairman of Valley Bank; Andrew Erpelding, 43, also of Davenport, Iowa, former Vice President and Regional Manager of Valley Bank; and Susan McLaughlin, 68, of Bettendorf, Iowa, former Vice President for Credit Administration of Valley Bank — conspired to and did fraudulently obtain loan guarantees from the SBA on behalf of Valley Bank borrowers, knowing that the loans did not meet SBA’s guidelines and requirements for the guarantees. They did so by, among other things, altering loan payment histories, renaming businesses, and hiding the fact that borrowers had previously defaulted on loans. When the fraudulently guaranteed loans defaulted, the defendants caused the submission of reimbursement requests to the SBA to purchase the defaulted loans from investors and lending institutions, thereby shifting the majority of losses on the ineligible loans to the SBA. In all, the defendants attempted to obtain guarantees on over $14 million in loans, were successful in obtaining guarantees on over $9 million in loans, and caused the SBA losses of over $4.5 million.
All four defendants pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud affecting a financial institution. McLaughlin pleaded guilty on Sept. 20; Erpelding on Sept. 21; Henson on Nov. 9; and Slater on Nov. 18. The defendants each face a maximum penalty of 30 years in prison. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.

Second DC Solar Defendant Sentenced to 3 Years in Prison for Billion Dollar Ponzi Scheme
SACRAMENTO, Calif. — Joseph W. Bayliss, 46, of Martinez, was sentenced today to three years in prison and ordered to pay $481.3 million in restitution for participating in a billion-dollar Ponzi scheme involving DC Solar, Acting U.S. Attorney Phillip A. Talbert announced.
According to court documents, Bayliss was an electrician that DC Solar hired to pose as a licensed engineer who inspected newly constructed mobile solar generator units (MSG) that were mounted on trailers and were promoted as able to provide emergency power to cellphone towers and lighting at sporting events. The MSGs were sold to investors who were given generous federal tax credits. But in fact, DC Solar had become a fraud scheme that took new investor money to pay older investors. As DC Solar lost vast sums of money with this fraudulent model, the owner of DC Solar, Jeff Carpoff, and other conspirators stopped building the MSGs altogether, selling thousands of MSGs that did not even exist to investors.
According to court documents, Bayliss played a key role in the fraud scheme orchestrated by Carpoff and others. To cover up the fact that no new MSGs were being built, Carpoff provided false reports that newly constructed MSGs had been inspected and tested. In reality, at least half of the approximately 17,000 mobile solar generators claimed to have been manufactured by DC Solar did not exist. From 2016 to 2018, Bayliss personally signed thousands of reports stating that new units had been inspected and tested. He knew the reports were false and he knew they would be used to induce millions upon millions of investor payments. In turn, Carpoff paid Bayliss approximately $1 million. In addition to the reports, Bayliss helped to deceive investors by removing and replacing vehicle identification number (VIN) stickers that were affixed to the MSGs. Finally, after the 2018 search warrants executed at DC Solar, at Carpoff’s direction, Bayliss traveled to a DC Solar warehouse in Nevada and scraped off approximately 200 replacement VIN stickers and destroyed at least 1,000 VIN stickers stored in boxes in the warehouse.
On Nov. 9, 2021, Jeff Carpoff was sentenced to 30 years in prison and ordered to pay $790.6 million in restitution for conspiracy to commit wire fraud and money laundering. His wife, Paulette Carpoff, 47, has pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit an offense against the United States and money laundering, and is scheduled to be sentenced on March 22, 2022.
Other defendants have pleaded guilty to criminal offenses related to the fraud scheme and are scheduled for sentencing: Ronald J. Roach, 54, of Walnut Creek, is scheduled for sentencing on Feb. 15, 2022. Robert A. Karmann, 54, of Clayton; Ryan Guidry, 44, of Pleasant Hill; and Alan Hansen, 50, of Vacaville, are scheduled to be sentenced on Dec. 14, 2021.
This case is the product of an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, IRS Criminal Investigation, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Christopher S. Hales and Kevin C. Khasigian are prosecuting the case.
Paulette Carpoff, Hansen, Karmann, and Guidry face a maximum statutory penalty of 15 years in prison. Roach faces a maximum statutory penalty of 10 years prison. The actual sentences, however, will be determined at the discretion of the court after consideration of any applicable statutory factors and the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, which take into account a number of variables.

International Wholesale Currency Dealer Sentenced for Criminal Operations; Forfeits $1.1 Million
Assistant U. S. Attorneys Michael A. Deshong, Daniel C. Silva, and Carl Brooker (619) 546-9290
NEWS RELEASE SUMMARY—November 16, 2021
SAN DIEGO — GPOMCT Grupo Empresarial S.A. de C.V., an international, Mexico-based wholesale currency dealer and currency exchange business, was sentenced in federal court yesterday to three years’ probation and ordered to forfeit $1.1 million for operating an unlicensed money transmitting business.
According to the government’s sentencing memorandum, GPOMCT used the U.S. financial system to process large amounts of currency that were at high risk for including criminal proceeds without registering as a financial institution in the United States or complying with U.S. anti-money laundering regulations or reporting requirements in order to gain a competitive advantage over its competitors.
Mexico’s anti-money laundering restrictions limit the amount of U.S. dollar deposits in Mexico, creating a need for individuals and businesses in Mexico with large amounts of U.S. currency—whether acquired legitimately or otherwise—to convert their U.S. dollars into Mexican pesos. This is a need that GPOMCT attempted to meet, the sentencing memo said.
Special Agents from Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) led the investigation into hundreds of transactions that involved GPOMCT importing large volumes of U.S. dollars into the United States between 2019 and 2021. Agents from Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and San Diego County Sheriff's Department assisted HSI in the investigation.
According to the sentencing memorandum, GPOMCT gained an unfair competitive advantage by accepting large amounts of U.S. dollars from its customers in Mexico in exchange for pesos, then importing its U.S. dollars into the United States. Through its subsidiaries, GPOMCT controls more than 40 locations in Mexico that handle an average of over $1 million in U.S. currency daily. Between September 2019 and September 2020, GPOMCT imported approximately 195 shipments of currency—each worth between $90,000 and $100,000 in U.S. dollars. GPOMCT further employed the services of an armored car company to collect currency for delivery to a third-party intermediary in Miami, Florida—all part of its money transmitting services to Mexican and U.S. customers seeking to convert U.S. dollars to pesos.
These services as a wholesale currency dealer meant GPOMCT operated as an unlicensed money transmitting business in the United States. By failing to register as a money transmitting business, GPOMCT did not file currency transaction reports with the Department of the Treasury, as required by the Bank Secrecy Act, nor did it subject itself to inspection by the Department of Treasury for compliance with these financial laws and regulations.
Acting U.S. Attorney Randy S. Grossman said, “Violating financial laws and regulations not only impairs the fight against international money laundering, tax evasion, and other crimes—these violations can be crimes themselves. This office expects the highest level of compliance from financial institutions in the Southern District of California.” Grossman praised the prosecution team at the U.S. Attorney’s Office and the agents from Homeland Security Investigations, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, U.S. Customs and Border Protection and San Diego County Sheriff’s Department for their excellent work on this case.
“When money services businesses fail to comply with federal statutes and regulations, they create an unacceptable risk for illicit funds to be laundered through our financial infrastructure,” said Chad Plantz, Acting Special Agent in Charge for Homeland Security Investigations in San Diego. “HSI is committed to investigating these violations to uphold the integrity of the U.S. financial system and protect our communities, as well as sending a resounding message to all currency exchange businesses, money services businesses, and financial institutions to comply and embrace robust anti-money laundering practices and regulations.”
“Financial crimes, such as those in this case, threaten the integrity of the U.S. financial system and allow money laundering, tax evasion, and other illicit transactions to spread across international borders, undermining the public’s faith in financial institutions. We appreciate the cooperation of our law enforcement partners in investigating this and other financial crimes,” said Special Agent in Charge Jeffrey D. Pittano of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC OIG).

DC Solar Owner Sentenced to 30 Years in Prison for Billion Dollar Ponzi Scheme
Biggest Criminal Fraud Scheme in the History of the Eastern District of California
SACRAMENTO, Calif. — An owner of DC Solar, a Benicia-based company, was sentenced today for a billion-dollar Ponzi scheme— the biggest criminal fraud scheme in the history of the Eastern District of California, Acting U.S. Attorney Phillip A. Talbert announced.
U.S. District Judge John A. Mendez sentenced Jeff Carpoff, 50, of Martinez, to 30 years in prison. On Jan. 24, 2020, Carpoff pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud and money laundering. His wife, Paulette Carpoff, 47, also pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit an offense against the United States and money laundering. The government’s investigation has resulted in approximately $120 million in assets forfeited that the government intends to seek authorization to use towards restitution to victims of the fraud.
According to court documents, between 2011 and 2018, DC Solar manufactured mobile solar generator units (MSG), which were solar generators that were mounted on trailers and were promoted as able to provide emergency power to cellphone towers and lighting at sporting events. A significant incentive for investors were generous federal tax credits due to the solar nature of the MSGs.
The conspirators carried out an accounting and lease revenue fraud using Ponzi-like circular payments. Carpoff and others lied to investors about the market demand for DC Solar’s MSGs and its revenue from leasing to third parties, then covered up these lies with techniques including false financial statements and fake lease contracts. Their fraud concealed a circular payment structure where Carpoff and others were simply using new investor money to pay older investors the supposed lease revenue that investors were expecting. As DC Solar lost vast sums of money with this fraudulent model, Carpoff and other conspirators stopped building the MSGs altogether, selling thousands of MSGs that did not even exist to investors. To carry out this part of the fraud, Carpoff and others made it appear that MSGs existed in locations that they did not, swapped vehicle identification number (VIN) stickers on MSGs that had been built earlier, and attempted to deceive certain investors during equipment inspections. In reality, at least half of the approximately 17,000 mobile solar generators claimed to have been manufactured by DC Solar did not exist.
“Jeff Carpoff orchestrated the largest criminal fraud scheme in the history of the Eastern District of California,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Talbert. “He claimed to be an innovator in alternative energy, but he was really just stealing money from investors and costing the American taxpayer hundreds of millions in tax credits. Today’s substantial sentence reflects the seriousness of the offense and provides just punishment. The U.S. Attorney’s Office is committed to protecting the public and promoting respect for the law.”
“Carpoff’s egregious scheme fueled his rapacious desire for luxury and prominence with showy, public expenditures including the purchase of a sports team, high-end collector’s vehicles, international real estate and a NASCAR team,” said Special Agent in Charge Sean Ragan of the FBI Sacramento Field Office. “I thank the team of determined FBI special agents, forensic accountants and professional staff who worked tirelessly with IRS Criminal Investigation and FDIC Office of Inspector General to thoroughly investigate this complex case. Our office is committed to identifying and investigating financial fraud and encourage the public to report suspected fraud to tips.fbi.gov .”
“Mr. Carpoff lived a luxurious life as a successful businessman,” said Special Agent in Charge Mark H. Pearson. “In reality, he manipulated the system to his advantage by lying to investors, promising significant federal tax credits, and laundering his ill-gotten gains. IRS Criminal Investigation will continue to work with our federal partners to ensure that anyone involved in these types of schemes, no matter how big or small, will be held accountable for their crimes.”
“Today’s sentencing recognizes the importance of holding Mr. Carpoff accountable for his role in conspiring with others to defraud investors of approximately $1 billion through the creation of a fraudulent business venture, and using the proceeds for his and his wife’s own personal gain,” said Special Agent in Charge Jeffrey D. Pittano of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC OIG). “The FDIC OIG is committed to working with our law enforcement partners in bringing to justice those who undermine the integrity of the financial system.”
The forfeiture included seizing and auctioning 148 of the Carpoffs’ luxury and collector vehicles, including the 1978 Firebird previously owned by actor Burt Reynolds. This historical auction resulted in recouping approximately $8.233 million. In addition to their collection of luxury and collector vehicles, Jeff and Paulette Carpoff used money from the scheme to pay for a minor-league professional baseball team and a NASCAR racecar sponsorship; to purchase luxury real estate in California, Nevada, the Caribbean, Mexico, and elsewhere; a subscription private jet service; a suite at a professional football stadium; and jewelry.
In addition to the Carpoffs, five other defendants have been charged with criminal offenses related to the fraud scheme: Joseph W. Bayliss, 46, of Martinez, and Ronald J. Roach, 54, of Walnut Creek, each pleaded guilty to related charges on Oct. 22, 2019. Bayliss is scheduled for sentencing on Nov. 16, 2021, and Roach is scheduled for sentencing on Feb. 15, 2022. Robert A. Karmann, 54, of Clayton, pleaded guilty to related charges on Dec. 17, 2019; and Ryan Guidry, 44, of Pleasant Hill, pleaded guilty to related charges on Jan. 14, 2020. Alan Hansen, 50, of Vacaville, a former employee of a telecom company with which DC Solar purported to do business, pleaded guilty on July 28, 2020, to participating in the fraud scheme and accepting a $1 million bribe to sign a false contract. Karmann, Guidry, and Hansen are scheduled to be sentenced on Dec. 14, 2021. Paulette Carpoff is scheduled to be sentenced on Nov. 16, 2021.
This case is the product of an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, IRS‑Criminal Investigation, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Christopher S. Hales and Kevin C. Khasigian are prosecuting the case.
Paulette Carpoff, Hansen, Karmann, and Guidry face a maximum statutory penalty of 15 years in prison. Roach and Bayliss face maximum statutory penalties of 10 years and five years in prison, respectively. The actual sentences, however, will be determined at the discretion of the court after consideration of any applicable statutory factors and the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, which take into account a number of variables.

Two Men Plead Guilty in Multimillion-Dollar COVID-19 Relief Scheme
Two individuals pleaded guilty today in the Southern District of Texas for their participation in a scheme to fraudulently obtain and launder millions of dollars in forgivable Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (SBA) under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act.
According to court documents, Siddiq Azeemuddin, 42, of Naperville, Illinois, and Raheel Malik, 41, of Sugar Land, Texas, engaged in a scheme to defraud the SBA and certain SBA-approved PPP lenders by submitting false and fraudulent PPP loan applications. Azeemuddin and Malik also conspired to and did launder over $3 million in PPP loan funds through Azeemuddin’s business, Fascare International Inc., dba Almeda Discount Store (Almeda). As part of the scheme, Azeemuddin instructed Malik to fill out blank checks from companies that received PPP loans by putting the names of fake employees in the payee line. At Azeemuddin’s direction, Malik then cashed the checks at a financial institution and then transported the cash to other members of the conspiracy. In exchange for laundering the funds, Azeemuddin received 1% to 2% of each check cashed.
Azeemuddin pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and one count of money laundering. He is scheduled to be sentenced on March 7, 2022, and faces a maximum total penalty of 40 years in prison. Malik pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and money laundering. He is scheduled to be sentenced on March 7, 2022, and faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.

Manhattan Man Pleads Guilty To $6.9 Million Scheme To Defraud Loan Program Intended To Help Small Businesses During COVID-19 Pandemic
Damian Williams, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, announced today that MARCUS FRAZIER pled guilty to carrying out a fraudulent scheme to obtain $6.9 million in government-guaranteed loans designed to provide relief to small businesses during the novel coronavirus/COVID-19 pandemic.  FRAZIER pled guilty before United States District Judge Alison Nathan, to whom his case is assigned.
U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said: “Marcus Frazier sought millions of dollars in unsecured SBA-guaranteed loans for which his businesses did not qualify.  He lied about the number of people employed by his businesses, the salaries they were paid, even that these employees existed.  Further, Frazier used the loan proceeds he obtained to fund his lavish lifestyle, not to pay permissible expenses.  Now Marcus Frazier awaits sentencing for his admitted crimes.”
According to the allegations in the Complaint, court filings, and statements made during plea proceedings:
The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act is a federal law enacted on March 29, 2020, designed to provide emergency financial assistance to the millions of Americans who are suffering the economic effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.  One source of relief provided by the CARES Act was the authorization of up to $349 billion in forgivable loans to small businesses for job retention and certain other business expenses through the Paycheck Protection Program (the “PPP”).  The PPP allows qualifying small businesses and other organizations to receive unsecured loans guaranteed by the U.S. Small Business Administration (the “SBA”).  PPP loan proceeds must be used by businesses for payroll costs, mortgage interest, rent, and/or utilities, among other specified expenses.  Pursuant to the CARES Act, the amount of PPP funds a business is eligible to receive is determined by the number of employees employed by the business and its average payroll costs.  Businesses applying for a PPP loan must provide documentation to confirm that they have in the past paid employees the compensation represented in the loan application.
Between in or about May 2020 and in or about April 2021, FRAZIER submitted to the SBA at least seven applications for PPP loans for various businesses that he controlled (collectively, the “Frazier Companies”).  These applications relied upon fraudulent statements regarding the number of employees of each business and the amount of payroll involved in each business, and were submitted, in many cases, alongside fake bank statements, designed to support FRAZIER’s false statements.  These fake bank statements included, among other things, fraudulent account statements for a checking account that showed balances far greater than the account actually held, and that depicted payroll withdrawals that never occurred.  FRAZIER also submitted lists of employees on the purported payrolls of the Frazier Companies, which included names and Social Security numbers which do not match the records of the Social Security Administration, suggesting that FRAZIER fabricated the employee records.  On at least one occasion, FRAZIER also provided documents purporting to show that one of the Frazier Companies had been in existence for approximately 10 years.  In fact, the corporate entity had not been registered until in or about July 2020, months after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.
FRAZIER sought a total of more than approximately $6.9 million in PPP loans and was awarded at least approximately $2.17 million.  A substantial portion of the funds awarded was spent not on payroll for the Frazier Companies but, rather, on FRAZIER’s personal expenses.  During the period between on or about June 18, 2020, shortly after his first PPP loan was funded, and on or about April 7, 2021, FRAZIER utilized PPP funds to spend approximately $124,982 on hotels, including more than approximately $88,791 at a luxury hotel located in Miami, Florida.  During the same period, FRAZIER spent approximately $63,000 on restaurants and food service, approximately $17,000 on transportation using the ride-hailing app Uber, approximately $16,519 on airline travel, and approximately $11,000 on clothing.  During this same period, FRAZIER collected approximately $21,000 in unemployment benefits.
In addition, between in or about January 2018 and in or about November 2019, FRAZIER engaged in a scheme to obtain personal loans from financial institutions and to evade the payment of credit card debt by making false representations, and sending fake documents, to lenders and banks.
*                *                *
FRAZIER, 48, of New York, New York York, pled guilty to two counts of wire fraud affecting a financial institution, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1343, each of which carries a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison.  The maximum potential sentences in this case are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendant will be determined by the judge.
FRAZIER is scheduled to be sentenced by Judge Nathan on March 1, 2022, at 3:00 p.m.
Mr. Williams praised the outstanding investigative work of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the SBA Office of the Inspector General, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of the Inspector General.
The case is being prosecuted by the Office’s Complex Frauds and Cybercrime Unit.  Assistant U.S. Attorney Katherine Reilly is in charge of the prosecution.

Tulsa Man Pleads Guilty to Defrauding Investor and Banks of Millions of Dollars,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/tulsa-man-pleads-guilty-defrauding-investor-and-banks-millions,"October 20, 2021",2021,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Tulsa Man Pleads Guilty to Defrauding Investor and Banks of Millions of Dollars
A con artist who defrauded a man out of $4.5 million and defrauded banks out of $3.9 million pleaded guilty Tuesday in U.S. District Court, announced Acting U.S. Attorney Clint Johnson.
William Brian Mulder, 63, of Tulsa, pleaded guilty to causing the interstate transmission of moneys taken by fraud and money laundering.
“William Mulder was driven by greed and a relentless spirit of deception. For nearly twenty years, this fraudster repeatedly lied to and cheated friends and banks out of millions of dollars,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Clint Johnson. “I commend the team of federal prosecutors and agents who brought Mulder to justice for his criminal deceit.”
Mulder was set to go to trial this week but instead pleaded guilty. Mulder admitted that beginning in 2000 and continuing through 2017, he received numerous checks totaling approximately $4.5 million from the victim, who was a local businessman and friend to Mulder. Mulder advised the victim to create a trust for his special needs son and for which Mulder would be the trustee and have complete discretion and control. Mulder told the victim that he would prudently invest the funds on the son’s behalf. Instead, Mulder used the funds for his own personal expenses and enrichment.
Mulder admitted that in December 2015, he fraudulently received a check from the victim in the amount of $142,500 and deposited funds from the check in the amount of $83,378.54 into his personal account, which he later used on a personal investment in generators in Missouri.
Further, Mulder admitted that he lied about his assets and submitted fabricated documents to obtain loans from Oklahoma banks in order to support a lifestyle he couldn’t afford on his own.
According to the indictment, Mulder, as part of his scheme, misrepresented himself as worth millions to friends. Mulder told several individuals that a wealthy Missouri widow had left him over $100 million in a blind trust in appreciation for his services as an insurance salesman for the widow. In another story, he said he was the beneficiary of a different blind trust worth hundreds of millions of dollars from his father. The government alleged that Mulder convinced his friends that if they pooled their investments with his fortune, they could grow their money faster. To cover his tracks, Mulder created a web of convoluted rules and restrictions to keep the victims from seeing the progress of their investments. The government alleged that, in reality, there were no investments. Mulder deposited checks into his personal bank accounts and used the funds to pay off credit card debts and to run a coffee shop chain. He also allegedly moved money between more than 60 bank accounts in order to make it difficult for the investors and law enforcement to follow the trail of money.
As part of the plea deal, Mulder agreed to pay $3.9 million in restitution to two of the banks and $4.5 million in restitution to his former friend and investor. Mulder also faces a sentence of 70 to 90 months in federal prison if the plea agreement is accepted by Chief U.S. District Judge John F. Heil III. Judge Heil will determine the sentence at a hearing on April 28, 2022.
The FBI, IRS-Criminal Investigation, U.S. Department of Treasury-Office of Inspector General; and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)-Office of Inspector General conducted the investigation. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Kevin C. Leitch, Vani Singhal, and Thomas E. Duncombe are prosecuting the case.

Liberian National Pleads Guilty to $23 Million COVID-19 Relief Fraud
A Liberian national who orchestrated a fraudulent scheme to secure more than $23 million in forgivable Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans pleaded guilty today to a federal financial crime, announced Acting U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Texas Chad E. Meacham.
Steven Jalloul, a 43-year-old tax consultant from the Dallas area, was first charged via criminal complaint in September 2020 and indicted later that month. He pleaded guilty on Tuesday to a superseding information charging him with one count of engaging in monetary transactions using property derived from unlawful activity.
“The Paycheck Protection Program was designed to help hardworking businesspeople keep their companies afloat during the pandemic – not to line the pockets of unscrupulous accountants,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Chad Meacham. “The Justice Department will prosecute anyone who attempts to exploit pandemic-era financial programs. There are countless businesses ravaged by COVID-19 that deserved this money; Mr. Jalloul did not.”
According to plea papers, Mr. Jalloul admitted he defrauded lenders participating in the Paycheck Protection Program — a measure authorized by Congress in the early days of the pandemic to award forgivable loans to small business impacted by COVID-19 — while awaiting sentencing in a separate tax fraud case.
In court documents, he admitted that he submitted roughly 170 falsified PPP loan applications to lenders (including through a fintech company) seeking more than $23 million on behalf of over 160 clients of his tax preparation business, Royalty Tax & Financial Services LLC.
Mr. Jalloul admitted he inflated clients’ employee rosters and monthly payroll expenses in order to increase the amount of PPP funds for which their businesses would be eligible.  He generally charged clients a 2 to 20 percent commission on the PPP loans they received and even listed his ex-wife as Royalty Tax’s authorized representative, without her consent, when seeking an inflated PPP loan for his own business.
In total, 97 false PPP loan applications were ultimately approved, and Mr. Jalloul’s clients were awarded more than $12 million in PPP money. Those clients paid him at least $972,114 in fees.
Mr. Jalloul now faces up to 10 years in federal prison for the PPP fraud. His sentencing date has not yet been set.
He is already behind bars at FCI-Seagoville, having pleaded guilty to tax fraud in the separate case in January 2020; in that case, he was sentenced to six years in federal prison.
The Dallas Field Offices of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of Inspector General, and the Internal Revenue Service, Criminal Investigation conducted the investigation. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Fabio Leonardi and Marty Basu are prosecuting the case. Assistant U.S. Attorney Dimitri Rocha is handling the asset-forfeiture component of the case.
The Paycheck Protection Program was authorized under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, a federal law enacted on March 29, 2020, to provide emergency financial assistance to Americans suffering economic hardship due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The PPP initially provided for up to $349 billion in forgivable loans to small businesses for payroll costs and certain other expenses, including rent; in April 2020, Congress authorized more than $300 billion in additional PPP funding. The PPP allows qualifying small businesses to receive loans with a maturity of two years and an interest rate of 1 percent. In addition, the PPP allows both the interest and principal on the loans to be forgiven if the business spends the money on qualifying expenses within a designated period of time.

Former McKinney Man Indicted for COVID-19 Relief Fraud
SHERMAN, Texas – A former McKinney man has been charged with federal violations related to his alleged participation in a scheme to file fraudulent loan applications seeking millions of dollars in forgivable Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (SBA) under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, announced Acting U.S. Attorney Nicholas J. Ganjei today.
Sinoj Kallamplackal Joseph, 42, was charged in an indictment filed in the Eastern District of Texas with seven counts of wire fraud and three counts of making false statements to a bank.  The indictment alleges that Joseph submitted fraudulent applications for over $3 million in PPP loans to an SBA-approved lender in the names of MK Analytics, LLC; Sanbi Solutions, LLC; and KMS Traders Group, LLC.  In these applications, Joseph fabricated payroll records, including the number of employees working for his companies and the amounts of his payroll costs, the indictment alleges.  The indictment also alleges that Joseph submitted fraudulent documentation in support of his applications.  If convicted, Joseph faces up to 20 years in federal prison for the wire fraud charges and up to 30 years in federal prison for making false statements to a bank.
“This indictment is the latest installment in our District’s efforts to hold accountable those who perpetrate fraud on the Paycheck Protection Program,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Nicholas J. Ganjei.  “PPP has been a vital tool for American small businesses and their employees who have struggled with the economic fallout from the pandemic.  EDTX is committed to pursuing fraudsters who have exploited this program to the detriment of others.”

New York and Florida Resident Admits to $6.8 Million Paycheck Protection Program Fraud Scheme
NEWARK, N.J. – A dual New York and Florida resident today admitted his role in a scheme to fraudulently obtain federal Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans totaling over $6.8 million, Acting U.S. Attorney Rachael A. Honig and Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Polite Jr. of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division announced today.
Gregory J. Blotnick, 34, of Florida, pleaded guilty before U.S. District Judge Brian R. Martinotti to an information charging him with one count of wire fraud and one count of money laundering.
According to documents filed in this case and statements made in court:
From April 2020 through March 2021, Blotnick submitted 21 fraudulent PPP loan applications to 13 lenders on behalf of nine purported businesses that Blotnick controlled.
The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act is a federal law enacted on March 29, 2020, designed to provide emergency financial assistance to the millions of Americans who are suffering the economic effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. One source of relief provided by the CARES Act was the authorization of up to $349 billion in forgivable loans to small businesses for job retention and certain other expenses, through the PPP. In April 2020, Congress authorized over $300 billion in additional PPP funding.
The PPP allows qualifying small businesses and other organizations to receive loans with a maturity of two years and an interest rate of 1 percent. PPP loan proceeds must be used by businesses on payroll costs, interest on mortgages, rent, and utilities. The PPP allows the interest and principal on the PPP loan to be forgiven if the business spends the loan proceeds on these expense items within a designated period of time after receiving the proceeds and uses at least a certain percentage of the PPP loan proceeds on payroll expenses.
On Blotnick’s fraudulent PPP applications, which sought a total of approximately $6.8 million in total loans, Blotnick falsified various information to the lenders, including the number of employees, the federal tax returns for his purported businesses, and payroll documentation. Blotnick obtained approximately $4.6 million in PPP funds and then misused the loan proceeds, including by transferring the funds to brokerage accounts from which he placed more than approximately $3 million in losing stock trades.
The charge of wire fraud carries a maximum potential penalty of 20 years in prison and a fine of the greater of $250,000, twice the gross profits or loss, whichever is greatest. The charge of money laundering carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine, or twice the gross gain to the defendant or gross loss to the victim, whichever is greatest. Sentencing is scheduled for March 1, 2022.
Acting U.S. Attorney Rachael Honig credited special agents of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, Office of Inspector General, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Robert Manchak; special agents of IRS – Criminal Investigation, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Michael Montanez; special agents of the Social Security Administration, Office of the Inspector General, New York Field Division, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge John F.

Judge Sentences Milwaukee Man to 45 Years’ Imprisonment for Sex Trafficking,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/judge-sentences-milwaukee-man-45-years-imprisonment-sex,"October 12, 2021",2021,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Judge Sentences Milwaukee Man to 45 Years’ Imprisonment for Sex Trafficking
Richard G. Frohling, Acting United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Wisconsin, announced that on October 4, 2021, Calvin C. Freeman, Jr. was sentenced to a term of 45 years’ imprisonment, followed by five years of supervised release after being convicted of 14 federal crimes, including sex trafficking by force, fraud, or coercion, interstate transportation for prostitution, interstate transportation of a minor for criminal sexual activity, possession of a firearm and ammunition by a felon, as well as obstruction and contempt of court.
In announcing the sentence, Chief United States District Judge Pamela Pepper recounted the decades of violence that Freeman inflicted on his victims. She cited many examples of his tactics, including incidents in which Freeman slammed one of his victims into a bathtub, put a cigarette out on a victim’s face, beat a victim with an iron, and forced a victim to continue walking the street looking for prostitution dates immediately after she had been violently raped and robbed. Judge Pepper also described Freeman’s disturbing pattern of beating his victims with a belt, noting that those beatings often left the imprint of Freeman’s designer belt buckle on their bodies. She noted that while the violence itself was “ugly” and “vicious,” the fact that Freeman used this violence to compel women to engage in commerce sex acts for his profit made it all the more egregious.
Chief Judge Pepper rejected Freeman’s arguments that his conduct was the result of his upbringing or that his victims had voluntarily entered the lifestyle and thus knew what they were signing up for. She described Freeman’s conduct as “the most heinous” example of sex trafficking she had ever seen in her career.
“The 45-year sentence reflects Mr. Freeman’s relentless criminal activity and his willingness to abuse and dehumanize others for his own financial benefit,” stated Acting U.S. Attorney Frohling. “Mr. Freeman’s conviction and sentence were the direct result of the courage and resilience shown by his victims in agreeing to testify to the abuse they suffered at his hands. Today’s sentence stems from their resolve and from the extraordinary efforts of law enforcement and the prosecution team in this case.”
“Let this 45 year prison sentence send a strong message to those who prey on victims of sex trafficking using violence and manipulation,” said Special Agent in Charge Hughes. “The FBI will utilize all resources available to bring violent offenders to justice, and provide help for victims through our Victim Assistance Program.”
Special Agent in Charge Kathy A. Enstrom stated, “The FDIC OIG’s investigation of the financial crimes in this case led to the discovery of the human trafficking ring in the Milwaukee area. Due to the diligence of the investigative team and the courage of the witnesses, Mr. Freeman was brought to justice. We appreciate the cooperation of our law enforcement partners in the investigation and prosecution of this case.”
The Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation– Office of Inspector General (FDIC-OIG), and the Milwaukee Police Department investigated the case with the assistance of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, the Philadelphia Police Department, and the Wisconsin Department of Justice Division of Criminal Investigation. Assistant United States Attorneys Erica J. Lounsberry and Julie F. Stewart prosecuted the case.

Rhode Island Man Who Sought $4.7 Million in COVID Relief Loans Sentenced for Defrauding CARES Act Paycheck Protection Program
While detained, Michael Moller also defrauded other Wyatt Detention Center inmates of more than $17,000
PROVIDENCE – For the second time in one week, a defendant has been sentenced in U.S. District Court in Providence, RI, to a significant term of incarceration in federal prison for defrauding or attempting to defraud the Paycheck Protection Program administered by the Small Business Administration (SBA) under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, announced Acting United States Attorney Richard B. Myrus.
Today, Michael C. Moller, 42, a Middletown, R.I., man previously convicted and sentenced to 108 months in federal prison for committing four armed bank robberies while on home confinement for an even earlier tax fraud conviction, was sentenced to 82 months and one day in federal prison for fraudulently seeking more than $4.7 million in Paycheck Protection Program loans and violating the terms of his term of federal supervised release.
Today’s sentence follows the October 7, 2021, resolution of criminal charges against David Adler Staveley, a/k/a Kurt David Sanborn, a/k/a David Sanborn, 54, of Andover, MA, the first person in the country charged with defrauding or attempting to defraud the Paycheck Protection Program. Staveley was sentenced to 56 months in federal prison for filing four fraudulent loan applications totaling more than $543,700 for business he did not own.
In this most recent case, an investigation by the FBI and Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation determined that, while on federal supervised release, having completed his term of incarceration on the bank robbery convictions, Michael C. Moller, 42, submitted 11 fraudulent loan applications totaling $4,725,742 in his own name, as well as in the names of his father, and in the names of his girlfriend’s son and the brother. Moller received $599,251 from these fraudulent loans, which were designed to assist small businesses that were struggling to survive because of the pandemic.
According to court records, prior to his convictions for robbing four banks and for defrauding the Paycheck Protection Program, Moller was convicted in state courts in Rhode Island and Massachusetts nine times for larceny/obtaining money under false pretenses. Additionally, he was twice convicted in federal courts on tax fraud charges.
According to court documents filed while Moller was awaiting sentencing for defrauding the Paycheck Protection Program, an FBI investigation determined that while detained at the Wyatt Detention Center, he defrauded two fellow inmates by convincing them to give him thousands of dollars in cash as payment for the services of a purported lawyer who would assist them in their criminal and immigration cases. In calls made by Moller from inside the Wyatt Detention Center and reviewed by the FBI, Moller impersonated an attorney named “Sam” and directed individuals associated with the inmates to provide his girlfriend with thousands of dollars in cash. The wife of one inmate delivered $5,000 in cash to Moller’s girlfriend; a friend of another inmate is believed to have delivered approximately $12,000 in cash. One of the victims reported that Moller told him to pack his belongings because the attorney Moller had supposedly hired had arranged for bail to be posted. Bail was never posted.
In recorded conversations between Moller and his girlfriend, and reviewed by the FBI, it was learned that the money was spent on marijuana, gambling, and on Moller’s commissary account at the Wyatt Detention Center.
Appearing today before U.S. District Court Judge Mary S. McElroy, Moller was sentenced to a total of 82 months and one day in federal prison to be followed by 3 years of federal supervised release. Moller was ordered to pay restitution to banks totaling $599,251.
The cases were prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Lee H. Vilker.
Acting United States Attorney Myrus thanks the SBA Office of Inspector General and the FDIC Office of Inspector General for their assistance in the investigation that determined that Moller had defrauded the Paycheck Protection Program.

First Person Charged for Fraudulently Seeking COVID Relief Business Loans Sentenced,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/first-person-charged-fraudulently-seeking-covid-relief-business,"October 7, 2021",2021,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

First Person Charged for Fraudulently Seeking COVID Relief Business Loans Sentenced
PROVIDENCE - A Massachusetts man who became the first person in the country charged with fraudulently seeking forgivable pandemic relief small business loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (SBA) under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, and who faked suicide shortly after his arrest resulting in a nationwide search for him by the U.S. Marshals Service, was sentenced today to 56 months in federal prison, announced Acting United States Attorney Richard B. Myrus.
David Adler Staveley, a/k/a Kurt David Sanborn, a/k/a David Sanborn, 54, of Andover, MA, conspired with David Andrew Butziger, 53, of Warwick, RI, to file four fraudulent CARES Act Paycheck Protection Program forgivable loan applications with a Rhode Island bank, falsely claiming they owned businesses with large monthly payrolls when, in fact, they did not own the businesses. Staveley admitted that as part of the scheme, on April 6, 2020, he and Butziger filed fraudulent loan applications seeking $185,570 to pay employees at Top of the Bay restaurant in Warwick, RI; $144,050 at Remington House Inn restaurant in Warwick, RI; $108,777 at On The Trax restaurant in Berlin, MA; and $105,381 to pay employees at Dock Wireless, an unincorporated business.
Staveley had no ownership interest in Top of the Bay, Remington House Inn, or On The Trax which were closed at the time the loan applications were submitted and remain closed. Dock Wireless had no employees and no wages were ever paid by the business.
Three weeks after being charged and appearing in U.S. District Court in May 2020, and released to home detention with electronic monitoring, Staveley removed his electronic monitoring device, staged his own suicide, and fled. Staveley left suicide notes with associates and left his wallet in his unlocked car that he parked along the ocean in Massachusetts. Further investigation determined that between May 26 and July 23, 2020, Staveley, who was to have appeared in federal court on June 2, 2020, traveled to various states using false identities and stolen license plates. He was apprehended by the United States Marshals Service in Alpharetta, GA., on July 23, 2020.
Appearing today before U.S. District Court Judge Mary S. McElroy, Staveley was sentenced to 56 months in federal prison to be followed by 3 years of federal supervised release.
Butziger is scheduled to be sentenced on November 1, 2021.
The cases are being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Lee H. Vilker.
The matter was investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation.
The Justice Department acknowledges and thanks the SBA Office of Inspector General and the FDIC, Office of Inspector General for their assistance in the investigation.

Lexington Man Sentenced to 27 Months for Bank Fraud and Aggravated Identity Theft
LEXINGTON, Ky.— Vonnie McDaniels, 32, of Lexington, Kentucky, was sentenced to 27 months in federal prison on Monday by Chief U.S. District Judge Danny C. Reeves, after being convicted of bank fraud and aggravated identity theft.
McDaniels obtained a $382,500 commercial loan from Kentucky Bank in August 2019 under false pretenses, and used the loan proceeds to purchase an office building in Frankfort, Kentucky that was being leased by the Commonwealth of Kentucky.  According to the evidence at trial, during the loan application process, McDaniels gave the bank falsified financial records and other information, which misrepresented his assets and liabilities, and modified key terms of the lease agreement with the state.  The state terminated the lease in December 2019.  In March 2020, McDaniels requested loan forbearance from Kentucky Bank, falsely claiming that the reason he was unable to repay the loan was that the state of Kentucky had suspended rent payments under the lease due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  To corroborate this lie about the pandemic, McDaniels fabricated a letter from a state employee purporting to suspend lease payments at the office building, and used the name and signature of that employee.
McDaniels was convicted in June 2021.
Under federal law, Defendant’s last name must serve 85 percent of his prison sentence, and upon he release from prison will be under the supervision of the U.S. Probation Office for three years.
Carlton S. Shier, IV, Acting United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Kentucky; Edward J. Gray, Acting Special Agent in Charge, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Louisville Field Office; and Kathy Enstrom, Special Agent in Charge, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of Inspector General; jointly announced the sentence.
The investigation was conducted by the FBI and FDIC-OIG.  The United States was represented by Assistant United States Attorney Paul McCaffrey.

Maryland Man Facing Federal Indictment For Fraudulently Obtaining $3.5 Millions In COVID Relief Funds,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/maryland-man-facing-federal-indictment-fraudulently-obtaining-35,"September 24, 2021",2021,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Maryland Man Facing Federal Indictment For Fraudulently Obtaining $3.5 Millions In COVID Relief Funds
Law Enforcement Seizes an Additional $1.5 Million in Alleged Fraudulent Funds
Greenbelt , Maryland – A federal grand jury has returned an indictment charging Rudolph Elwood Brooks, Jr., age 45, of Bowie, Maryland, with federal wire fraud and money laundering charges.
The indictment was announced by Acting United States Attorney for the District of Maryland Jonathan F. Lenzner; Special Agent in Charge Shimon R. Richmond of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of Inspector General (FDIC OIG); Acting Special Agent in Charge Darrell Waldon of the Internal Revenue Service - Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI), Washington, D.C. Field Office; Special Agent in Charge Thomas J. Sobocinski of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Baltimore Field Office; and Inspector General Hannibal “Mike” Ware of the U.S. Small Business Administration Office of Inspector General (SBA OIG).
The nine-count indictment charges Brooks with three counts of wire fraud relating to Brooks’ transmission of loan applications submitted through the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) in the names of three entities controlled by Brooks:  Cars Direct by Gavawn HWD Bob’s Motors (“Cars Direct”), Madaro, LLC (“Madaro”), and Kingdom Tabernacle of Restoration of Ministries (“Kingdom Tabernacle”).  As alleged in the indictment, Brooks electronically submitted PPP loan applications in the name of Cars Direct, Madaro and Kingdom Tabernacle containing false statements regarding the number of employees and payroll expenses of the entities.  In support of the PPP loan applications, Brooks also submitted false tax forms not on file with the Internal Revenue Service.
On May 9, 2020, the Cars Direct PPP loan was approved and on May 12, 2020 $1,556,589 in loan proceeds were deposited into an account controlled by Brooks.  On May 11, 2020, the Madaro PPP loan was approved and on May 13, 2020 $204,266 in loan proceeds were deposited into an account controlled by Brooks.  On May 14, 2020, the Kingdom Tabernacle PPP loan was approved and on May 15, 2020 $1.8 million in loan proceeds were deposited into an account controlled by Brooks.
In total, on the basis of the false and fraudulent PPP loan applications, Brooks obtained at least $3,560,855 in PPP loan proceeds.  Brooks used the PPP loan proceeds for his personal benefit and on payments and purchases not permissible under the Paycheck Protection Program, including payments for a residence, the purchase of a luxury vehicle, purchases at restaurants, retail stores, grocery stores, cash withdrawals and transfer to other bank accounts controlled by Brooks.
The indictment also charges Brooks with three counts of money laundering for wire transfers derived from the criminal proceeds of the PPP loans that were used for the purchase of a 2018 Tesla Model 3, a real property in Baltimore, Maryland, and a real property in Upper Marlboro, Maryland.  The indictment also charges Brooks with three counts of money laundering for the April 5, 2021 purchase of three $100,000 cashier’s check payable to “Rudolph Brooks” from the proceeds of the fraudulent PPP loans.
To date, the United States has recovered more than $1.6 million in proceeds of the fraudulent PPP loans as well as a 2018 Tesla Model 3 purchased with proceeds of the Cars Direct PPP loan.  As alleged in the indictment, if convicted, the United States will seek forfeiture of the seized property as well as the Upper Marlboro, Maryland property purchased with fraud proceeds.  The United States also filed a parallel civil forfeiture complaint against the Upper Marlboro, Maryland property on August 12, 2021 alleging that the property was purchased with more than $500,000 in proceeds traceable to the Kingdom Tabernacle and Cars Direct PPP loans.
As detailed in the indictment, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act is a federal law enacted in March 2020 to provide emergency financial assistance to the millions of Americans suffering from the economic consequences of COVID-19.  The CARES Act authorized up to $659 billion in forgivable loans to small businesses for employee retention and certain business expenses through the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”).  The business must use PPP loan proceeds on payroll costs, mortgage interest, rent, and utilities.  Initially, the program allowed the principal to be forgiven if the business spent the loan proceeds on qualifying expenses within eight weeks of loan issuance and used at least 75 percent of the loan for payroll.  On June 5, 2020, the Paycheck Protection Program Flexibility Act of 2020 went into effect.  This law extended the period from eight weeks to 24 weeks that the loan proceeds had to be spent and reduced the requirement that the loan proceeds be spent on payroll from 75 percent to 60 percent.
If convicted, Brooks faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in federal prison for wire fraud and money laundering followed by three years of supervised release.  Actual sentences for federal crimes are typically less than the maximum penalties.  A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after taking into account the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.
An indictment is not a finding of guilt.  An individual charged by indictment is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty at some later criminal proceedings.
Acting United States Attorney Jonathan F. Lenzner commended the FDIC OIG, the IRS-CI, the FBI, and the SBA OIG for their work in the investigation.  Mr. Lenzner thanked Assistant U.S. Attorneys Sean R. Delaney, Jessica C. Collins, and Jennifer L. Wine, who are prosecuting the case.
On May 17, 2021, the Attorney General established the COVID-19 Fraud Enforcement Task Force to marshal the resources of the Department of Justice in partnership with agencies across government to enhance efforts to combat and prevent pandemic-related fraud. The Task Force bolsters efforts to investigate and prosecute the most culpable domestic and international criminal actors and assists agencies tasked with administering relief programs to prevent fraud by, among other methods, augmenting and incorporating existing coordination mechanisms, identifying resources and techniques to uncover fraudulent actors and their schemes, and sharing and harnessing information and insights gained from prior enforcement efforts.

Two Former Employees at New York Branch Of Major Bank And An Accountant Charged With Cares Act Loan Fraud
Defendants Conspired with Others to Defraud a Major Bank and the Small Business Administration Out of Millions of Dollars in Federal Loan Funds
Earlier today, in federal court in Brooklyn, a criminal complaint was unsealed and two criminal informations were filed yesterday charging Anuli Okeke, Charlene Wint and Hashim Campbell, respectively, for their participation in a conspiracy to commit bank and wire fraud in connection with a scheme to fraudulently obtain more than $3 million from the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) program, both of which were created by Congress as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.  Wint and Campbell pleaded guilty on Thursday to conspiracy to commit bank and wire fraud before United States Magistrate Judge Roanne L. Mann.  Okeke was arrested this morning and made her initial appearance this afternoon before United States Magistrate Judge Robert M. Levy who released the defendant on a $100,000 bond.
Jacquelyn M. Kasulis, Acting United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York; Kenneth A. Polite, Jr., Assistant Attorney General of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division; Michael J. Driscoll, Assistant Director-in-Charge, Federal Bureau of Investigation, New York Field Office (FBI); John Grasso, Special Agent-in-Charge, Social Security Administration, Office of the Inspector General (SSA-OIG); Jay N. Lerner, Inspector General, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of Inspector General (FDIC-OIG); Stephen Donnelly, Acting Special Agent-in-Charge, Office of Inspector General for the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, Eastern Region (FRS-OIG); and Amaleka McCall-Brathwaite, Special Agent-in-Charge, Office of the Inspector General of the U.S. Small Business Administration, Eastern Region Office (SBA-OIG) announced the charges.
“As alleged, the defendants plotted to steal millions in funds that were specifically earmarked by Congress to provide emergency assistance to small businesses and vulnerable workers during a global pandemic and time of great economic hardship,” stated Acting U.S. Attorney Kasulis.  “Together with our law enforcement partners, this Office will vigorously prosecute defendants who shamelessly seek to enrich themselves by taking advantage of government programs that are designed to help those in need during the COVID crisis.”
“Fraudulent schemes exploiting the Paycheck Protection Program are unfortunately all too commonplace. Okeke, Wint, and Campbell, as charged today, join the ranks of others before them who took it upon themselves to personally and illegally benefit from the protections offered to small businesses during a global pandemic. They are likely not the last, however, and the FBI and our partners will continue to uncover more schemes of this nature and being their perpetrators to justice,” stated FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge Driscoll.
“Our office will relentlessly investigate fraud schemes and pull them out by the roots,” stated SBA-OIG Special Agent-in-Charge McCall-Brathwaite.  “SBA’s PPP and EIDL programs are intended to provide assistance to the nation’s small businesses struggling with the pandemic challenges.  I want to thank the U.S. Attorney’s Office and our law enforcement partners for their dedication and pursuit of justice.”
“The defendants in this case – two bank officials at a major financial institution and an accountant – are charged with misusing the bank’s operations for their personal benefit, in order to fraudulently obtain Government-guaranteed loans [which were intended to help small businesses during the current pandemic].  We remain committed to working with our law enforcement partners in investigating such cases where individuals seek to exploit Federal relief programs and threaten to undermine the integrity of our nation's banks,” stated FDIC Inspector General Lerner.
“We are fully committed to holding accountable any wrongdoers whose fraudulent actions impact the Federal Reserve Board’s ability to assist small businesses under the Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility,” stated FRS-OIG Special Agent-in-Charge Donnelly.
The CARES Act is a federal law enacted on March 29, 2020 to provide emergency financial assistance in connection with economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.  One source of relief provided by the CARES Act was the allocation of funds for the issuance of forgivable loans to small businesses for job retention and certain other expenses through the PPP.  The PPP allowed qualifying small businesses to receive unsecured loans on favorable terms, which they were required to use for specified expenses, including payroll costs, interest on mortgages, rent and utilities.  The PPP provided for forgiveness of the loan if recipient businesses spent the proceeds on these specified expenses within a limited time period and used a certain percentage for payroll costs.
Another source of relief provided by the CARES Act was the EIDL program, which provided low-interest financing to small businesses, renters and homeowners in regions affected by declared disasters.  Under the program, EIDL recipients were eligible to receive advances of up to $10,000 for small businesses within three days of applying for an EIDL (EIDL Advance).  The amount of an EIDL Advance was determined based on the number of employees working for the applicant.  The EIDL Advance did not have to be repaid.
As alleged in the charging documents, Okeke, a branch manager at a large financial institution, Wint, a supervisor at the same branch, and Campbell, a tax preparer, along with their co-conspirators, provided false tax documents and helped borrowers to complete and submit PPP applications that contained fraudulent information.  Despite knowing that the PPP applications contained false statements, Okeke signed each PPP loan application on behalf of the bank and submitted them for approval.  Once the loan proceeds were disbursed to the borrowers, Okeke, Wint, Campbell and their co-conspirators received kickbacks from the loan proceeds.  Moreover, Okeke, Wint, Campbell and their co-conspirators were involved in preparing fraudulent EIDL applications that fabricated borrower’s financials, and at times sought loans for individuals who were not legitimate business owners.
The charges in the complaint are allegations, and Okeke is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.
The government’s case is being handled by the Office’s Business and Securities Fraud Section and the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section.  Assistant United States Attorneys Julia Nestor, Chand Edwards-Balfour, and Lindsay Gerdes of the Eastern District of New York, and Trial Attorney Michael McCarthy of the Fraud Section are in charge of the prosecution, with assistance from Assistant United States Attorney Brian D. Morris of the Office’s Asset Forfeiture Section.

ANULI OKEKE Age: 49 Bronx, New York
CHARLENE WINT Age: 54 Bronx, New York
HASHIM CAMPBELL Age: 41 New York, New York

Farm Equipment CEO Sentenced to Prison, Order to Pay $6.3 Million Restitution
VALDOSTA, Ga. – A Southwest Georgia businessman and owner of a tractor supply company who pleaded guilty to orchestrating a complicated fraud involving millions of dollars of loans by multiple creditors was sentenced to prison and ordered to pay restitution to his victims for his crime.
Rickey Carter, 60, of Nashville, Georgia, was sentenced to serve 63 months in prison to be followed by five years of supervised release by U.S. District Judge Hugh Lawson on Wednesday, September 15, after he pleaded guilty to bank fraud. The court also sentenced Carter to pay more than $6.3 million in monetary restitution to the banks and creditors who were defrauded, as well as to the U.S. Small Business Administration. There is no parole in the federal system.
“Defrauding banks by lying to obtaining millions of dollars in loans undercuts the integrity of the banking system and puts businesses--and the people they employ--in jeopardy,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Peter D. Leary. “Our office and law enforcement will work to hold fraudsters accountable and protect citizens from fraud.”
“This sentencing recognizes the importance of holding the defendant accountable for orchestrating a fraudulent scheme to obtain millions of dollars in loans from these banks,” said Special Agent in Charge, Kyle A. Myles of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC-OIG). “The FDIC-OIG remains committed to working with our law enforcement partners to investigate financial crimes that threaten the integrity of the banking sector.”
“No matter how elaborate or complicated the fraud scheme, the FBI and our federal partners will uncover and unravel it to protect American citizens and businesses from further damage and work to recoup their losses,” said Chris Hacker, Special Agent in Charge of FBI Atlanta. “Carter will be held accountable for the damage he has done, sending a message that fraud is a serious crime with serious consequences.”
Carter was the President and CEO of Nashville Tractor (NTI), a business that sold and leased agricultural and construction equipment, attachments and parts. In 2016, he obtained a United States Small Business Administration (SBA) loan with Farmers and Merchants Bank (FMB) in the principal amount of $5,000,000. At the same time, NTI obtained a new line of credit and signed a credit agreement with FMB in the amount of $625,000.
In 2010, Carter had entered into an ongoing Wholesale Financing and Security Agreement with CNH Industrial Capital America, LLC, (CNH) to finance NTI’s purchases of inventory for retail sale or lease. He also entered into a Retail Financing Agreement (RFA) with CNH under which CNH would purchase NTI’s interest in retail installment contracts for the purchase of agricultural and construction equipment with retail customers. The CNH agreement was a primary source of farm and construction equipment inventory for NTI.
Carter was able to continue operations of NTI and other loan arrangements were made with a number of other banks and financing entities. In each instance of a loan with the banks, Carter was required to provide true and complete financial information to the banks and was to provide continuing information for line of credit draws. However, during 2015, NTI began having financial and cash flow issues which made it difficult to make payments due on the loans and to make payroll. During that time, Carter began a practice of selling equipment which it held in trust but not paying the cash over to CNH and other creditors as required. Carter sold at least 88 pieces of equipment valued at more than $1.5 million subject to the security interest of CNH and sold other pieces of equipment securing financing from Kubota Credit Corporation, Ameris Bank, Bank of Alapaha and Diversified Financial Services. As part of the fraudulent scheme, Carter falsified NTI’s financial records in order to inflate the company’s net worth. As a part of falsifying records, on occasion Carter directed NTI employees to generate payments checks on accounts payable but not send the checks, thereby reducing accounts payable but not deducting the checks from NTI’s accounts. In 2016, Carter falsified documents provided to FMB to secure the SBA loan and line of credit.
Carter also created fraudulent retail installment contracts for the sale or lease of numerous items of equipment with CNH using the names of real people whose information was available to Carter. Those fraudulent contracts generated more than $1.2 million in payments to NTI.
Carter continued through the SBA loan period to provide false and fraudulent information. In total, Carter admitted to being accountable for an intended fraud loss totaling more than $3.5 million but not more than $9.5 million. Carter is responsible for restitution for actual monetary losses caused by the fraud to FMB ($1,227,319.66), SBA ($1,500,000), Ameris Bank ($321,934.50), Bank of Alapaha ($150,000), CNH ($2,782,959.99), KCC ($185,993.32) and Diversified Financial Services ($228,399.92).
The case was investigated by the FBI and FDIC-OIG.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert McCullers prosecuted the case.

Texas Wedding Planner Sentenced in COVID-19 Fraud Scheme
A Texas man was sentenced today in the Eastern District of Texas to 31 months in prison and three years of supervised release for perpetrating a scheme to fraudulently obtain more than $3.3 million in Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (SBA) under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.
According to court documents, Fahad Shah, 45, of Murphy, who pleaded guilty to wire fraud, sought approximately $3.3 million in PPP funds by claiming that his family’s business, WBF Weddings by Farah Inc. (WBF), employed more than 100 individuals and paid millions of dollars in compensation to those employees. In actuality, WBF had no employees aside from Shah and his wife. Based on Shah’s false representations and forged documents, an SBA-approved lender provided over $1.5 million in PPP loan funds to Shah. Shah then used the funds for personal gain contrary to program’s terms, paying off his home mortgage and purchasing two Teslas and a Mercedes, among other items.

Nigerian National Pleads Guilty to Role in Fraud and Money Laundering Scheme
HUNTINGTON, W.Va. – A Nigerian national who was indicted in April 2021 in connection with a large fraud and money laundering scheme pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit money laundering.
According to court documents and statements made in connection with the plea hearing, Kenneth Ogudu, also known as Kenneth Lee, 28, a citizen of Nigeria residing in Columbus, Ohio, was involved from at least May 2019 to October 8, 2020, with Kenneth Emeni, John Nassy, Romello Thorpe, Oluwagbenga Harrison, Ouluwabamishe Awolesi, and others in a money laundering conspiracy that took place in Huntington, West Virginia and elsewhere.  Ogudu lived in Huntington from May to December 2019.  As part of the scheme, co-conspirators created online false personas and contacted victims via email, text messaging or online dating and social media websites in order to induce the victims into believing they were in a romantic relationship, friendship or business relationship with various false personas. The victims were persuaded to send money for a variety of false and fraudulent reasons for the benefit of the false personas. Ogudu’s role in the conspiracy was to let victims transfer money to his bank account that he knew was from unlawful activity.  Ogudu admitted that after the victims’ funds were deposited into his account, he kept some of the money for himself and forwarded some of the money to his co-conspirators via wire transfers or Zelle.  Ogudu further admitted that he and his co-conspirators transferred large sums of their fraud proceeds to offshore accounts. Ogudu obtained funds from at least 12 different fraud victims during the money laundering conspiracy.
Ogudu faces up to 20 years in prison when he is sentenced on December 13, 2021.  As part of  his plea agreement, Ogudu agreed to pay $324,865.85 in restitution.
Acting United States Attorney Lisa G. Johnston made the announcement and commended the investigative work of the United States Secret Service, the United States Postal Inspection Service, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation-Office of Inspector General (FDIC-OIG), the West Virginia State Police, and the South Charleston Police Department.

According to court documents, Bischoff, who owned multiple pizza restaurants in Macomb County, admitted to defrauding several financial institutions by submitting at least nine falsified PPP loan applications that included false representations about payroll, business expenses, and the number of employees working at his restaurants. To help secure the PPP loans, Bischoff also submitted multiple fabricated tax documents and fraudulently used another person’s personal identifying information. In total, Bischoff fraudulently sought approximately $931,000 in COVID-19 relief funds and received approximately $593,590. In addition to his prison sentence, Bischoff was ordered to serve three years of supervised release, and to pay $593,590 in restitution and a $5,000 fine.

West L.A. Man Pleads Guilty to Fraudulently Obtaining Approximately $9 Million in COVID-Relief Loans, Some of Which Was Gambled Away
LOS ANGELES – A West Los Angeles man pleaded guilty today to federal charges stemming from a scheme that used a series of corporations he controlled to fraudulently obtain approximately $9 million in loans from COVID-relief programs, some of which he used on gambling excursions to Las Vegas and transferred to his stock trading accounts.
Andrew Marnell, 41, who resides in the Beverly Grove neighborhood, pleaded guilty to one count of bank fraud and one count of money laundering.
Marnell admitted that he fraudulently obtained Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (SBA) under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. Marnell obtained seven PPP loans from financial institutions for corporations he controlled that brought him just under $9 million.
Marnell submitted fraudulent loan applications that made numerous false and misleading statements about the companies’ business operations and payroll expenses. Marnell, often using aliases, submitted fake and altered documents, including bogus federal tax filings and employee payroll records.
The PPP program was implemented by the CARES Act, which was signed into law in March 2020 and was designed to provide relief to businesses affected by the coronavirus pandemic. The CARES Act also provided funding to The Economic Injury Disaster Loan Program (EIDL) administered by the SBA. Marnell admitted that he fraudulently obtained $170,000 in EIDL loans.
Once the loans were funded, Marnell transferred millions of dollars from the fraudulently obtained loan proceeds to his brokerage accounts to make risky stock market bets, according to court documents, which note that Marnell spent hundreds of thousands of dollars in fraudulently obtained loan proceeds at various gambling establishments.
As part of the plea agreement, Marnell agreed to forfeit items related to the pilfered PPP loan funds, including more than $1.54 million seized from several brokerage accounts, $319,298 in cash recovered from his residence, numerous electronic devices, a Rolex Oyster watch, a Range Rover and a Ducati motorcycle.
As a result of his guilty pleas, Marnell will face a statutory maximum sentence of 40 years in federal prison when he is sentenced by United States District Judge R. Gary Klausner on February 14, 2022. In addition to any prison sentence he receives, Marnell has agreed to pay restitution to the victim lenders to compensate the losses this case, an amount believed to be $7,341,376.
Marnell has been in custody since his arrest in this matter on July 16, 2020.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency’s Office of Inspector General, the FBI, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s Office of Inspector General, IRS Criminal Investigation, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, and the Small Business Administration’s Office of Inspector General investigated this matter. The California Department of Justice’s Bureau of Gambling Control provided valuable assistance.
Assistant United States Attorney Kerry Quinn of the Major Frauds Section and Justice Department Trial Attorney Scott Armstrong of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section are prosecuting this case.
In May, the Attorney General established the COVID-19 Fraud Enforcement Task Force to marshal the resources of the Department of Justice in partnership with agencies across government to enhance efforts to combat and prevent pandemic-related fraud. The Task Force bolsters efforts to investigate and prosecute the most culpable domestic and international criminal actors and assists agencies tasked with administering relief programs to prevent fraud by, among other methods, augmenting and incorporating existing coordination mechanisms, identifying resources and techniques to uncover fraudulent actors and their schemes, and sharing and harnessing information and insights gained from prior enforcement efforts.

Litchfield Man Sentenced to 36 Months in Prison for Defrauding Banks
SPRINGFIELD, Ill. – Wayne H. Kruger, 73, of Litchfield, Illinois, was sentenced on September 9, 2021, to 36 months in federal prison, to be followed by 5 years of supervised release, for defrauding several banks in Central Illinois.
Kruger pleaded guilty to three counts of bank fraud on February 22, 2021. According to court documents, Kruger admitted that beginning in December 2010 and continuing through about May 2012, he attempted to execute or executed schemes to defraud banks including the Carlinville, Illinois, National Bank and Trust Company; the State Bank of Cerro Gordo, Illinois; and the State Bank of Bement, Illinois, resulting in a total loss of $4,185,957.  Kruger, then the president and owner of Ponder Equipment Company, Inc., a bus dealer, regularly sold buses “out of trust.” This fraudulent practice involves a dealership – here, Ponder – selling a bus that has been paid for with loan proceeds but failing to use the sale proceeds to pay back the lender. When Kruger sold a bus and failed to repay the associated loan, the relevant bank was unable to seize the loan collateral because it no longer existed as an asset of the business.
At the sentencing hearing, U.S. District Court Judge Richard Mills noted that Kruger’s scheme affected small banks in communities built on personal relationships and trust. The judge also ordered restitution for all three banks in the amount of $4,185,957.
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General investigated the case. Assistant U.S. Attorney Timothy A. Bass represented the government in the prosecution.

Three South Florida Men Guilty of Conspiring to Launder Fraudulently Obtained Covid-19 Relief Money and Proceeds from Business Email Compromise Schemes,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/three-south-florida-men-guilty-conspiring-launder-fraudulently,"September 2, 2021",2021,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Three South Florida Men Guilty of Conspiring to Launder Fraudulently Obtained Covid-19 Relief Money and Proceeds from Business Email Compromise Schemes
Miami, Florida – Yesterday, Broward County residents Jimpcy One, 35, Gousman Lemy, 42, and Frantz Guillaume, Jr. a/k/a Sandro Saintfloeur, 44, pled guilty in federal district court to conspiring with each other to launder proceeds obtained from business email compromise schemes and fraudulently obtained Covid-19 relief loans.  Each defendant admitted to laundering close to $2 million dollars to disguise the nature and source of the illicit funds.
A business email compromise scheme is a type of computer intrusion that occurs when an employee of a company is fooled into interacting with an email message that appears to be, but is not, legitimate.  The bogus email usually contains either an attachment or a link to a malicious website or program.  When an unwitting user clicks on either the link or the attachment, it releases some form of malware (i.e., a virus, spyware, or other program application) that subsequently infects the employee’s email and/or computer.  The malware may affect an employee’s individual account or spread throughout the computer network.  The malware, once executed, can harvest information including but not limited to credentials and passwords, thereby giving the intruder access to sensitive company information.
According to court documents, in July of 2017, Lemy and Guillaume laundered a little over $425,000 obtained from a business email compromise of a Texas based university.  Then, in 2019, One joined Lemy, and Guillaume in laundering over $900,000 obtained from a business email compromise of another U.S. based victim company. In each business email compromise scheme, co-conspirators sent false and fraudulent emails from a hacked account which tricked the victims into wiring money into accounts controlled by the defendants and their co-conspirators.  One, Gousman, and Lemy then sought to conceal the origin of this fraudulently obtained money by transferring it among the bank accounts of various shell companies that One, Gousman, and Lemy controlled.
When the coronavirus pandemic hit the United States in 2020, One, Gousman, and Lemy allegedly initiated a new fraud scheme using existing shell companies from the email compromise scheme, as well as newly created and reactivated shell companies. Defendants allegedly submitted false and fraudulent loan applications under two U.S. government relief programs authorized by the CARES Act to help small businesses and their employees survive the Covid-19 economic crisis: the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan Program (“EIDL”).  In June and July 2020, through false submissions in the names of their shell companies, One, Gousman, and Lemy fraudulently applied for and received close to $2 million in PPP and EIDL funds, which was laundered amongst the co-conspirators.
U.S. District Judge Rodolfo A. Ruiz, who sits in Ft. Lauderdale, will sentence these defendants on November 18, 2021, at 9:30 a.m.  Each defendant faces up to 20 years in federal prison.
Juan Antonio Gonzalez, Acting United States Attorney for the Southern District of Florida; George L. Piro, Special Agent in Charge, FBI Miami; Kyle A. Myles, Special Agent in Charge, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC-OIG), Atlanta Region; and Amaleka McCall-Brathwaite, U.S. Small Business Administration, Investigations Division (SBA-OIG), Eastern Regional Office made the announcement.
FBI Miami, FDIC-OIG, and SBA-OIG handled the investigation, with assistance from the United States Secret Service Miami Field Office and the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration Cybercrimes Division.  Assistant U.S. Attorney Brooke Watson is prosecuting the case.

Two South Florida Lawyers and Former Chief Operating Officer Sentenced for Roles in Massive 1 Global Capital Investment Scheme
Miami, Florida – Two south Florida securities lawyers and the former Chief Operating Officer of 1 Global Capital LLC (“1 Global”) were sentenced for their roles in a sprawling fraud scheme that affected more than 3,600 investors in 42 states.
Andrew Dale Ledbetter, 79, of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, pled guilty to a single count information, charging him with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and securities fraud, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 371 (Case No. 20-CR-60103), and was sentenced today to 60 months in prison by U.S. District Judge Roy K. Altman.  Ledbetter was also ordered to pay over $148,976,248 million in restitution to the victims of the scheme.
Steven Allen Schwartz, 76, of Delray Beach, Florida, pled guilty to a single count information, charging him with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and securities fraud, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 371 (Case No. 20-CR-60003), and on July 9, 2021, U.S. District Court Judge Roy K. Altman sentenced Schwartz to a term of imprisonment of 24 months.  Schwartz was also ordered to pay over $36 million in restitution to the victims of the scheme.
Jan Douglas Atlas, 76, of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, pled guilty to a single count information, charging him with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and securities fraud, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 371 (Case No. 19-CR-60258), and on August 20, 2021, U.S. District Court Judge Roy K. Altman sentenced Atlas to a term of imprisonment of 8 months.  Atlas was also ordered to pay over $29 million in restitution to the victims of the scheme.
According to court documents, 1 Global was a commercial lending business based in Hallandale Beach, Florida, that made the equivalent of “pay day” loans to small businesses at high interest rates, termed merchant cash advance loans (“MCAs”).  Schwartz was a director and consultant at 1 Global, and also held out as a Chief Operating Officer in the company’s marketing materials.  Ledbetter was an attorney licensed in the State of Florida who had an of counsel position at Law Firm #1 and acted in a fundraising capacity at 1 Global beginning in or around 2015.  Atlas was a partner at Law Firm #1 and acted as outside counsel for 1 Global.
Substantial questions arose during the operation of the business as to whether 1 Global was offering or selling a security and whether the investment offering was required to be registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  These questions were raised by investors, investment advisors, and regulators.  Ledbetter and Atlas knew that if 1 Global’s investment offering were determined to be a security, it would undermine the ability of 1 Global to raise funds from retail investors and to continue to operate without substantial additional expenses and reporting requirements.  Such a classification would undermine the profits and fees that Ledbetter and other principals at 1 Global would be able to obtain from 1 Global’s operations.
At the request of 1 Global’s principals, Atlas authored two opinion letters in 2016 containing false information that Atlas allegedly knew would be used by 1 Global to operate the business unlawfully.  The opinion letters falsely described the duration of the investment, among other things, omitting the automatic renewal aspect and that the investment was being targeted toward retail, non-sophisticated investors (such as IRA account holders).   Ledbetter used and relied on Atlas’s opinion letters to continue to raise money illegally, in numerous pitches and communications to investment advisors and investors.
According to court documents, Ledbetter was personally involved in raising more than $100 million in investor funds that went to 1 Global, through his own pitches as well as through investment advisors he attracted to 1 Global.  Over the years, Ledbetter received approximately $3 million from 1 Global, the majority of which was for commissions.  Atlas received approximately $627,000 from Ledbetter’s commissions.  Neither attorney disclosed these commissions to Law Firm #1.  Ledbetter routinely held himself out to investors and investment advisers as outside counsel to 1 Global, and also personally vouched for 1 Global in pitches and marketing materials, without disclosing his extravagant commissions.
In addition, in order to attract investments, Individual #1 (the de facto owner of 1 Global), Schwartz, Ledbetter, and others, made false and misleading representations to investors and potential investors as to the profitability of 1 Global’s business in marketing materials and periodic account statements.
Alan G. Heide, the former 1 Global Chief Financial Officer, was previously charged via information and sentenced to 60 months (Case No. 19-CR-60231).  Information about the related cases can be found here: https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdfl/1Global-Capital .

Life Insurance Trustees Charged
With Bank Fraud
HAMMOND- Ricky Blaylock, age 60, of Riverside, IL and Jacqueline Blaylock Wisnewski, age 57, of Indianapolis, Indiana, were charged with bank fraud related to their theft of insurance proceeds held in trust accounts designated for the benefit of their eight-year-old grandchild.
According to the indictment, the insurance proceeds were derived from a life insurance policy held by the defendant’s son Jacob, an active-duty soldier, who passed away in late 2007.  Jacob’s will named his eight-year-old daughter as his sole heir.   Under the terms of his will, the assets of the estate were to be held in trust for his daughter until she was 21 years old.  The will designated Jacob’s parents, Ricky Blaylock as executor of the estate and Jacqueline Blaylock as the trustee. The only asset in Jacob’s estate was the $400,000 life insurance policy. The indictment alleges that defendants funneled part of the insurance proceeds into trust accounts designated for the benefit of their grandchild but then proceeded to deplete the accounts from March 2008 through 2011, without ever making a distribution to or for the benefit of the child.
The United States Attorney’s Office emphasizes that an indictment is merely an allegation, and that all persons are presumed innocent until, and unless proven guilty in court.
If convicted, any specific sentence to be imposed will be determined by the Judge after a consideration of federal statutes and the Federal Sentencing Guidelines.
This case is being investigated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation-Office of Inspector General and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  This case is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Diane Berkowitz.

Washington Tech Executive Sentenced for Covid-19 Relief Fraud Scheme
A Washington state tech executive was sentenced today in the Western District of Washington to two years in prison for perpetrating a scheme to fraudulently obtain COVID-19 disaster relief loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (SBA) through the Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) and the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act.
Mukund Mohan, 48, of Clyde Hill, pleaded guilty to charges of wire fraud and money laundering on March 15 . According to court documents, Mohan sought more than $5.5 million through eight fraudulent disaster loan applications. In support of the fraudulent loan applications, Mohan submitted fake and altered documents, including fake federal tax filings and altered incorporation documents. For example, Mohan misrepresented to a lender that, in 2019, his company Mahenjo Inc. had dozens of employees and paid millions of dollars in employee wages and payroll taxes. In support of Mahenjo’s loan application, Mohan submitted false incorporation documents and tax forms suggesting that the company had been in business prior to 2020. In truth, Mohan purchased Mahenjo in May 2020 and at the time he purchased the company, it had no employees and no business activity. The incorporation documents that he submitted to the lender were altered and the federal tax filings he submitted were fake. Five of Mohan’s eight fraudulent loan applications were approved, and he fraudulently obtained nearly $1.8 million in COVID-19 relief funds.
In addition to the prison sentence, Mohan was ordered to pay a fine in the amount of $100,000 and $1,786,357 in restitution.

Texas Man Pleads Guilty to Wire Fraud for Foreign Exchange Investment Fraud Scheme
A Texas man pleaded guilty today in the Southern District of Texas to defrauding investors that he solicited via social media by falsely promising high rates of return and low or no-risk returns on foreign exchange investments.
According to court documents, Kelvin Ramirez, 25, of Houston, used social media platforms to falsely promote himself as a successful trader of foreign exchange investments or “forex” and attract investors. Through his Instagram accounts, Ramirez marketed “investment groups” and “private accounts” that purportedly traded in forex and were managed by Ramirez. For both types of investments, Ramirez solicited individuals by falsely promising high returns on investments, making false representations about the risk associated with the investments and falsely guaranteeing returns on investment. Through his scheme, Ramirez fraudulently obtained more than $650,000 from over 100 individuals, and then used investors’ funds for personal expenses.
Ramirez pleaded guilty to wire fraud. He is scheduled to be sentenced on Nov. 9 and faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison.

Former Marshall University Student Pleads Guilty to Role in Fraud and Money Laundering Scheme
CHARLESTON, W.Va. – One of eight individuals indicted in April 2021 in connection with a large fraud and money laundering scheme pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit money laundering.
According to court documents and statements made in connection with the plea hearing, Romello Thorpe, 25, of Washington, D.C., was involved from at least September 2019 to January 2, 2020, with Kenneth Emeni, John Nassy, Kenneth Ogudu, Oluwagbenga Harrison, Ouluwabamishe Awolesi, and others in a money laundering conspiracy that took place in Huntington, West Virginia and elsewhere.  Thorpe was a student at Marshall University and living in Huntington at the time he conspired to commit money laundering.  As part of the scheme, co-conspirators created online false personas and contacted victims via email, text messaging or online dating and social media websites in order to induce the victims into believing they were in a romantic relationship, friendship or business relationship with various false personas. The victims were persuaded to send money for a variety of false and fraudulent reasons for the benefit of the false personas.  Thorpe admitted that his role in the conspiracy was to let victims transfer money to his bank account and that he knew the funds being deposited into his account were from unlawful activity.  Thorpe further admitted that after the victims’ funds were deposited into his account, he kept some of the money for himself and forwarded some of the money to his co-conspirators via wire transfers or Zelle.  Thorpe admitted that he obtained funds from at least six different fraud victims during the money laundering conspiracy.
Thorpe faces up to 20 years in prison when he is sentenced on November 22, 2021.  As part of  his plea agreement, Thorpe agreed to pay $69,850 in restitution.
Acting United States Attorney Lisa G. Johnston made the announcement and commended the investigative work of the United States Secret Service, the United States Postal Inspection Service, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation-Office of Inspector General (FDIC-OIG), the West Virginia State Police, and the South Charleston Police Department.

Maryland Man Sentenced to 7 ½-Year Prison Term For Fraud, Money Laundering, and Identity Theft Scheme
Scams Targeted Companies and Individuals
WASHINGTON – Kelvin Otunyo, 37, of Hyattsville, Md., was sentenced today to 90 months in prison on federal charges stemming from his role in at least six schemes to deposit and launder stolen and unauthorized checks valued at more than $350,000.
The announcement was made by Acting U.S. Attorney Channing D. Phillips, Robert E. Bornstein, Acting Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Washington Field Office, Criminal Division, and Special Agent in Charge Shimon R. Richmond, of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC OIG).
Otunyo, a Nigerian national, pleaded guilty on April 1, 2021, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, to two counts of bank fraud, one count of aggravated identity theft, and two counts of conspiracy to commit money laundering. He was sentenced by the Honorable Chief Judge Beryl A. Howell. Following his prison term, he will be placed on four years of supervised release. Otunyo also was ordered to pay a restitution judgment in the amount of $124,157, and a forfeiture money judgment in the amount of $303,207.
According to court papers, between August 2017 and at least August 2018, Otunyo and co-conspirators engaged in a series of schemes in which they obtained stolen or unauthorized checks from victims, established fraudulent shell corporations and bank accounts, and deposited or attempted to deposit the checks before laundering the resulting proceeds.  The frauds were committed using false IDs and fraudulent aliases. Otunyo also procured the real name and Social Security number of an identity theft victim for use in one of the schemes.
In total, the six schemes involved nine stolen or unauthorized checks from eight victims totaling $355,745.29.
As part of the larger investigation of Otunyo and others involved in laundering the proceeds of various frauds, business email compromises, and bad check schemes, at least three other defendants have been charged. In June 2019, Chief Judge Howell sentenced Michael Orji, 42, formerly of Washington D.C, to 10 years of incarceration, five years of supervised release, and $905,274 in restitution.  One of Otunyo’s co-conspirators, Samson Olawale Afolabi, 36, of Hyattsville, Md., has pleaded guilty and is awaiting sentencing on Oct. 1, 2021.  Another defendant, Jamar Skeete, 37, of Washington, D.C., has been indicted in connection with similar, related fraud and money laundering; he has pleaded not guilty to charges.
The case was investigated by the FBI’s Washington Field Office and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation-Office of Inspector General. Assistance was provided by the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security-Homeland Security Investigations. The case was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Christopher B. Brown and Charles Willoughby, Jr., with assistance from Paralegal Specialists Chad Byron, Rhonda Richardson, and former Paralegal Specialist C. Rosalind Pressley.

Jury Convicts Five Former Officers and Employees of Banc-Serv Partners in $5 Million Scheme to Defraud the Small Business Administration,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/jury-convicts-five-former-officers-and-employees-banc-serv,"August 5, 2021",2021,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Jury Convicts Five Former Officers and Employees of Banc-Serv Partners in $5 Million Scheme to Defraud the Small Business Administration
A federal jury convicted five former officers and employees of Banc-Serv Partners LLP (Banc-Serv) — a lending service provider — in a 13-year conspiracy to defraud the Small Business Administration (SBA) in connection with its programs to guarantee loans made to small businesses.
According to the evidence presented at trial, the defendants — Kerri Agee, 46, of Noblesville, Indiana, former president, chief executive officer and founder of Banc-Serv; Kelly Isley, 40, of Westfield, Indiana, Banc-Serv’s former chief operating officer; Nicole Smith, 44, of Indianapolis, Indiana, a former Banc-Serv employee; Chad Griffin, 48, of Carmel, Indiana, Banc-Serv’s former chief marketing officer; and Matthew Smith, 52, of Westfield, Indiana, Banc-Serv’s co-founder and a former director of a lending institution that originated loans with Banc-Serv — fraudulently obtained SBA-guaranteed loans on behalf of their clients, knowing that the loans did not meet SBA’s guidelines and requirements for the guarantees. The evidence at trial proved that from approximately 2004 until October 2017, the defendants helped originate SBA loans on behalf of various financial institutions and other lenders and, on multiple occasions, fraudulently obtained guarantees for loans that the SBA had deemed ineligible. They did so by, among other things, knowingly misrepresenting what the loans would be used for and unlawfully diverting previously denied loan applications into expedited approval channels at the SBA. When the fraudulently guaranteed loans defaulted, the defendants caused the submission of the reimbursement requests to the SBA to purchase the defaulted loans from investors and lending institutions, thereby shifting some of the losses on the ineligible loans to the SBA.
The fraudulent loans presented at trial totaled approximately $5 million in guaranteed disbursements, which were not eligible for SBA guarantees.
Agee was convicted of one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud affecting a financial institution and four counts of wire fraud affecting a financial institution. Isley was convicted of one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud affecting a financial institution and two counts of wire fraud affecting a financial institution. Nicole Smith was convicted of one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud affecting a financial institution and two counts of wire fraud affecting a financial institution. Griffin was convicted of one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud affecting a financial institution. Matthew Smith was convicted of one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud.
The defendants convicted of conspiracy or fraud affecting a financial institution face a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison per count. The charge of conspiracy to commit wire fraud carries a maximum sentence of 20 years. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence for each of these defendants after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.
Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Polite Jr. of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division; Inspector General Jay N. Lerner of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC-OIG); Special Agent in Charge Paul Keenan of the FBI Indianapolis Field Office; and Inspector General Hannibal “Mike” Ware of the Small Business Administration Office of Inspector General (SBA-OIG) made the announcement.
The FDIC-OIG, the FBI and the SBA-OIG investigated the case. This case is being prosecuted by Assistant Chief William E. Johnston and Trial Attorney Vasanth Sridharan of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section. Trial Attorney Brandon Burkart provided significant assistance. The Department of Housing and Urban Development Office of Inspector General also assisted in the investigation.
The Criminal Division’s Fraud Section plays a pivotal role in the Justice Department’s fight against white collar crime around the country.

International Wholesale Currency Dealer Pleads Guilty to Unlawfully Operating in the United States,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/international-wholesale-currency-dealer-pleads-guilty-unlawfully,"July 29, 2021",2021,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Wholesale Currency Dealer Pleads Guilty to Unlawfully Operating in the United States
Assistant U. S. Attorneys Michael A. Deshong, Daniel C. Silva, and Carl Brooker (619) 546-9290
NEWS RELEASE SUMMARY—July 29, 2021
SAN DIEGO—GPOMCT Grupo Empresarial S.A. de C.V., an international, Mexico-based wholesale currency dealer and currency exchange business, pleaded guilty in federal court today to unlawfully operating in the United States. Through its subsidiaries, GPOMCT controls more than 40 locations in Mexico that handle an average of over $1 million in U.S. currency daily.
Special Agents from Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) led the investigation into hundreds of transactions that involved GPOMCT importing large volumes of U.S. dollars into the United States between 2019 and 2021. Agents from Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General assisted HSI in its investigation.
As admitted in the plea agreement entered today before U.S. Magistrate Judge Michael S. Berg, GPOMCT imported shipments of currency from Mexico into the United States for the purposes of selling Mexican pesos to a currency exchange located in San Ysidro, California, identified only as “MSB 1” in the plea agreement. Between September 2019 and September 2020, GPOMCT imported approximately 195 shipments of currency—each worth between $90,000 and $100,000 in U.S. dollars—and delivered them to MSB 1 in San Ysidro. GPOMCT used the services of an armored car company to collect currency from MSB 1 as payment and deliver it to a third-party intermediary in Miami, Florida.
By offering a variety of services as a wholesale currency dealer, GPOMCT admitted that it operated as an unlicensed money transmitting business in the United States and agreed to criminally forfeit $1.1 million as property involved in its unlawful operations. By failing to register as a money transmitting business, GPOMCT did not file currency and transactional reports with the Department of the Treasury, as required by the Bank Secrecy Act, nor did it subject itself to inspection by the Department of Treasury for compliance with these financial laws and regulations.
Acting U.S. Attorney Randy S. Grossman said, “Financial laws and regulations are not a suggestion. They are significant tools to combat international money laundering, tax evasion, and other crimes. Financial institutions that operate in the United States of America should learn from the crimes committed by GPOMCT. This office will continue to demand the highest level of compliance from financial institutions in the Southern District of California.” Grossman praised prosecutors Michael Deshong, Daniel Silva, and Carl Brooker as well as agents from Homeland Security Investigations and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation for their excellent work on this case.
During the course of the investigation, agents also learned that GPOMCT used the services of an armored car company—and the armored car company’s Mexican affiliate—to import U.S. dollars into the United States and deliver them to third parties around the United States on hundreds of occasions between January 2019 and February 2021. These third parties would convert the U.S. dollars to Mexican pesos and electronically transmit the funds back to GPOMCT in Mexico, thereby completing the wholesale currency cycle.
GPOMCT has since registered as a money services business, or MSB, and acknowledged that it is now expected to comply with all U.S. statutes and regulations, including anti-money laundering requirements.
Cardell T. Morant, Special Agent in Charge for Homeland Security Investigations, San Diego, stated, “HSI is committed to protecting the integrity of the U.S. financial system by holding Money Service Businesses  accountable for the registration and reporting requirements necessary to ensure transparency. Companies or individuals that import, transport, or transfer large amounts of currency without complying with reporting requirements create opportunities for criminal organizations to introduce their profits into the financial system without scrutiny. This guilty plea should send a strong signal to MSBs to remain vigilant in their anti-money laundering duties.”
“This guilty plea holds GPOMCT responsible for failing to comply with requirements established under anti-money laundering laws,” said Special Agent in Charge Jeffrey D. Pittano of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC OIG). “The FDIC OIG is committed to working with our law enforcement partners to investigate those who fail to adhere to laws and regulations that are designed to detect and prevent financial crimes.”
Sentencing is scheduled to occur on October 15, 2021 before U.S. District Judge Janis L. Sammartino.

Texas Man Sentenced for $24 Million COVID-19 Relief Fraud Scheme,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/texas-man-sentenced-24-million-covid-19-relief-fraud-scheme,"July 28, 2021",2021,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Texas Man Sentenced for $24 Million COVID-19 Relief Fraud Scheme
A Coppell businessman was sentenced today to more than 11 years in prison for wire-fraud and money-laundering offenses in connection with his fraudulent scheme to obtain approximately $24.8 million in forgivable Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans, announced Acting U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Texas Prerak Shah and Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A Polite Jr. of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division.
Dinesh Sah, 55, of Coppell, pleaded guilty on March 24. He was sentenced today by U.S. District Judge Karen Gren Scholer, who also ordered him to pay $17,284,649.79 in restitution.
According to court documents, Sah submitted 15 fraudulent applications, filed under the names of various purported businesses that he owned or controlled, to eight different lenders seeking approximately $24.8 million in PPP loans.
He claimed that these businesses had numerous employees and hundreds of thousands of dollars in payroll expenses when, in fact, no business had employees or paid wages consistent with the amounts claimed in the PPP applications.
Sah further submitted fraudulent documentation in support of his applications, including fabricated federal tax filings and bank statements for the purported businesses, and falsely listed other persons as the authorized representatives of certain of these businesses without the authority to use their identifying information on the applications.
“Congress passed the Paycheck Protection Program to help struggling businesses stay afloat, not to fund faux entrepreneurs’ luxury lifestyles,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Prerak Shah. “Even as COVID-19 devastated companies around the nation, Mr. Sah sapped millions of dollars from the relief fund that could have helped them. He exploited the pandemic for personal gain, and we are proud to hold him accountable.”
“Today’s sentence serves as a clear reminder that individuals who exploit COVID-relief programs to enrich themselves will be held accountable under the law,” said Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Polite Jr. “The Department of Justice and its law enforcement partners remain committed to aggressively pursuing and bringing to justice those who steal federal funds intended to help legitimate small businesses.”
Based upon his false statements and fabricated documents, Sah received over $17 million in PPP loan funds and diverted the proceeds for his personal benefit, using them to purchase multiple homes in Texas, pay off the mortgages on other homes in California, and buy a fleet of luxury cars, including a Bentley convertible, Corvette Stingray, and Porsche Macan. Sah also sent millions of dollars in PPP proceeds in international money transfers. As part of his guilty plea, Sah agreed to forfeit, among other property, eight homes, six luxury vehicles, and more than $9 million in fraudulent proceeds that the government has seized to date.
“This sentencing serves as a deterrent to all who would attempt to commit fraud against any of the COVID-19 relief programs,” said Special Agent in Charge Christopher J. Altemus Jr. of the IRS – Criminal Investigation Dallas Field Office. “These programs are here to help during a pandemic, not for fraudsters like Sah to take advantage of for their own personal gain.”
The Dallas Field Offices of the FDIC-OIG, IRS-Criminal Investigation, and U.S. Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration investigated the case. Assistant Deputy Chief Anna G. Kaminska of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section and Section Chief Katherine Miller of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Texas prosecuted the case. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Erica Hilliard and Dimitri Rocha handled the asset-forfeiture component of the case.
The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act is a federal law enacted on March 29, 2020, designed to provide emergency financial assistance to the millions of Americans who are suffering the economic effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. One source of relief provided by the CARES Act was the authorization of up to $349 billion in forgivable loans to small businesses for job retention and certain other expenses, through the PPP. In April 2020, Congress authorized over $300 billion in additional PPP funding.
The PPP allows qualifying small businesses and other organizations to receive loans with a maturity of two years and an interest rate of 1%. PPP loan proceeds must be used by businesses on payroll costs, interest on mortgages, rent, and utilities. The PPP allows the interest and principal on the PPP loan to be forgiven if the business spends the loan proceeds on these expense items within a designated period of time after receiving the proceeds and uses at least a certain percentage of the PPP loan proceeds on payroll expenses.
The Fraud Section leads the Department of Justice’s prosecution of fraud schemes that exploit the CARES Act. In the months since the CARES Act was passed, Fraud Section attorneys have prosecuted more than 100 defendants in more than 70 criminal cases. The Fraud Section has also seized more than $65 million in cash proceeds derived from fraudulently obtained PPP funds, as well as numerous real-estate properties and luxury items purchased with such proceeds.

Los Angeles Man Arrested for $27 Million PPP Fraud Scheme
A California man was arrested today in Los Angeles on criminal charges related to his alleged bank fraud, false statements in a loan application and money laundering arising from the submission of fraudulent applications for Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) funds.
According to court documents, Robert Benlevi, 52, of Encino, submitted 27 bank loan applications to four banks between April and June 2020 on behalf of eight companies solely owned by Benlevi. In the applications, Benlevi allegedly sought a total of $27 million in forgivable PPP loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (SBA) under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. In his fraudulent applications, Benlevi allegedly represented that each of his companies had 100 employees and average monthly payroll of $400,000, even though he knew that the companies did not have any employees or payroll expenses. Benlevi also submitted fabricated IRS documents falsely stating that each of the companies had an annual payroll of $4,800,000.
The indictment alleges that based on Benlevi’s fraudulent loan applications, three of Benlevi’s companies — 1Stellar Health LLC, Bestways2 Health LLC, and Joyous-Health4U LLC — obtained $3 million in PPP funds. Although Benlevi falsely represented that the funds sought through the PPP loan applications would be used to pay payroll and certain other business expenses, he instead used them for personal expenses, including cash withdrawals, payments on his personal credit cards, and transfers to other personal and business accounts he controlled, the indictment alleges. In a single day, Benlevi withdrew from the Bestways2 Health account $248,000 of PPP funds in cashier’s checks, which were deposited into other accounts that Benlevi controlled.
Benlevi is charged with six counts of bank fraud, six counts of false statements in a loan application and four counts of money laundering. Each count of bank fraud and false statements in a loan application carry a maximum penalty of 30 years in federal prison, and the money laundering counts each carry a maximum penalty of 10 years. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.

Smith then directed his co-conspirators to send him portions of the PPP funds within days of receiving them and used the proceeds for personal expenses.
In addition to the prison sentence, Smith was ordered to pay $397,500 in restitution.

CALK was convicted of financial institution bribery and conspiracy to commit financial institution bribery, for corruptly using his position as the head of a federally-insured bank to issue millions of dollars in high-risk loans to Paul Manafort in exchange for a personal benefit: CALK’s placement on a 2016 presidential campaign and assistance from Manafort in trying to obtain a senior position with the incoming presidential administration.  CALK was convicted following a three-week trial before U.S. District Judge Lorna G. Schofield.
Manhattan U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said:  “A unanimous jury convicted Stephen M. Calk of approving millions of dollars in high-risk loans to Paul Manafort in an effort to secure a personal benefit, namely a high-profile spot on the presidential campaign and appointment as Secretary of the Army or another similarly high-level position in the incoming presidential administration.  Calk used the federally-insured bank he ran as his personal piggybank to try and buy himself prestige and power.  Today’s verdict sends the message that corruption at the highest levels of federally regulated financial institutions will be prosecuted by this Office.”
As reflected in the Indictment, documents previously filed in the case, and evidence introduced at trial:
CALK, The Federal Savings Bank, and Paul Manafort
STEPHEN M. CALK was the chairman and chief executive officer of The Federal Savings Bank, a federal savings association headquartered in Chicago, Illinois, with an office in New York, New York (the “Bank”).  The Bank was owned in its entirety by National Bancorp Holdings, a Chicago-based bank holding company (the “Holding Company”), and CALK was the chairman, chief executive officer, and owner of approximately 67% of the Holding Company.
Paul Manafort was a lobbyist and political consultant.  Beginning in or about March 2016, Manafort held a senior role with a 2016 presidential campaign (the “Presidential Campaign”), and from June 2016 through August 2016, he served as chairman of the Presidential Campaign.  After Manafort’s formal role with the Presidential Campaign concluded in or about August 2016, Manafort continued to be informally involved in the campaign.  Beginning in or about November 2016, when the candidate was elected President of the United States, Manafort provided informal input to the presidential transition team (the “Presidential Transition Team”).
The Corrupt Scheme
Between in or about July 2016 and January 2017, CALK engaged in a corrupt scheme to exploit his position as the head of the Bank and the Holding Company in an effort to secure a valuable personal benefit for himself, namely, Manafort’s assistance in obtaining for CALK a senior position in the presidential administration.  During this time period, Manafort sought millions of dollars in loans from the Bank.  CALK understood that Manafort urgently needed these loans in order to terminate or avoid foreclosure proceedings on multiple properties owned by Manafort and Manafort’s family.  Further, CALK believed that Manafort could use his influence with the Presidential Transition Team to assist CALK in obtaining a senior administration position.
CALK thus sought to leverage his control over the Bank and the loans sought by Manafort to his personal advantage.  Specifically, CALK offered to, and did, cause the Bank and Holding Company to extend $16 million in loans to Manafort in exchange for Manafort’s requested assistance in obtaining a high-level position in the presidential administration.  For example, and while Manafort’s loans were pending approval, CALK provided Manafort with a ranked list of the governmental positions he desired, which started with Secretary of the Treasury, and was followed by Deputy Secretary of the Treasury, Secretary of Commerce, and Secretary of Defense, as well as 19 ambassadorships similarly ranked and starting with the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Italy.
In approving these loans to Manafort, CALK was aware of significant red flags regarding Manafort’s ability to repay the loans, such as his history of defaulting on prior loans.  Moreover, given the size of the loans, Manafort’s debt became the single largest lending relationship at the Bank.  In order to enable the Bank to issue these loans without violating the Bank’s legal limit on loans to a single borrower, CALK authorized a maneuver never before performed by the Bank, in which the Holding Company—which CALK also controlled—acquired a portion of the loans from the Bank.
During the same time period, Manafort provided CALK with valuable personal benefits. First , in or about the summer of 2016, during the Presidential Campaign—and just days after CALK and the rest of the Bank’s credit committee conditionally approved a proposed $9.5 million loan to Manafort — Manafort appointed CALK to a prestigious economic advisory committee affiliated with the campaign.  And second , in or about late November and early December 2016—after the candidate had been elected President, after Manafort’s first loan from the Bank had been issued, and while a second set of loans worth $6.5 million sought by Manafort was pending approval by the Bank— Manafort used his influence with the Presidential Transition Team to assist Calk, recommending CALK for an administration position.  Due to Manafort’s efforts, CALK was formally interviewed for the position of Under Secretary of the Army on January 10, 2017 at the Presidential Transition Team’s principal offices in New York, New York.  CALK was not ultimately hired.
To conceal the unlawful nature of his scheme, CALK made false and misleading statements to the OCC regarding the loans to Manafort.  For example, CALK falsely stated to the OCC regulators that he had not known that the Manafort’s properties had been in foreclosure prior to issuing the loans.  CALK also stated that he had never desired a position in the presidential administration.
*                *                *
CALK, 56, was found guilty of one count of financial institution bribery, which carries a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison, and one count of conspiracy to commit financial institution bribery, which carries a maximum sentence of 5 years in prison.  CALK is scheduled to be sentenced on January 10, 2022.
Ms. Strauss praised the outstanding investigative work of the FBI and FDIC OIG.
This case is being handled by the Office’s Public Corruption Unit.  Assistant U.S. Attorneys Paul M. Monteleoni, Hagan Scotten, and Alexandra N. Rothman are in charge of the prosecution.

Fifth Employee in Cash Flow Partners’ Bank Fraud Conspiracy Admits Role in Multimillion-Dollar Loan Scheme
NEWARK, N.J. – A New York man today admitted participating in a scheme that involved the creation of false documentation to secure over $4 million in bank loans, Acting U.S. Attorney Rachael A. Honig announced.
Cesar Mendez, 49, of New York City, pleaded guilty by videoconference before U.S. District Judge Kevin McNulty to an information charging him with one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud.
According to documents filed in this case and statements made in court:
Between March 2016 and September 2019, Cash Flow Partners LLC, a business consulting firm with offices in New York and New Jersey, released internet advertisements and held seminars offering to assist customers in obtaining bank loans, including loans insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). When customers submitted documentation supporting their bank loan applications to Cash Flow Partners, Mendez and others created false documentation to make customers’ loan applications appear more financially viable than they actually were. Victim banks sustained losses of over $4 million.
Four of Mendez’s conspirators, Edward Espinal, Gladys Collins, Jennie Frias, and Raymundo Torres, have previously pleaded guilty to charges relating to their role in the Cash Flow bank fraud conspiracy and are awaiting sentencing.
The conspiracy to commit bank fraud charge carries a maximum potential penalty of 30 years in prison and a $1 million fine. Sentencing is scheduled for Nov. 1, 2021.

Former Branch Manager Charged With Bank Fraud
ROCHESTER, N.Y.- U.S. Attorney James P. Kennedy, Jr. announced today that Derline Cunningham, 60, of Greece, NY, was arrested and charged by criminal complaint with bank fraud and conspiracy to commit bank fraud. The charges carry a maximum penalty of 30 years in prison and a $1,000,000 fine.
Assistant U.S. Attorney John J. Field, who is handling the case, stated that from July 2014 to March 2017, the defendant was employed as a bank branch manager, initially at Bank of America and later at Citizens Bank. One of Cunningham’s largest clients was Lucian Development, including Perry Santillo, Christopher Parris, and various entities they controlled, through which they are alleged to have operated a massive, decade-long Ponzi scheme. At the behest of Lucian Development, the defendant repeatedly lied to another bank, which extended millions of dollars of revolving credit to Santillo and Parris, regarding the extent of their assets. Santillo and Parris used the credit to finance the operations of their Ponzi scheme, and but for their access to such credit, the scheme would have collapsed years earlier. The victim bank ultimately lost approximately $335,968 to Santillo and Parris.
Cunningham made an initial appearance today before U.S. Magistrate Judge Mark W. Pedersen was released.
The criminal complaint is the result of an investigation by United States Postal Inspection Service, under the direction of Acting Inspector-in-Charge Joshua W. McCallister of the Boston Division; the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Buffalo Division, under the direction of Special Agent-in-Charge Stephen Belongia, and FBI Scranton Division; the Internal Revenue Service, Criminal Investigation Division, under the direction of Thomas Fattorusso, Acting Special Agent-in-Charge; the U.S. Department of Labor, Office of Inspector General, Office of Investigations – Labor Racketeering and Fraud, under the direction of Nikitas Splagounias, Acting Special Agent-in-Charge, New York Region; the New York State Department of Financial Services, under the direction of Superintendent Linda A. Lacewell; the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of Inspector General, under the direction of Shimon Richmond, Special Agent-in-Charge Mid-Atlantic Region, and Patricia Tarasca, Special Agent-in-Charge New York Region; and the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The fact that a defendant has been charged with a crime is merely an accusation and the defendant is presumed innocent until and unless proven guilty.

Defendant Pleads Guilty to Stealing $24 Million in COVID-19 Relief Money Through Fraud Scheme that Used Synthetic Identities,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/defendant-pleads-guilty-stealing-24-million-covid-19-relief,"June 29, 2021",2021,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Defendant Pleads Guilty to Stealing $24 Million in COVID-19 Relief Money Through Fraud Scheme that Used Synthetic Identities
Miami, Fl. -- Today, Hasan Hakim Brown, 45, pled guilty in Ft. Lauderdale federal district court to working with co-conspirators to steal $24 million of COVID-19 relief money by using synthetic identities and shell companies they had created years earlier to commit other bank fraud.
Criminals manufacture synthetic identities by using the personal and financial information of real people (such as stolen social security numbers) with fraudulent, made-up information (such as fake names and dates of birth). They use the new, synthetic identities to open fraudulent bank and credit card accounts and commit other fraud.
Years before the pandemic, Brown and his co-conspirators used complex computer data storage and virtualization machines to manufacture synthetic identities, automatically open bank accounts and shell companies, and monitor bank activity tied to the synthetic (as well as stolen) identities. In 2017, they used the synthetic and stolen identities and associated bank accounts and shell companies to steal money from a bank in Texas.
Then came the COVID-19 pandemic. In March 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act was enacted. It was designed to provide emergency financial assistance to the millions of Americans suffering the economic effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. One source of relief provided by the CARES Act was the Paycheck Protection Program, which has authorized hundreds of billions of dollars in forgivable loans to small businesses to use for payroll, rent, utility, and other approved expenses.
Brown and his co-conspirators used their already-established synthetic identities and associated shell companies to fraudulently apply for financial assistance under PPP. They applied for and received $24 million dollars in PPP relief. The money was paid to companies registered to Brown and his co-conspirators, as well as to companies registered to synthetic identities that Brown and his co-conspirators controlled.
Brown pled guilty today to one count of conspiring to commit bank fraud.  Brown’s sentencing hearing is scheduled for September 9, 2021, before U.S. District Judge Singhal.  Brown faces up to 30 years in federal prison.
The following defendants have also been charged for their role in this scheme: Kevin Kirton and Jean Renald Fleuridor (20-20262-CR-Singhal), and Raul Mauricio Gonzalez (21-mj-02959-EGT). To date, law enforcement has seized approximately $11.5 million dollars in fraudulently obtained funds from members of the conspiracy, as well as Rolex, Baume & Mercier, Hubolt, and Cartier watches.

Jefferson County Engineer Sentenced for $13 Million COVID-Relief Fraud
BEAUMONT, Texas – A Beaumont engineer has been sentenced for his participation in a scheme to file two fraudulent loan applications seeking more than $13 million in forgivable Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (SBA) under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, announced Eastern District of Texas Acting U.S. Attorney Nicholas J. Ganjei today
Shashank Rai, 31, pleaded guilty on Feb. 9, 2021, to making false statements to a bank and was sentenced to 24 months in federal prison today by U.S. District Judge Marcia A. Crone.  Rai admitted that he sought millions of dollars in forgivable loans guaranteed by the SBA by claiming to have 250 employees earning wages when, in fact, no employees worked for his purported business. In the application submitted to the first lender, Rai sought $10 million in PPP loan proceeds by fraudulently claiming to have 250 employees with an average monthly payroll of $4 million. In the second application, Rai sought approximately $3 million in PPP loan proceeds by fraudulently claiming to have 250 employees with an average monthly payroll of approximately $1.2 million.
“The Payroll Protection Program was designed to provide financial support during the COVID-19 pandemic to real American businesses with real employees,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Nicholas J. Ganjei.  “It was not designed to provide loans to individuals for personal investment purposes. Today’s sentence demonstrates our shared commitment to protecting this important, taxpayer-funded program.”
The CARES Act is a federal law enacted on March 29, 2020, designed to provide emergency financial assistance to the millions of Americans who are suffering the economic effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. One source of relief provided by the CARES Act was the authorization of up to $349 billion in forgivable loans to small businesses for job retention and certain other expenses, through the PPP. In April 2020, Congress authorized over $300 billion in additional PPP funding, and in December 2020, Congress authorized another $284 billion in additional funding.
The PPP allows qualifying small businesses and other organizations to receive loans with a maturity of two years and an interest rate of 1 percent. PPP loan proceeds must be used by businesses for payroll costs, interest on mortgages, rent and utilities. The PPP allows the interest and principal to be forgiven if businesses spend the proceeds on these expenses within a set time period and use at least a certain percentage of the loan towards payroll expenses.
This case was investigated by the FHFA-OIG, FDIC-OIG, SBA-OIG, and USPIS. Assistant Chief L. Rush Atkinson and Trial Attorney Lou Manzo of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section, and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Nathaniel Kummerfeld and Frank Coan prosecuted the case.
The Fraud Section leads the department’s prosecution of fraud schemes that exploit the PPP. In the months since the PPP began, Fraud Section attorneys have prosecuted more than 100 defendants in more than 70 criminal cases. The Fraud Section has also seized more than $60 million in cash proceeds derived from fraudulently obtained PPP funds, as well as numerous real estate properties and luxury items purchased with such proceeds.

Farm equipment CEO pleads guilty in multi-million dollar bank fraud
VALDOSTA, Ga. – A Southwest Georgia businessman and owner of a tractor supply company has pleaded guilty to orchestrating a complicated fraud involving millions of dollars of loans by multiple creditors.
Rickey Carter, 60, of Nashville, Georgia, pleaded guilty to one count bank fraud on Tuesday, June 8, before U.S. District Judge Hugh Lawson. Carter faces a maximum 30 years in prison to be followed by at least five years of supervised release and a $1,000,000 fine. Sentencing is scheduled for September 15. There is no parole in the federal system.
“Rickey Carter’s decision to concoct various illegal schemes to keep his failing business afloat has damaged small businesses, community banks and defrauded the federal government. Carter’s criminal actions will ultimately land him in federal prison,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Peter D. Leary. “FBI and FDIC agents successfully unraveled Carter’s complicated fraud, preventing him from further harming small businesses and bringing him to justice.”
“Carter thought he was smart enough to swindle millions of dollars from these banks, but he wasn’t smart enough to avoid being caught and punished,” said Chris Hacker, Special Agent in Charge of FBI Atlanta. “He will be held accountable for the damage he has done, sending a strong message to anyone considering such fraud that it is a serious crime with serious consequences.”
“Rickey Carter’s guilty plea holds him responsible for his actions in fraudulently obtaining millions of dollars in loans from these banks,” said Special Agent in Charge, Kyle A. Myles of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC-OIG). “We remain committed to working with our law enforcement partners to bring to justice those who threaten the integrity of the banking system.”
Carter was the President and CEO of Nashville Tractor (NTI), a business that sold and leased agricultural and construction equipment, attachments and parts. In 2016, he obtained a United States Small Business Administration (SBA) loan with Farmers and Merchants Bank (FMB) in the principal amount of $5,000,000. At the same time, NTI obtained a new line of credit and signed a credit agreement with FMB in the amount of $625,000.
In 2010, Carter had entered into an ongoing Wholesale Financing and Security Agreement with CNH Industrial Capital America, LLC, (CNH) to finance NTI’s purchases of inventory for retail sale or lease. He also entered into a Retail Financing Agreement (RFA) with CNH under which CNH would purchase NTI’s interest in retail installment contracts for the purchase of agricultural and construction equipment with retail customers. The CNH agreement was a primary source of farm and construction equipment inventory for NTI.
Carter was able to continue operations of NTI and other loan arrangements were made with a number of other banks and financing entities. In each instance of a loan with the banks, Carter was required to provide true and complete financial information to the banks and was to provide continuing information for line of credit draws. However, during 2015, NTI began having financial and cash flow issues which made it difficult to make payments due on the loans and to make payroll. During that time, Carter began a practice of selling equipment which it held in trust but not paying the cash over to CNH and other creditors as required. Carter sold at least 88 pieces of equipment valued at more than $1.5 million subject to the security interest of CNH and sold other pieces of equipment securing financing from Kubota Credit Corporation, Ameris Bank, Bank of Alapaha and Diversified Financial Services. As part of the fraudulent scheme, Carter falsified NTI’s financial records in order to inflate the company’s net worth. As a part of falsifying records, on occasion, Carter directed NTI employees to generate payments checks on accounts payable but not send the checks, thereby reducing accounts payable but not deducting the checks from NTI’s accounts. In 2016, Carter falsified documents provided to FMB to secure the SBA loan and line of credit.
Carter also created fraudulent retail installment contracts for the sale or lease of numerous items of equipment with CNH using the names of real people whose information was available to Carter. Those fraudulent contracts generated more than $1.2 million in payments to NTI.
Carter continued through the SBA loan period to provide false and fraudulent information. In total, Carter admitted to being accountable for an intended fraud loss totaling more than $3.5 million but not more than $9.5 million. Carter is responsible for restitution for actual monetary losses caused by the fraud to FMB ($1,227,319.66), SBA ($1,500,000), Ameris Bank ($321,934.50), Bank of Alapaha ($150,000), CNH ($2,782,959.99), KCC ($185,993.32) and Diversified Financial Services ($228,399.92).
The case was investigated by the FBI and FDIC-OIG.

Pewaukee Man Sentenced for his Role in Directing COVID-19 Relief Fraud Scheme,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/pewaukee-man-sentenced-his-role-directing-covid-19-relief-fraud,"June 2, 2021",2021,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Pewaukee Man Sentenced for his Role in Directing COVID-19 Relief Fraud Scheme
Acting U.S. Attorney Richard G. Frohling of the Eastern District of Wisconsin joined Acting Assistant Attorney General Nicholas L. McQuaid of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division and other federal officials in announcing that on June 2, 2021, Thomas Smith (age 46) of Pewaukee, Wisconsin, was sentenced to 57 months’ imprisonment for fraudulently obtaining over $1 million in Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (SBA) under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. Smith will also be required to spend two years on supervised release following his prison sentence and was ordered to pay $ 960,000 in restitution.
Smith pleaded guilty to this offense on February23, 2021. According to court documents, Smith fraudulently sought over $1.2 million in PPP loans through applications to a federally insured financial institution on behalf of eight different companies. According to his plea agreement, Smith caused fraudulent loan applications to be submitted that made numerous false and misleading statements about the companies’ respective payroll expenses. Based on these representations, the financial institution approved and funded over $1 million in loans. Smith then directed his co-conspirators to send him portions of the PPP funds within days of receiving them and used the proceeds for personal expenses, he admitted.
The CARES Act is a federal law enacted on March 29, 2020, designed to provide emergency financial assistance to the millions of Americans who are suffering the economic effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. One source of relief provided by the CARES Act was the authorization of up to $349 billion in forgivable loans to small businesses for job retention and certain other expenses, through the PPP. In April 2020, Congress authorized over $300 billion in additional PPP funding, and in December 2020, Congress authorized another $284 billion in additional funding.
The PPP allows qualifying small businesses and other organizations to receive loans with a maturity of two years and an interest rate of 1%. PPP loan proceeds must be used by businesses for payroll costs, interest on mortgages, rent, and utilities. The PPP allows the interest and principal to be forgiven if businesses spend the proceeds on these expenses within a set time period and use at least a certain percentage of the loan towards payroll expenses.
The FBI, SBA-OIG, FDIC-OIG, and IRS-CI investigated the case.
Trial Attorneys Laura Connelly and Leslie S. Garthwaite of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Stephen Ingraham of the Eastern District of Wisconsin are prosecuting the case.
The Fraud Section leads the department’s prosecution of fraud schemes that exploit the PPP. In the months since the PPP began, Fraud Section attorneys have prosecuted more than 100 defendants in more than 70 criminal cases. The Fraud Section has also seized more than $65 million in cash proceeds derived from fraudulently obtained PPP funds, as well as numerous real estate properties and luxury items purchased with such proceeds.

Nine Individuals Charged for Roles in Fraud Scam Involving 200 Victims,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/nine-individuals-charged-roles-fraud-scam-involving-200-victims,"June 1, 2021",2021,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Nine Individuals Charged for Roles in Fraud Scam Involving 200 Victims
Victims Defrauded of at Least $2.5 Million
CHARLESTON, W.Va. – Three indictments returned by a federal grand jury sitting in Charleston have been unsealed that charge nine men for their involvement in illegal schemes alleged to have defrauded at least 200 victims, many of whom are elderly, of at least $2.5 million.  The nine defendants are charged with various fraud-related crimes, including mail fraud, wire fraud, money laundering and receipt of stolen property.  As of today, all nine of the defendants have been apprehended in operations executed by the United States Secret Service and other federal, state and local law enforcement agencies in seven states.
According to the indictments, from 2016 to 2020, the defendants allegedly participated in a series of romance and other online scams designed to coerce vulnerable victims into sending money to various bank accounts controlled by them.  The indictments describe romance scams as online schemes that target individuals looking for romantic partners, friendship, and other close personal and business relationships on dating websites and other social media platforms. The defendants created profiles using fictitious names, locations, and images which allowed them to cultivate relationships with the victims.  To carry out the schemes alleged in the indictments, victims were often led to believe that the defendants were U.S. residents working abroad.  However, the investigation revealed that these defendants were actually located in the United States. At the early stages of the romance scams, defendants frequently requested relatively small gifts, such as gift cards and cell phones from their victims.  As the relationships continued, they requested increasingly larger sums of money from their victims. The defendants allegedly opened bank accounts and laundered the proceeds of the romance scams through those accounts. The defendants also occasionally used cryptocurrency and celebrity meet-and-greet scams to obtain money from their victims.
“This investigation and subsequent indictments demonstrate the commitment the United States Attorney’s Office and our law enforcement partners have in aggressively pursuing those who engage in online fraud scams and prey on vulnerable members of our communities,” said Acting United States Attorney Lisa G. Johnston. “Crimes involving romance scams and other online scams are increasing at an alarming rate. This case is a reminder that users of email, texts and social media should be aware of such scams and exercise extreme caution.”
“The Secret Service is committed to protecting our nation’s financial institutions and the citizens of West Virginia,” said United States Secret Service Resident Agent in Charge Robert W. Pyle. “While this does not undo the harm that was brought upon each victim, we feel that our investigative efforts ensure that those who committed this fraud will be held accountable. We would also like to thank the West Virginia State Police, the South Charleston Police Department, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service and the FDIC-OIG for their cooperation and partnership in this case.”
The following individuals were charged in the indictments:
The United States Secret Service, the United States Postal Inspection Service, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation-Office of Inspector General (FDIC-OIG), the West Virginia State Police, the South Charleston Police Department and the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of West Virginia conducted the long-term investigation that spanned approximately two years.
The public is encouraged to report potential online fraud activity or scams at https://www.ic3.gov/ .
If you or someone you know is age 60 or older and has been a victim of financial fraud, help is standing by at the National Elder Fraud Hotline: 1-833-FRAUD-11 (1-833-372-8311).  This U.S. Department of Justice hotline, managed by the Office for Victims of Crime, is staffed by experienced professionals who provide personalized support to callers by assessing the needs of the victim, and identifying relevant next steps.  Case managers will identify appropriate reporting agencies, provide information to callers to assist them in reporting, connect callers directly with appropriate agencies, and provide resources and referrals, on a case-by-case basis.  Reporting is the first step.  Reporting can help authorities identify those who commit fraud and reporting certain financial losses due to fraud as soon as possible can increase the likelihood of recovering losses.  The hotline is staffed 10am-6pm Eastern Time, Monday-Friday. English, Spanish, and other languages are available.
The details contained in the charging documents are allegations.  The defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.

DOJ Announces Coordinated Law Enforcement Action to Combat Health Care Fraud Related to COVID-19,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/doj-announces-coordinated-law-enforcement-action-combat-health,"May 26, 2021",2021,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

DOJ Announces Coordinated Law Enforcement Action to Combat Health Care Fraud Related to COVID-19
Criminal Charges Against Telemedicine Company Executive, Physician, Marketers, and Medical Business Owners For COVID-19 Related Fraud Schemes with Losses Exceeding $143 Million
The Department of Justice today announced criminal charges against 14 defendants, including 11 newly-charged defendants and three who were charged in superseding indictments, in seven federal districts across the United States for their alleged participation in various health care fraud schemes that exploited the COVID-19 pandemic and resulted in over $143 million in false billings.
“The multiple health care fraud schemes charged today describe theft from American taxpayers through the exploitation of the national emergency,” said Deputy Attorney General Lisa O. Monaco. “These medical professionals, corporate executives, and others allegedly took advantage of the COVID-19 pandemic to line their own pockets instead of providing needed health care services during this unprecedented time in our country. We are committed to protecting the American people and the critical health care benefits programs created to assist them during this national emergency, and we are determined to hold those who exploit such programs accountable to the fullest extent of the law.”
Additionally, the Center for Program Integrity, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CPI/CMS) separately announced today that it took adverse administrative actions against over 50 medical providers for their involvement in health care fraud schemes relating to COVID-19 or abuse of CMS programs that were designed to encourage access to medical care during the pandemic.
“Medical providers have been the unsung heroes for the American public throughout the pandemic,” said FBI Director Christopher Wray. “It’s disheartening that some have abused their authorities and committed COVID-19 related fraud against trusting citizens. The FBI, along with our federal law enforcement and private sector partners, are committed to continuing to combat healthcare fraud and protect the American people.”
The defendants in the cases announced today are alleged to have engaged in various health care fraud schemes designed to exploit the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, multiple defendants offered COVID-19 tests to Medicare beneficiaries at senior living facilities, drive-through COVID-19 testing sites, and medical offices to induce the beneficiaries to provide their personal identifying information and a saliva or blood sample. The defendants are alleged to have then misused the information and samples to submit claims to Medicare for unrelated, medically unnecessary, and far more expensive laboratory tests, including cancer genetic testing, allergy testing, and respiratory pathogen panel tests. In some cases, and as alleged, the COVID-19 test results were not provided to the beneficiaries in a timely fashion or were not reliable, risking the further spread of the disease, and the genetic, allergy, and respiratory pathogen testing was medically unnecessary, and, in many cases, the results were not provided to the patients or their actual primary care doctors.  The proceeds of the fraudulent schemes were allegedly laundered through shell corporations and used to purchase exotic automobiles and luxury real estate.
“It’s clear fraudsters see the COVID-19 pandemic as a money-making opportunity — creating fraudulent schemes to victimize beneficiaries and steal from federal health care programs,” said Deputy Inspector General for Investigations Gary L. Cantrell of  Health and Human Services – Office of Inspector General (HHS-OIG). “Our agency and its law enforcement partners are aggressively and effectively investigating these egregious crimes, which is made equally clear given the results of this takedown. We will continue to support the unprecedented COVID-19 public health effort by holding accountable people who use deceptive tactics to profit from the pandemic.”
In another type of COVID-19 health care fraud scheme announced today, defendants are alleged to have exploited policies that were put in place by CMS to enable increased access to care during the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, pursuant to the COVID-19 emergency declaration, telehealth regulations and rules were broadened so that Medicare beneficiaries could receive a wider range of services from their doctors without having to travel to a medical facility. The cases announced today include first in the nation charges for allegedly exploiting these expanded policies by submitting false and fraudulent claims to Medicare for sham telemedicine encounters that did not occur. As part of these cases, medical professionals are alleged to have offered and paid bribes in exchange for the medical professionals’ referral of medically unnecessary testing.
The law enforcement action today also includes the third set of criminal charges related to the misuse of Provider Relief Fund monies. The Provider Relief Fund is part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, a federal law enacted March 2020 designed to provide needed medical care to Americans suffering from COVID-19.
The Fraud Section is prosecuting the cases in the following districts: Western District of Arkansas, Northern District of California, Middle District of Louisiana, Central District of California, Southern District of Florida, District of New Jersey, and the Eastern District of New York.
Today’s enforcement actions were led and coordinated by Assistant Chief Jacob Foster and Trial Attorneys Rebecca Yuan and Gary A. Winters of the National Rapid Response Strike Force of the Health Care Fraud Unit of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section, in conjunction with the Health Care Fraud Unit’s Medicare Fraud Strike Forces (MFSF) in Miami, Los Angeles, the Gulf Coast, and Brooklyn, as well as the U.S. Attorneys’ Offices for the Northern District of California, Western District of Arkansas, and Middle District of Louisiana.
The MFSF is a partnership among the Criminal Division, U.S. Attorneys’ Offices, the FBI and HHS-OIG. In addition, U.S. Postal Inspection Service, Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation, Veterans Affairs Office of Inspector General, Department of Defense Office of Inspector General, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Louisiana Medicaid Fraud Control Unit, and other federal and state law enforcement agencies participated in the law enforcement action.
The law enforcement action was brought in coordination with the Health Care Fraud Unit’s COVID-19 Interagency Working Group, which is chaired by the National Rapid Response Strike Force and organizes efforts to address illegal activity involving health care programs during the pandemic.
The Fraud Section leads the Medicare Fraud Strike Force. Since its inception in March 2007, the Medicare Fraud Strike Force, which maintains 15 strike forces operating in 24 federal districts, has charged more than 4,200 defendants who have collectively billed the Medicare program for nearly $19 billion. In addition, the HHS Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, working in conjunction with the HHS-OIG, are taking steps to increase accountability and decrease the presence of fraudulent providers.

Former Managing Director and Two Former Loan Officers Plead Guilty for Roles in Widespread Bank-Fraud Scheme,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/former-managing-director-and-two-former-loan-officers-plead,"May 20, 2021",2021,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Former Managing Director and Two Former Loan Officers Plead Guilty for Roles in Widespread Bank-Fraud Scheme
The former managing director of residential lending and two former loan officers of a financial institution headquartered in Southfield, Michigan, pleaded guilty to participating in a years-long scheme to originate fraudulent residential-mortgage loans through the bank’s low-documentation Advantage Loan Program.
According to court documents and statements made in court, YiHou Han, 39, of San Francisco, California, Hao Liang “Frank” Hu, 48, of Chino Hills, California, and Amy Lu, 33, of Brea, California, each caused the submission of fraudulent loan applications to the financial institution, referred to as Financial Institution A, under the Advantage Loan Program, which resulted in the origination of loans. Han served as a senior loan officer, and eventually as the managing director of residential lending, at Financial Institution A, while Hu and Lu served as residential-loan officers. At various times during the conspiracy that ran from 2011 until 2019, Han, Hu, and Lu falsified and caused to be falsified borrowers’ income and debt-to-income ratios, job titles, employment histories, and supporting documents, among other things. As part of the scheme, they instructed borrowers to fabricate deposit histories and to transfer funds to third parties, who would then transfer the funds back to the borrowers as “gifts” in order to conceal the true source of the funds and to promote the underlying fraud scheme. Han, Hu, and Lu also knowingly facilitated the approval of loans to borrowers involved in money laundering and tax evasion.
As part of her guilty plea, Han admitted that she and her co-conspirators undermined Financial Institution A’s ability to implement effective anti-money laundering controls to monitor, investigate, and report potentially suspicious activity involving Advantage Loan Program borrowers. Han further admitted that her falsification of documents and material information about borrowers’ qualifications for the Advantage Loan Program was done with the knowledge and encouragement of members of Financial Institution A’s senior management in order to increase the volume of loans originated under the Advantage Loan Program, which in turn increased the bank’s revenue and the co-conspirators’ personal commissions.
During the conspiracy, Han originated at least 1,288 Advantage Loans, Hu originated at least 825 Advantage Loans, and Lu originated at least 358 Advantage Loans, representing a total of at least 2,471 loans and more than $876 million in credit extend by Financial Institution A. Han, Hu, and Lu admitted that the overwhelming majority of these loans were based on one or more fraudulent actions and that primarily as a result of the origination of these fraudulent loans Han earned approximately $3,381,355.26 in commissions, Hu earned approximately $2,519,488.98 in commissions, and Lu earned approximately $990,847.58 in commissions.
Han pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud and wire fraud, while Lu previously pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud and wire fraud, and Hu previously pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud and wire fraud. Han is scheduled to be sentenced on Aug. 18, 2021, while Lu and Hu are scheduled to be sentenced on June 28, 2021, and June 27, 2022, respectively. Lu faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison, and Hu and Han each face a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.
Acting Assistant Attorney General Nicholas L. McQuaid of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division; Assistant Director in Charge Kristi K. Johnson of the FBI’s Los Angeles Field Office; Inspector in Charge Delany De Léon-Colón of the Criminal Investigation Group of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS); Acting Special Agent in Charge Francis Mace of the Office of Inspector General for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC-OIG), San Francisco Region; and Special Agent in Charge Scott K.

Two Camden County Residents Charged with Conspiracy to Defraud Victims of More Than $1.4 Million in Coronavirus Relief Fraud Scheme
CAMDEN, N.J. – Two Camden County, New Jersey, residents were charged for their role in fraudulently obtaining federal Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans and Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL) totaling $1.4 million, Acting U.S. Attorney Rachael A. Honig announced today.
Stephen Bennett, 45, of Berlin, New Jersey, and Rhonda Thomas, 36, of Sicklerville, New Jersey, are each charged by complaint with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and bank fraud, one count of bank fraud, and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. Bennett and Thomas are scheduled to appear by videoconference today before U.S. Magistrate Judge Karen M. Williams.
According to the criminal complaints:
The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act is a federal law enacted in March 2020, designed to provide emergency financial assistance to the millions of Americans who are suffering the economic effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. One source of relief provided by the CARES Act was the authorization of up to $349 billion in forgivable loans to small businesses for job retention and certain other expenses, through the PPP.
The PPP allows qualifying small businesses and other organizations to receive loans, which must be used by businesses on payroll costs, interest on mortgages, rent, and utilities. The PPP allows the interest and principal on the PPP loan to be forgiven if the business spends the loan proceeds on these expense items within a designated period and uses at least a certain percentage of the PPP loan proceeds on payroll expenses.
The CARES Act authorized the Small Business Administration (SBA) to provide EIDLs of up to $2 million to eligible small businesses experiencing substantial financial disruption due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A company may use EIDL funds for payroll expenses, sick leave, production costs, and business obligations, such as debts, rent, and mortgage payments.
To obtain a PPP loan or EIDL, a qualifying business must apply and provide information on its operations, such as the number of employees, gross revenues, and cost of goods sold. Supporting documentation may also be required.
Bennett, Thomas, and their conspirators submitted 15 fraudulent PPP loan applications and six fraudulent EIDL loan applications to several lenders and the SBA on behalf of 12 purported businesses. The applications contained fraudulent representations to the participating lenders, including forged documentation of federal tax returns and altered bank statements.  According to Social Security Administration records, there were no wages or Forms W-2 processed for any of the businesses between 2018 and 2020.
Based on these alleged misrepresentations, the lenders approved 13 of the PPP and EIDL applications and provided the businesses with approximately $1.4 million in federal COVID-19 emergency relief funds meant for distressed small businesses. Bennett and Thomas used the proceeds to purchase personal items, including vehicles and jewelry.
The counts of bank fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud and bank fraud are each punishable by a maximum of 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine, or twice the gross gain or loss from the offense, whichever is greater. The count of conspiracy to commit money laundering is punishable by a maximum of 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine, or twice the gross gain or loss from the offense, whichever is greater.
Acting U.S. Attorney Honig credited special agents of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation – Office of the Inspector General, New York Regional Office, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Patricia Tarasca; special agents of the Social Security Administration, Office of the Inspector General, New York Field Division, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge John F. Grasso; special agents of the FBI’s South Jersey Resident Agency, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Michael J. Driscoll in Philadelphia, special agents of the U.S. Department of Labor, Office of the Inspector General, New York Region, under the direction of Acting Special Agent in Charge Nikitas Splagounias, and inspectors of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, under the direction of Inspector in Charge Damon Wood in Philadelphia, with the investigation leading to today’s charges. She also thanked the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry, under the direction of Acting Secretary Jennifer Berrier, for its assistance.
The government is represented by Senior Trial Counsel Jason M. Richardson and Assistant U.S. Attorney Daniel A. Friedman of the U.S. Attorney’s Office’s Criminal Division in Camden.
The charges and allegations contained in the complaint are merely accusations, and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.

Owner of Wedding Planning Company Pleads Guilty to COVID-19 Relief Fraud
PLANO, Texas – A Murphy, Texas, man, pleaded guilty today to filing fraudulent loan applications seeking more than $3 million in forgivable Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (SBA) under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.
According to court documents, Fahad Shah, 44, admitted that he sought over $3 million in PPP loans from two different SBA-approved lenders. In the first application submitted to one lender, Shah sought over $1.7 million in PPP loan proceeds by fraudulently claiming that his company, WBF Weddings by Farah Inc. (WBF), employed 126 individuals with an average monthly payroll of over $700,000. In the second application, Shah sought over $1.5 million in PPP loan proceeds by fraudulently claiming that WBF had 126 employees with an average monthly payroll of over $600,000. According to court documents, WBF had only two employees. In connection with both PPP loan applications, Shah submitted fraudulent Employer’s Quarterly Federal Tax Return (IRS Form 941) documents for 2019.
“PPP loans were intended to help businesses keep themselves and their employees afloat during the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Nicholas J. Ganjei.  “PPP loans were not, and never were, intended to serve as personal loans for personal use.  By applying and qualifying for PPP funds on fraudulent grounds, Fahad Shah took advantage of the COVID-19 economic crisis to enrich himself and his family.  By seeking a loan that he should not have received, Shah helped to deplete the amount of funds available to all potential legitimate borrowers who really needed financial support.  This plea shows that the Eastern District of Texas is dedicated to pursuing fraudsters and ensuring they do not benefit from their crimes.”
Shah admitted that he obtained over $1.5 million in PPP loan proceeds. Within days of receiving the PPP funds, Shah used over $1 million in fraudulently obtained proceeds to pay off his home mortgage, purchase securities through his personal investment account, and buy two Teslas, two Freightliner trucks, and a Mercedes Benz van.
Shah was indicted by a federal grand jury on June 18, 2020, and pleaded guilty to wire fraud today. Under federal statutes, Shah faces up to 20 years in federal prison. The maximum statutory sentence prescribed by Congress is provided here for information purposes, as the sentencing will be determined by the court based on the advisory sentencing guidelines and other statutory factors. A sentencing hearing will be scheduled after the completion of a presentence investigation by the U.S. Probation Office.
Acting U.S. Attorney Nicholas Ganjei of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Texas; Acting Assistant Attorney General Nicholas L. McQuaid of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division; Special Agent in Charge Amaleka McCall-Brathwaite of the U.S. Small Business Administration – Office of Inspector General (SBA-OIG); Special Agent in Charge Catherine Huber of the Federal Housing Finance Agency – Office of Inspector General (FHFA-OIG); Inspector General Jay N. Lerner of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation – Office of Inspector General (FDIC-OIG); Acting Special Agent in Charge Mark Pearson of the IRS Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI) Dallas Field Office; and Inspector General J. Russell George of the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) made the announcement.
The SBA-OIG, FHFA-OIG, FDIC-OIG, IRS-CI, and TIGTA are investigating the case.
Assistant U.S. Attorneys Frank Coan and Robert Wells of the Eastern District of Texas and Trial Attorneys Della Sentilles and Louis Manzo of the Justice Department’s Fraud Section are prosecuting the case.
The CARES Act is a federal law enacted on March 29, 2020, designed to provide emergency financial assistance to the millions of Americans who are suffering the economic effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. One source of relief provided by the CARES Act was the authorization of up to $349 billion in forgivable loans to small businesses for job retention and certain other expenses, through the PPP. In April 2020, Congress authorized over $300 billion in additional PPP funding.
The PPP allows qualifying small businesses and other organizations to receive loans with a maturity of two years and an interest rate of 1%.  PPP loan proceeds must be used by businesses on payroll costs, interest on mortgages, rent, and utilities. The PPP allows the interest and principal to be forgiven if businesses spend the proceeds on these expenses within a set time period and use at least a certain percentage of the loan towards payroll expenses.
The Fraud Section leads the Department of Justice’s prosecution of fraud schemes that exploit the CARES Act. In the months since the CARES Act was passed, Fraud Section attorneys have prosecuted more than 100 defendants in more than 70 criminal cases. The Fraud Section has also seized more than $65 million in cash proceeds derived from fraudulently obtained PPP funds, as well as numerous real-estate properties and luxury items purchased with such proceeds.

Two North Bay Brothers Plead Guilty To Separate But Similar Pandemic Relief Fraud Schemes Netting Over $2 Million
Brothers Obtained COVID-19 Relief Funds By Creating Numerous Fake Businesses Along With Fraudulent Incorporation And Tax Documents
SAN FRANCISCO – Caesar Oskan, also known as Sezer Ozkan, and his brother Ester Ozkar, also known as Eser Ozkay, pleaded guilty today in federal court to making false statements to a financial institution in separate schemes to defraud the federal government of  pandemic relief funds, announced Acting United States Attorney Stephanie M. Hinds; Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation Acting Special Agent in Charge Michael Daniels; United States Secret Service Special Agent in Charge of San Francisco Field Office James Anderson; Federal Bureau of Investigation Special Agent in Charge Craig D. Fair; Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration J. Russell George; Small Business Administration Office of Inspector General, Western Region Special Agent in Charge Weston King; and Office of Inspector General for the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, Western Region Special Agent in Charge Scott Redington.
Both Caesar Oskan, 66, of San Rafael, and Ester Ozkar, 66, of Novato, admitted as part of their guilty pleas that between March 2020 and June 2020 they each submitted multiple separate fraudulent applications for Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL) and Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans in a scheme to defraud the Small Business Administration and the banks handling the PPP loans.  EIDL and PPP are loan programs designed to help businesses survive during the Covid-19 pandemic.
In his written plea agreement, Caesar Oskan admitted that he obtained $1,006,004 in fraudulent PPP loans and $713,500 in fraudulent EIDL loans and advances.  In Ester Ozkar’s plea agreement, he admitted that he obtained $474,132 in fraudulent PPP loans and $9,000 in EIDL advances.
“Pandemic relief funds are limited and intended to save legitimate struggling businesses from failing,” said Acting United States Attorney Stephanie M. Hinds. “Individuals, like these two brothers, who treat these pools of relief funds as their personal bank accounts deserve to be vigorously prosecuted.”
“Honest and law abiding citizens are fed up with the likes of those who use deceit and fraud to line their pockets with money intended to help businesses affected by the pandemic,” said Michael Daniels, Acting Special Agent in Charge IRS Criminal Investigation. “Those individuals who engage in this type of financial fraud should know they will not go undetected and will be held accountable.”
“The U.S. Secret Service is dedicated to investigating those who prey on businesses by taking advantage of pandemic relief funds,” said United States Secret Service Special Agent in Charge of the San Francisco Field Office James Anderson. “This investigation exemplifies the success we can achieve when the Secret Service and our law enforcement partners work together to protect America’s financial infrastructure.”
“The FBI and our partners are actively working to identify individuals, like the Oskan brothers, who are taking advantage of COVID relief programs intended to support hardworking Americans and small businesses struggling with financial challenges due to the pandemic,” said FBI Special Agent in Charge Craig D. Fair.  “We will continue to collaborate across agency lines to combat this type of fraud and ensure these crucial funds are used as intended – not to enrich those who exploit the system for their own greed.”
“The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration will aggressively pursue those who endeavor to defraud taxpayer-funded Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act programs, which were established to provide assistance to American business owners during these unprecedented times,” said J. Russell George, Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration.  “We appreciate the efforts of the U.S. Department Justice and our law enforcement partners in this effort.”
“Lying to gain access to economic stimulus funds will be met with justice,” said Small Business Administration Office of Inspector General, Western Region Special Agent in Charge Weston King. “SBA OIG will relentlessly pursue evidence of fraud against SBA’s programs aimed at assisting the nation’s small businesses struggling with pandemic challenges.  I want to thank the U.S. Attorney’s Office for its leadership and dedication to pursuing justice.”
“The defendants admitted to defrauding the federal government of pandemic relief funds and are now convicted felons,” said Scott Redington, Special Agent in Charge, Western Region, Office of Inspector General for the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection. “We are fully committed to bringing to justice wrongdoers who exploit and defraud financial institutions and the government’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic.”
The admissions of the two defendants in their respective written plea agreements describe the breadth of their criminal schemes.  In Caesar Oskan’s plea agreement, he admitted that he submitted 27 fraudulent applications for PPP and EIDL loans.  The applications were submitted on behalf of several entities with names such as “Bake and Wrap LLC”, “Comfort Plus Transportation LLC”, “Fast Food Plus LLC”, “Healthy Comfort Food”, and “CTC Trade LLC”.  Oskan admitted that for many of his applications he registered the fictitious entities with the California Secretary of State, then backdated the Secretary of State documents to reflect earlier creation dates for the entities so that the entity could qualify for a pandemic relief loan.  For each of his 27 applications, Oskan created fake IRS tax documents that contained false statements about the number of employees, false payroll costs, and false wage amounts paid.
In an example from his plea agreement, Oskan admitted applying on June 1, 2020, in the name of “CTC Trade LLC” to a bank for a PPP loan in the amount of $268,719.  He had registered CTC Trade LLC as a business with the California Secretary of State less than a month before, on May 6, 2020.  However, in his application Oskan represented that CTC Trade LLC was created prior to February 15, 2020 (the creation cutoff date for PPP and EIDL loan qualification), employed 17 employees, and had an average monthly payroll of $107,468.  Oskan admitted in his plea agreement that each of these representations was false.  He further admitted submitting fraudulent Articles of Incorporation and a fraudulent IRS form with the application.  The application succeeded, and the bank disbursed $268,719 to him.
Separately, Ester Ozkar admitted in his plea agreement that he submitted eight fraudulent  applications for PPP and EIDL loans on behalf of six entities with names such as “7Transportations”, “Alya LLC”, “Century Transportations Inc”, and “Last Mile Shuttle”.  Ozkar admitted that  Alya LLC was a fictitious entity that he registered with the California Secretary of State and then modified the Secretary of State documents to reflect a creation date earlier than February 15, 2020, so that the entity would qualify for PPP and EIDL loans.  He further admitted that for every application, he created and submitted fake IRS tax documents containing false statements about the entity’s number of employees, payroll costs, and wages paid to fictitious employees.
In an example from his plea agreement, Ozkar states that he applied on or about April 7, 2020, on behalf of “Blockchain Tech, LLC” to a bank for a PPP loan in the amount of $46,250.  He admitted he represented in the application that Blockchain Tech, LLC was in operation prior to February 15, 2020, employed four employees, and averaged a monthly payroll of $18,500.  Ozkar further admitted that each of these representations was false.  He also admitted that he submitted multiple fraudulent IRS forms in the application.  The application succeeded, and the bank disbursed $46,250 to him.
Caesar Oskan and Ester Ozkar each pleaded guilty to one count of making a false statement to a financial institution, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1014.  Each defendant faces a maximum penalty of 30 years in prison and a one million dollar fine.  However, any sentence imposed by the court will follow only after the court’s consideration of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and the federal statute governing the imposition of a sentence, 18 U.S.C. § 3553.
United States District Judge Charles R. Breyer set a sentencing hearing for each defendant on December 15, 2021, at 10 a.m.  The defendants remain out of custody on bond.
For background information, the PPP is administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.  The CARES Act is a federal law enacted in March 2020 to provide emergency financial assistance to the millions of Americans suffering from the economic effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.  PPP loan proceeds must be used by the business on certain permissible business expenses, including payroll costs, interest on mortgages, rent, and utilities. The PPP allows the interest and principal on a PPP loan to be entirely forgiven if the business spends the loan proceeds on these business expense items within a designated period of time and uses at least 60% of the PPP loan proceeds on payroll expenses.  Loans made through the PPP are 100% guaranteed by the SBA.
Similarly, the EIDL Program provides low-interest non-forgivable loans and fully forgivable advances to small businesses, among others, in regions affected by disasters.  In March 2020 EIDL funds were made available to all states and territories due to the magnitude and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Maya Karwande is the Assistant U.S. Attorney who is prosecuting the case with the assistance of Ralph Banchstubbs.  The prosecution is the result of an investigation by the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation; the United States Secret Service; the Federal Bureau of Investigation; the U.S. Department of the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration; the Office of Inspector General for the Small Business Administration; and the Office of Inspector General for the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection.

Guilty Plea in First-In-The-Nation Cares Act Fraud Case,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/guilty-plea-first-nation-cares-act-fraud-case,"May 17, 2021",2021,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

PROVIDENCE - A Massachusetts man who faked suicide shortly after he and a co-defendant became the first in the nation to be charged with fraudulently seeking hundreds of thousands of dollars in forgivable pandemic relief small business loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (SBA) under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, pleaded guilty today to conspiring to commit bank fraud and failure to appear in court.
The CARES Act Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) allowed qualifying small businesses to receive forgivable or low interest loans to meet payroll costs and mortgage, rent, and utility payments.
David Adler Staveley, a/k/a Kurt David Sanborn, a/k/a David Sanborn, 54, of Andover, MA, admitted he conspired with David Andrew Butziger, 53, of Warwick, RI, to file four fraudulent PPP loan applications with a Rhode Island bank, falsely claiming they owned businesses with large monthly payrolls when, in fact, they did not own the businesses. Staveley admitted that he and Sanborn filed fraudulent loan applications seeking $185,570 to pay employees at Top of the Bay restaurant in Warwick, RI; $144,050 at Remington House Inn restaurant in Warwick, RI; $108, 777 at On The Trax restaurant in Berlin, MA; and $105,381 for employees at Dock Wireless, an unincorporated business.
Remington House Inn and On The Trax were closed at the time the loan applications were submitted, and remain closed; Staveley has no ownership interest in Top of the Bay; and Dock Wireless had no employees and no wages were ever paid by the business.
In May 2020, Staveley and Butziger became the first individuals in the nation charged with defrauding the CARES Act Paycheck Protection Program. Three weeks after appearing in federal court and being released to home detention with electronic monitoring, Staveley removed his electronic monitoring device and fled. Staveley staged his suicide by, among other things, leaving suicide notes with associates and in his car, which was located by the ocean in Massachusetts, unlocked and with his wallet inside. Law enforcement determined that between May 26 and July 23, 2020, Staveley, who was to have appeared in federal court on June 2, 2020, traveled to various states using false identities and stolen license plates. He was apprehended by the United States Marshals Service in Alpharetta, GA., on July 23, 2020.
Appearing today before U.S. District Court Judge Mary S. McElroy, Staveley pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit bank fraud and failure to appear in court as required, announced Acting United States Attorney Richard B. Myrus. Staveley is scheduled to be sentenced on August 2, 2021.
Butziger pleaded guilty on September 18, 2020, to conspiracy to commit bank fraud. He is scheduled to be sentenced on June 23, 2021.
The cases are being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Lee H. Vilker.
The matter was investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation.
The Justice Department acknowledges and thanks the SBA Office of Inspector General and the FDIC, Office of Inspector General for their assistance in the investigation.

Two Individuals Charged for their Roles in Massive Cattle Ponzi Scheme,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/two-individuals-charged-their-roles-massive-cattle-ponzi-scheme,"May 12, 2021",2021,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Wednesday, May 12, 2021
A federal grand jury in Colorado returned an indictment that was unsealed Tuesday charging an Illinois woman and a Georgia man with running a Ponzi scheme that raised approximately $650 million from investors across the country.
According to court documents, Reva Joyce Stachniw, 69, of Galesburg, Illinois, and Ron Throgmartin, 57, of Buford, Georgia, were charged with running a Ponzi scheme, along with a third co-conspirator, Mark Ray, from late 2017 until early 2019. Ray was previously charged by criminal information for his role in the Ponzi scheme in the Central District of Illinois in February 2020.
According to the indictment, Stachniw, Throgmartin, and other co-conspirators solicited hundreds of millions of dollars from victim-investors throughout the United States. Most often, the conspirators fraudulently represented to victim-investors that their investments were backed by short-term investments in cattle. They also used false and fraudulent pretenses to solicit money from victim-investors for the conspirators’ Colorado-based marijuana business, Universal Herbs LLC. Other victim-investors gave the conspirators money based on false promises that investment money would be used for legitimate business activity related to cattle or marijuana, without having the investment money linked to specific investment opportunities.
In all three variations of the conspirators’ investment fraud scheme, victim-investors were promised returns of approximately 10% to 20% over periods as short as several weeks. At no point did Stachniw, Throgmartin, or Ray tell victim-investors that they were primarily using their money to repay other investors in a Ponzi-style investment scheme, or to enrich themselves. Stachniw and Throgmartin allegedly received millions of dollars from the scheme, despite putting little to none of their own money into it.
Stachniw and Throgmartin are each charged with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and bank fraud, five counts of wire fraud, and one count of conspiracy to engage in money transactions in property derived from specified unlawful activity. Stachniw and Throgmartin made their initial court appearance Tuesday before U.S. Magistrate Judge N. Reid Neureiter of the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado. If convicted, Stachniw and Throgmartin face a maximum penalty of 30 years in prison and a $1 million fine for conspiracy to commit wire fraud and bank fraud, 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine for wire fraud, and 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine for conspiracy to engage in money transactions in property derived from specified unlawful activity. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.
Acting Assistant Attorney General Nicholas L. McQuaid of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division; Special Agent in Charge John Crawford of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC-OIG) Chicago Regional Office; and Special Agent in Charge Christopher Combs of the FBI’s San Antonio Field Office made the announcement.
The FDIC-OIG and the FBI are investigating the case.
Trial Attorney Michael P. McCarthy of the Justice Department’s Fraud Section is prosecuting the case.
An indictment is merely an allegation and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.

A Florida man was sentenced today to more than six years in prison for fraudulently obtaining approximately $3.9 million in Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans and using those funds, in part, to purchase a $318,000 Lamborghini luxury car for himself.
David T. Hines, 29, of Miami, pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud on Feb. 10 . According to court documents, Hines submitted multiple PPP applications to a PPP-participating lender, claiming to have had dozens of employees and millions of dollars in monthly payroll. In addition to submitting false and fraudulent IRS forms to support the applications, Hines also assisted other individuals in obtaining fraudulent PPP loans. As part of the sentence, the court ordered Hines to forfeit the $3.4 million in fraudulent loan proceeds that law enforcement seized and the 2020 Lamborghini Huracan that Hines purchased for approximately $318,000.

Hatcher of the IRS Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI) Miami Office; and Acting Special Agent in Charge Stephen Donnelly of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection OIG, Eastern Region, made the announcement.
The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act is a federal law enacted on March 29, 2020, designed to provide emergency financial assistance to the millions of Americans who are suffering the economic effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. One source of relief provided by the CARES Act was the authorization of up to $349 billion in forgivable loans to small businesses for job retention and certain other expenses, through the PPP. In April 2020, Congress authorized over $300 billion in additional PPP funding, and in December 2020, Congress authorized another $284 billion in additional funding.
The PPP allows qualifying small businesses and other organizations to receive loans with a maturity of two years and an interest rate of 1%. Businesses must use PPP loan proceeds for payroll costs, interest on mortgages, rent and utilities. The PPP allows the interest and principal to be forgiven if businesses spend the proceeds on these expenses within a set time period and use at least a certain percentage of the loan towards payroll expenses.

The Fraud Section leads the department’s prosecution of fraud schemes that exploit the PPP. In the months since the CARES Act passed, Fraud Section attorneys have prosecuted more than 100 defendants in more than 70 criminal cases. The Fraud Section has also seized more than $60 million in cash proceeds derived from fraudulently obtained PPP funds, as well as numerous real estate properties and luxury items purchased with such proceeds.

Former President of First Mortgage Company Pleads Guilty to Bank Fraud, Money Laundering, and False Statements to a Financial Institution
OKLAHOMA CITY – Yesterday, RONALD J. MCCORD, 70, of Oklahoma City, pleaded guilty to defrauding two locally-based banks, Fannie Mae, and others through a broad range of fraudulent conduct over the course of three years, announced Acting U.S. Attorney Robert J. Troester.
McCord was the Chairman and founder of First Mortgage Company, LLC (""FMC""), an Oklahoma City-based mortgage lending and loan servicing company.  On June 3, 2020, a grand jury returned a 24-count Indictment against McCord.  The charges included bank fraud, money laundering, and making a false statement to a financial institution.
Yesterday, McCord pleaded guilty to five counts of the Indictment.
According to court documents and yesterday’s plea hearing, McCord admitted to defrauding Spirit Bank (""Spirit"") and Citizens State Bank (""Citizens"")—two state-chartered financial institutions—as well as their respective residential mortgage subsidiaries, American Southwest Mortgage Corporation (""Mortgage Corp."") and American Southwest Mortgage Funding Corporation (""Funding Corp."").  An independent audit discovered that McCord had sold more than $14,100,000.00 in Spirit/Mortgage Corp. and Citizens/Funding Corp. loans ""out of trust"" by failing to repay Spirit/Mortgage Corp. when certain Spirit/Mortgage Corp.-initiated loans were refinanced or otherwise paid off.  At the time of this discovery, FMC carried outstanding balances of about $200,000,000.00 and $140,000,000.00 on the Spirit/Mortgage Corp. and Citizens/Funding Corp. lines of credit, respectively.
Upon learning of McCord’s conduct, Spirit/Mortgage Corp. and Citizens/Funding Corp. terminated future warehouse lending to FMC, and instituted new notification requirements that required McCord to assign FMC-funded mortgages to Spirit/Mortgage Corp. and Citizens/Funding Corp., to ensure the title companies handling those mortgages sent payoffs directly to the banks.  McCord admitted at yesterday’s plea hearing that he filed the assignments as required, but then caused the mortgages to be released on two properties—in Leland and Denver, North Carolina—after collecting the mortgage payoffs.
Spirit/Mortgage Corp. and Citizens/Funding Corp.’s refusal to fund new FMC mortgages prompted McCord to seek out a new warehouse lender.  In early 2017, McCord began negotiating with CapLOC, LLC, a North Carolina-based mortgage lending business, and offered to sell FMC’s mortgage lending business in exchange for quick funding from CapLOC.  At yesterday’s plea hearing, McCord admitted that he made a materially false statement and representation to CapLOC in the course of those negotiations, in order to influence CapLOC’s actions.
Finally, in 2017, FMC serviced approximately 12,000 loans worth a total of approximately $1,800,000,000.00 for the Federal National Mortgage Association (""Fannie Mae"").  McCord admitted at the plea hearing that he defrauded Fannie Mae by diverting escrow monies intended to pay homeowners’ taxes and insurance premiums to cover FMC’s operating expenses.  McCord also admitted that he then laundered the proceeds by causing a wire transfer from FMC’s operating account to a custom home builder, as payment towards construction of McCord’s home in Colorado.
At sentencing, which is currently scheduled for August 9, 2021, McCord faces up to 30 years in prison and a fine of up to $1,000,000.00 on each count of bank fraud and false statement to a financial institution.  He also faces up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000.00 fine on the money laundering count.  Per the terms of his plea agreement, the government agreed not to advocate at sentencing for a sentence above 104 months.  Under the plea agreement, McCord will be ordered to pay restitution to the victims of his conduct in amounts to be determined by the court at the time of sentencing.  McCord must also forfeit proceeds of the fraudulent schemes and property involved in the offenses.  Further, as part of the plea agreement, the government will dismiss at sentencing the remaining counts of the Indictment.
This case is the result of investigations by the Federal Housing Finance Agency Office of the Inspector General, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  Assistant U.S. Attorney Julia E. Barry is prosecuting the case.
Reference is made to court filings for further information.

New York City Man Charged with Nearly $4 Million COVID-19 Relief Fraud Scheme and Money Laundering,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/new-york-city-man-charged-nearly-4-million-covid-19-relief-fraud,"May 6, 2021",2021,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Thursday, May 6, 2021
A criminal complaint was filed in the District of New Jersey today charging a dual-resident of New York and Florida with fraudulently obtaining and laundering nearly $4 million in funds from the COVID-19 relief Paycheck Protection Program (PPP).
According to court documents, Gregory J. Blotnick, 34, of New York City and West Palm Beach, used a variety of false representations to fraudulently obtain more than $3.8 million in federal COVID-19 PPP funds. To obtain the loan money, Blotnick submitted eight falsified loan applications to numerous lenders on behalf of five of Blotnick’s businesses, including his New York City-based hedge fund management firm, Brattle Street Capital LLC and related entities. To obtain the PPP loans, Blotnick submitted false information, including the number of his employees, federal tax returns for his businesses, and his payroll documentation, and he certified that he would use the loan money only for business-related purposes. After fraudulently obtaining the loans, Blotnick laundered and misused the loan proceeds by, among other things, transferring those proceeds to brokerage accounts and placing more than $3 million in losing stock trades.
“Not only did Blotnick fraudulently obtain almost $4 million in relief funds reserved for those suffering serious financial harm from the tragic COVID-19 pandemic, he also lied about how he would use those funds, placing millions of dollars in losing stock trades,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Nicholas L. McQuaid of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. “The Justice Department and its law enforcement partners remain committed to aggressively pursuing and holding accountable fraudsters who treat COVID-19 relief programs like a personal piggy bank.”
“The funds made available through the Paycheck Protection Program are intended to help businesses and their workers get through the financial hardships caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, not to enrich the unscrupulous few who, like this defendant, lie to obtain those funds for their own personal profit,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Rachael A. Honig for the District of New Jersey. “We will continue to protect the viability of important federal programs like these by working quickly to identify, investigate, and prosecute the individuals who see a time of national crisis as an opportunity to commit fraud.”
“As the federal government moves to support small businesses during this critical time, members of the Federal Home Loan Bank system play an integral role in the Paycheck Protection Program,” said Special Agent in Charge Robert Manchak of the Northeast Region of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, Office of Inspector General (FHFA-OIG). “The charges announced today serve as a reminder that those who mislead lenders and seek to defraud the CARES Act will be held accountable. We are proud to work with the Department of Justice and our federal law enforcement partners during this unprecedented crisis.”
“These charges demonstrate our commitment to hold accountable those who attempt to defraud pandemic-related assistance programs designed to aid businesses and employees in these challenging times,” said Special Agent in Charge John F. Grasso of the Social Security Administration OIG (SSA-OIG) New York Field Division. “We will continue to collaborate across agency lines to combat this self-serving type of fraud. I want to thank the Federal Housing Finance Authority OIG, IRS Criminal Investigation, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation OIG, and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for their efforts to bring this individual to justice.”
“These charges reflect greed and a selfish attempt to increase personal wealth on the backs of Americans suffering from the ongoing pandemic,” said Special Agent in Charge Patricia Tarasca of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation OIG (FDIC-OIG) New York Region. “As with this case, we will continue to vigorously investigate financial crimes and we appreciate the cooperation of our fellow law enforcement partners.”
Blotnick is charged with eight counts of wire fraud and six counts of money laundering. The defendant is scheduled for his initial court appearance on May 20. If convicted, he faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison for each count of wire fraud, and a maximum of 10 years in prison for each count of money laundering. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.
The FHFA-OIG, IRS-CI, SSA-OIG and the FDIC-OIG are investigating the case.
Trial Attorney Cory E. Jacobs of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Fatime Meka Cano of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of New Jersey are prosecuting the case.

New Jersey Man Sentenced to More Than Five Years in Federal Prison for $3.5 Million Bank Fraud Scheme,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/new-jersey-man-sentenced-more-five-years-federal-prison-35,"April 29, 2021",2021,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Thursday, April 29, 2021
Baltimore, Maryland – U.S. District Judge Deborah K. Chasanow today sentenced Mehul Khatiwala, age 37, of Voorhees, New Jersey, to 63 months in federal prison, followed by four years of supervised release, for conspiracy to commit bank fraud and for three counts of bank fraud, in connection with schemes to fraudulently obtain a total of approximately $15 million in loans from Cecil Bank to purchase hotels and a multifamily residential property, resulting in losses of more than $3.5 million.  Judge Chasanow also ordered Khatiwala to pay a $50,000 fine and to forfeit and pay restitution of $3,593,801.
The sentence was announced by Acting United States Attorney for the District of Maryland Jonathan F. Lenzner; Special Agent in Charge Robert Manchak of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), Office of Inspector General; Special Agent in Charge Shimon R. Richmond of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation-Office of Inspector General(FDIC-OIG); Special Inspector General Christy Goldsmith Romero of the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (SIGTARP); and Inspector General Hannibal “Mike” Ware of the Small Business Administration - Office of Inspector General.
“Mehul Khatiwala will now serve more than five years in federal prison for fraudulently obtaining more than $15 million in loans.  Khatiwala’s criminal behavior stole millions of dollars from the victims, which included not only the bank that made the loans, but the American taxpayers whose tax dollars guaranteed the loans,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Jonathan F. Lenzner.  “All of us in federal law enforcement are committed to investigating and prosecuting this type of costly fraud.”
According to his plea agreement, from February 2011 through January 2014, Khatiwala and two co-conspirators executed a scheme to defraud Cecil Bank, the Small Business Administration (SBA), and other financial institutions by misrepresenting material facts in order to obtain financing for the purchase of two hotels and a multifamily residential property.  Khatiwala defaulted on the loans, causing losses to Cecil Bank and the SBA of more than $3.5 million.  According to the indictment and information presented at today’s plea hearing, on December 23, 2008, Cecil Bank’s holding company, Cecil Bankcorp, Inc., received an $11.5 million bailout from the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP).
Specifically, beginning in approximately April 2011, Khatiwala and Conspirator A made plans to apply for a $5 million loan at Cecil Bank to purchase the Memphis Airport Hotel in Memphis, Tennessee, as well as a $1.6 million loan to renovate that hotel.  In order to obtain a loan, Khatiwala concealed Conspirator A’s 80% ownership of the borrowing entity because Conspirator A had already reached his legal lending limit at Cecil Bank.  In May 2011, Cecil Bank’s Board of Directors approved the $5 million loan, with the condition that it be guaranteed by the SBA.  The SBA required Khatiwala, as the purported 100% owner of the borrowing entity, to show that he had equity in the borrowing entity, or cash on hand of approximately $1.8 million.  Conspirator B, who was an employee at another bank, falsely verified that Khatiwala had over $2 million on deposit at the co-conspirator’s bank.  Khatiwala admitted that he signed and submitted this statement, which he knew to be false.  The SBA approved its 75% guarantee of the $5 million loan funded by Cecil Bank.  The loan went into default in January 2015.
In 2007, Khatiwala and the other owners of the Best Western Hotel in York, Pennsylvania, refinanced a loan for the property in the amount of $6.635 million.  In early 2010, Khatiwala and his co-owners became delinquent on the loan and began discussions with the loan servicing company.  In August 2011, Khatiwala reached an agreement with the loan servicer to accept a discounted payoff of $3.625 million on the unpaid principal balance of approximately $6.6 million.  Khatiwala submitted fraudulent documentation and a fraudulent settlement statement to the loan servicer showing that the funds were being provided by a private lender.  In fact, Khatiwala had arranged for the sale of the hotel to related parties for the sum of $4.3 million.
As early as April 2011, prior to the time Khatiwala made the misrepresentations to the loan servicer to negotiate the payoff, he began implementing the second step of his short-sale fraud scheme by arranging the sale of the hotel to Person B and one of Khatiwala’s employees.  Khatiwala fraudulently obtained a $3.225 million loan from Cecil Bank, which was guaranteed by the SBA. During the loan application review and underwriting process performed by Cecil Bank and the SBA, Khatiwala submitted false documents as to the ownership of the selling and purchasing entities, as well as false financial statements for the purchasers.  Khatiwala knew that the funds paid at closing would come from Khatiwala’s own personal bank account and other businesses, not from the purchasers, as was falsely represented to the bank and the SBA, in order to obtain approval of the loan.  As a result of this short-sale fraud, the original holder of the note on the Best Western Hotel lost $675,000, which instead went to Khatiwala.
Finally, Khatiwala admitted that beginning in February 2011, he negotiated the purchase of a multifamily residential property in Perryville, Maryland.  In order to obtain the loan, he established a company to serve as the borrowing and purchasing entity, representing to Cecil Bank that Persons A and B, a husband and wife, were the 100% owners of the company, and Khatiwala was the manager.  In fact, Conspirator A owned 50% of the company and agreed to serve as guarantor on the loan.  The bank approved a $7,122,500 loan for the purchase of the property with Persons A and B as the 100% owners of the purchasing entity.  On about March 28, 2011, several days before settlement, Khatiwala e-mailed to Conspirator A an Amended and Restated Operating Agreement reflecting Conspirator A’s 50% interest in the property and his agreement to indemnify Persons A and B for any loss, cost, liability or expense arising in connection with any enforcement of Cecil Bank’s rights under the loan guarantee agreement.  Khatiwala, Conspirator A, and Persons A and B signed the Amended Agreement; however, that material fact and document were never disclosed to Cecil Bank before or after the settlement, thus concealing Conspirator A’s ownership interest in the property.  As early as February 2012, the loan payments of approximately $29,000 per month became delinquent and the loan went into default.  Cecil Bank ultimately sold the note to a private lender for $3.252 million in lieu of foreclosure, incurring a loss of $3,583.170.
Acting United States Attorney Jonathan F. Lenzner commended the FHFA, the FDIC-OIG, SIGTARP, and the SBA-OIG, for their work in the investigation.  Mr. Lenzner thanked Assistant U.S. Attorneys Martin J. Clarke and Harry M. Gruber, who prosecuted the case.

Chicago Attorney Charged With False Statement and Tax Offenses in Connection With Funds Received From Failed Chicago Bank,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/chicago-attorney-charged-false-statement-and-tax-offenses,"April 29, 2021",2021,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Chicago Attorney Charged With False Statement and Tax Offenses in Connection With Funds Received From Failed Chicago Bank
CHICAGO — A Chicago attorney was indicted today on false statement and tax charges in connection with funds he received from Washington Federal Bank for Savings.
PATRICK D. THOMPSON, 51, is charged with five counts of willfully filing a false income tax return and two counts of knowingly making a false statement to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., according to an indictment returned in U.S. District in Chicago.  Arraignment has not yet been scheduled.
The indictment was announced by John R. Lausch, Jr., United States Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois; Jay N. Lerner, Inspector General of the FDIC’s Office of Inspector General; Tamera Cantu, Acting Special Agent-in-Charge of IRS Criminal Investigation in Chicago; Emmerson Buie, Jr., Special Agent-in-Charge of the Chicago Field Office of the FBI; Catherine Huber, Special Agent-in-Charge of the Central Region of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, Office of Inspector General; Sally Luttrell, Assistant Inspector for Investigations of the Department of the Treasury, Office of Inspector General; Joseph M. Ferguson, City of Chicago Inspector General; and Kathryn B. Richards, Chicago Housing Authority Inspector General.  The government is represented by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Brian Netols, Michelle Petersen, Jeremy Daniel, and Nicholas Eichenseer.
According to the charges, Thompson from 2011 to 2014 received $219,000 from Chicago-based Washington Federal via a purported loan and other unsecured payments.  He made one re-payment on the loan but then stopped making payments, and he failed to pay interest on the funds he received, the indictment states.  Washington Federal was shut down in 2017 after the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency determined it was insolvent and had at least $66 million in nonperforming loans.  When the FDIC, as successor in interest to Washington Federal, attempted to obtain repayment from Thompson in 2018, he falsely stated that he owed only $110,000 and that those funds were for home improvement, when Thompson knew he had actually received $219,000 and that $110,000 of it was paid by the bank to a law firm as Thompson’s capital contribution, the indictment states.
The tax charges accuse Thompson of falsely representing on five years of income taxes that he paid interest on money he received from Washington Federal, even though he knew he did not pay interest in the amounts reported on the returns.
Ten other defendants, including several high-ranking former bank employees, were previously charged as part of the ongoing federal criminal investigation into the failure of Washington Federal.
The public is reminded that an indictment is not evidence of guilt.  The defendant is presumed innocent and entitled to a fair trial at which the government has the burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  Each false statement count is punishable by a maximum sentence of 30 years in federal prison, while each tax count is punishable by up to three years.  If convicted, the Court must impose a reasonable sentence under federal statutes and the advisory U.S. Sentencing Guidelines.

Dodge County Strip Club Owner & Former Manager Charged with Federal Offenses
Acting United States Attorney Richard G. Frohling announced that on April 27, 2021, a federal grand jury in the Eastern District of Wisconsin indicted Radomir Buzdum (61), formerly of Watertown, Wisconsin, and Timothy J.

The indictment contains three counts.  Count One alleges that between July 2012 and January 2019, Buzdum (the owner of the club) and Miller (a former manager) conspired with each other and others to use facilities in interstate commerce to promote, manage, and carry on unlawful prostitution offenses, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Sections 371 & 1952(a)(3).  According to the indictment, the purpose of the conspiracy was to generate revenue by making areas of the club for unlawful prostitution activity, including oral sex, full intercourse, and fetish activities.  The indictment further alleges that members of the conspiracy hired and employed dancers willing to perform sex acts, including women they knew were working for pimps, and allowed customers to use credit cards to pay for private rooms and to obtain cash back to pay dancers directly for sex acts.
Counts Two and Three allege that Buzdum made and subscribed materially false tax returns for Tequila Nights, Inc. (TNI) for tax years 2015 and 2016.  According to the indictment, Buzdum was the sole shareholder of TNI, through which he operated both TNT and the Dew Drop Inn, a tavern located in Watertown.  The indictment alleges that for each year, Buzdum willfully underreported gross receipts and business income from his strip club and his tavern.
If convicted of Count One, Buzdum and Miller each would face up to five years in prison.  If convicted of Count Two or Count Three, Buzdum would face up to three years in prison per count of conviction.  All three counts also carry a maximum fine of $250,000 and a maximum term of three years of supervised release following any prison sentence.
This case was investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Internal Revenue Service – Criminal Investigation, Dodge County Sheriff’s Office, Racine Police Department, United States Department of Labor – Office of Inspector General, Hartford Police Department, and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation – Office of Inspector General, with the assistance of the Wisconsin Department of Justice –Division of Criminal Investigation, Watertown Police Department, Milwaukee Police Department and United States Department of Homeland Security – Homeland Security Investigations.
The case is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Erica J. Lounsberry and Acting U.S. Attorney Richard G. Frohling.

Manhattan Man Arrested For $5.8 Million Scheme To Defraud Loan Program Intended To Help Small Businesses During COVID-19 Pandemic
Audrey Strauss, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, William F. Sweeney Jr., Assistant Director-in-Charge of the New York Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”), Amaleka McCall-Brathwaite, Special Agent-in-Charge of the Eastern Region Office of the Inspector General of the U.S. Small Business Administration (“SBA-OIG”), and Jonathan D. Larsen, Special Agent in Charge of the New York Field Office of the Internal Revenue Service, Criminal Investigation (“IRS-CI”), and Patricia Tarasca, Special Agent in Charge of the New York Region Office of the Inspector General of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC-OIG”), announced today the unsealing of a criminal complaint charging MARCUS FRAZIER with major fraud against the United States, bank fraud, wire fraud, making false statements, and money laundering, for carrying out a fraudulent scheme to obtain $5.8 million in government-guaranteed loans designed to provide relief to small businesses during the novel coronavirus/COVID-19 pandemic.  FRAZIER was arrested this morning and presented before United States Magistrate Judge Gabriel W. Gorenstein this afternoon.
U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said:  “As alleged, Marcus Frazier sought millions of dollars in unsecured SBA-guaranteed loans for which his businesses did not qualify.  Frazier allegedly did this by lying about the number of people employed by his businesses, the salaries they were paid, even that these employees existed.  Further, Frazier allegedly used the loan proceeds he did obtain not to pay allowable expenses, but rather, to fund his lavish lifestyle.  Now Marcus Frazier stands to learn the true cost of his alleged conduct.”
FBI Assistant Director William F. Sweeney Jr. said:  “As alleged, Frazier fraudulently sought approximately $5.8 million in PPP loans through a government program designed to help small businesses continue to pay their employees during the pandemic.  Rather than use the proceeds he ultimately secured for this purpose, he used the funds for personal expenses that included luxury hotels and travel.  With today’s action, the only place he’ll travel is the courthouse in Lower Manhattan to face justice and the possibility of a lengthy stay in federal prison.”
SBA-OIG Special Agent-in-Charge Amaleka McCall-Brathwaite said:  “Lying to gain access to economic stimulus funds will be met with justice.  Greed has no place in SBA’s programs that are intended to provide assistance to the nation’s small businesses struggling with the pandemic challenges.  I want to thank the U.S. Attorney’s Office and our law enforcement partners for their dedication and pursuit of justice.”
IRS-CI Special Agent-in-Charge Jonathan D. Larsen said:  “Instead of using these vital CARES Act funds to keep his purported businesses afloat, the defendant allegedly drowned himself in luxuries. I applaud the speed with which the federal law enforcement community uncovered these alleged abuses. The arrest today should be an unequivocal message about the consequences that await those engaged in related alleged criminal activities.”
FDIC-OIG Special Agent-in-Charge Patricia Tarasca said:  “These charges represent blatant falsehoods, fraud, and other criminal conduct that sought to take advantage of tax dollars meant to help the nation recover from the ongoing pandemic.  We appreciate the work of our law enforcement partners on this important case.”
According to the allegations in the Complaint[1] unsealed today in Manhattan federal court:
The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act is a federal law enacted on March 29, 2020, designed to provide emergency financial assistance to the millions of Americans who are suffering the economic effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.  One source of relief provided by the CARES Act was the authorization of up to $349 billion in forgivable loans to small businesses for job retention and certain other business expenses through the Paycheck Protection Program (the “PPP”).  The PPP allows qualifying small businesses and other organizations to receive unsecured SBA-guaranteed loans.  PPP loan proceeds must be used by businesses on payroll costs, mortgage interest, rent, and/or utilities, among other specified expenses.  Pursuant to the CARES Act, the amount of PPP funds a business is eligible to receive is determined by the number of employees employed by the business and their average payroll costs.  Businesses applying for a PPP loan must provide documentation to confirm that they have in the past paid employees the compensation represented in the loan application.
Between in or about May 2020 and in or about April 2021, FRAZIER submitted at least seven applications for PPP loans for various businesses he controlled (collectively, the “Frazier Companies”).  These applications relied upon fraudulent statements regarding the number of employees of each business and the amount of payroll involved in each business and were submitted, in many cases, alongside fake bank statements, designed to support FRAZIER’s false statements.  These fake bake statements included, among other things, fraudulent account statements for a checking account that showed balances far greater than the account actually held, and depicted payroll withdrawals that never occurred.  FRAZIER also submitted lists of employees on the purported payrolls of the Frazier Companies, which included names and Social Security numbers that do not match the records of the Social Security Administration, suggesting that FRAZIER fabricated the employee records.  On at least one occasion, FRAZIER also provided documents purporting to show that one of the Frazier Companies had been in existence for approximately 10 years.  In truth and in fact, however, the corporate entity had not been registered until on or about July 2020, months after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.
FRAZIER sought more than approximately $5.8 million in PPP loans and was awarded at least approximately $2.17 million.  A substantial portion of the funds awarded were spent not on payroll for the Frazier Companies but, rather, on FRAZIER’s personal expenses.  During the period between on or about June 18, 2020, shortly after his first PPP loan was funded, and on or about April 7, 2021, FRAZIER utilized PPP funds to spend approximately $124,982 on hotels, including more than approximately $88,791 at a luxury hotel located in Miami, Florida.  During the same period, FRAZIER spent approximately $63,000 on restaurants and food service, approximately $17,000 on transportation with Uber, approximately $16,519 on airline travel, and approximately $11,000 on clothing.  During this same period, FRAZIER collected approximately $21,000 in unemployment benefits.
*                *                *
FRAZIER, 47, of New York, New York York, is charged in the Complaint with (1) major fraud against the United States, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1031, which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison; (2) bank fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1349, which carries a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison ; (3) wire fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1343, which carries a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison; (4) making false statements to a bank, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1014, which carries a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison; (5) making false statements, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1001, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison; (6) making false statements to the SBA, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 645, which carries a maximum sentence of two years in prison and (7) money laundering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1957, which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison.  The maximum potential sentences in this case are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendant would be determined by the judge.
Ms. Strauss praised the outstanding investigative work of the FBI, SBA-OIG, IRS-CI, and FDIC-OIG in this case.
The case is being prosecuted by the Office’s Complex Frauds and Cybercrime Unit.  Assistant U.S. Attorney Katherine Reilly is in charge of the prosecution.
The charges contained in the Complaint are merely accusations, and the defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.

[1] As the introductory phase signifies, the entirety of the text of the Complaint, and the description of the Complaint set forth herein, constitute only allegations, and every fact described should be treated as an allegation.

California Man Charged with COVID-Relief Fraud Scheme
A federal grand jury in Los Angeles, California, returned an indictment on April 13, charging a California man with stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars from the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP).
According to court documents, Oumar Sissoko, 59, of Temecula, submitted a PPP loan application on behalf of his company, Road Doctor California LLC, that sought and obtained $7.25 million. The loan application certified that the funds would be used to retain workers and maintain payroll or make mortgage-interest payments, lease payments, and utility payments. Between on or about May 1 to May 12, 2020, Sissoko misappropriated hundreds of thousands of dollars of the PPP loan proceeds to use for impermissible purposes, including the purchase of a luxury car for more than $100,000, the satisfaction of a loan made to Sissoko in connection with his prior acquisition of a different luxury car, and the purchase of a computer for almost $6,000. Sissoko also attempted to transmit approximately $150,000 to accounts in Mauritania associated with a different company for which Sissoko purports to serve as CEO.
Sissoko is charged with four counts of wire fraud. The defendant is scheduled for his initial court appearance at a later date in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. If convicted, he faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison for each count. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.
Acting Assistant Attorney General Nicholas L. McQuaid of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division; Acting U.S. Attorney Tracy L. Wilkison of the Central District of California; Assistant Director in Charge Kristi K. Johnson of the FBI’s Los Angeles Field Office; Special Agent in Charge Weston King of the U.S. Small Business Administration’s Office of Inspector General’s (SBA-OIG) Western Region; and Special Agent in Charge Wade V. Walters of the San Francisco Regional Office of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s Office of Inspector General (FDIC-OIG) made the announcement.
The FBI, SBA-OIG and FDIC-OIG are investigating the case.
Trial Attorney John “Fritz” Scanlon of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Alexander C.K. Wyman of the Central District of California are prosecuting the case.
The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act is a federal law enacted on March 29, 2020, designed to provide emergency financial assistance to the millions of Americans who are suffering the economic effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. One source of relief provided by the CARES Act was the authorization of up to $349 billion in forgivable loans to small businesses for job retention and certain other expenses, through the PPP. In April 2020, Congress authorized over $300 billion in additional PPP funding.
The PPP allows qualifying small businesses and other organizations to receive loans with a maturity of two years and an interest rate of 1%. PPP loan proceeds must be used by businesses on payroll costs, interest on mortgages, rent, and utilities. The PPP allows the interest and principal on the PPP loan to be forgiven if the business spends the loan proceeds on these expense items within a designated period of time after receiving the proceeds and uses at least a certain percentage of the PPP loan proceeds on payroll expenses.
The Fraud Section leads the Department of Justice’s prosecution of fraud schemes that exploit the CARES Act. In the months since the CARES Act was passed, Fraud Section attorneys have prosecuted more than 100 defendants in more than 70 criminal cases. The Fraud Section has also seized more than $65 million in cash proceeds derived from fraudulently obtained PPP funds, as well as numerous real-estate properties and luxury items purchased with such proceeds.

Cedar Rapids Man Sentenced to Federal Prison for Fraud Charges
DAVENPORT, Iowa — On Monday, April 19, 2021, United States District Court Judge Stephanie M. Rose sentenced Christopher Michael Goerdt, age 40, of Cedar Rapids, to 69 months in prison for Bank Fraud, Aggravated Identity Theft, Wire Fraud, and Misapplication by Bank Officer announced Acting United States Attorney Richard D. Westphal. Goerdt was ordered to serve five years of supervised release to follow his prison term and pay $1,500 to the Crime Victims’ Fund. Furthermore, Goerdt was ordered to pay $1,124,343.60 in restitution to the victims of his crimes. The victims include County Bank, Peoples Trust and Savings Bank, Farm Bureau Financial Services, and Everest Insurance.
This investigation began as early as 2006 when Goerdt participated in fraudulent activities at multiple financial institutions. Goerdt obtained and used a credit card in the name of a bank for his personal use. Further, Goerdt falsified loan documents, diverted loan proceeds, altered appraisals, made false statements to investigators, and obtained loans without the knowledge of customers. The Court found the loss attributable to Goerdt for the 15 counts he pleaded to was nearly $900,000. Furthermore, Goerdt knew he was being investigated by law enforcement and continued his pattern of deception by seeking employment that would allow him to commit additional fraud at Farm Bureau Financial Services.
This matter was investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of Inspector General (FDIC OIG). This case was prosecuted by the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Iowa.

Middlesex Man Admits Paycheck Protection Program Fraud Scheme and Obtaining Funds from a Deposited Stolen and Altered U.S. Treasury Check,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/middlesex-man-admits-paycheck-protection-program-fraud-scheme,"April 21, 2021",2021,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Middlesex Man Admits Paycheck Protection Program Fraud Scheme and Obtaining Funds from a Deposited Stolen and Altered U.S. Treasury Check
TRENTON, N.J. – A Middlesex County, New Jersey, man today admitted fraudulently receiving Payment Protection Program (PPP) funds and depositing a stolen and altered U.S. Treasury check, Acting U.S. Attorney Rachael A. Honig announced today.
Bernard Lopez, 40, pleaded guilty by videoconference before U.S. District Judge Peter G. Sheridan to an information charging him with one count each of bank fraud and theft of government funds.
According to the documents filed in this case and statements made in court:
Lopez devised a scheme to commit bank fraud through which a stolen and altered U.S. Treasury check was deposited into a corporate bank account Lopez created in the name of Pezlo Management LLC. The check was altered to be made payable to Pezlo in the amount of $211,886 and was then deposited into Pezlo’s corporate bank account. Lopez later withdrew or transferred the stolen proceeds from Pezlo’s bank account before the bank could detect the fraud.
On June 24, 2020, Lopez caused to be submitted a fraudulent PPP loan application to a lender on behalf of Company-1, a purported business that Lopez controlled. The Small Business Administration oversees the PPP, which is designed to provide forgivable loans to small businesses affected by the coronavirus pandemic. Applicants for PPP loans apply directly to banks or financial institutions participating in the program; in those applications, applicants make affirmative certifications about their average monthly payroll expenses and number of employees. Applicants also certify their intent to spend PPP proceeds on permissible business expenses, such as payroll costs, rent, utilities, and interest on mortgages. PPP loans may be entirely forgiven if the recipient spends the loan proceeds on these permissible expenses within a designated period after receiving the proceeds.
Lopez’s PPP application falsely represented that Company-1 employed 25 employees, had a monthly payroll expense of approximately $192,000, and had mortgage/lease and utilities expenses. Company-1 did not, in fact, employ any employees, nor did it incur payroll or utility expenses. Based on Lopez’s misrepresentations, the lender approved Lopez’s PPP loan application and provided Lopez’s purported business with $481,502 in federal COVID-19 emergency relief funds meant for distressed small businesses. Lopez then converted a portion of the proceeds for his own use.
The count of bank fraud is punishable by a maximum penalty of 30 years in prison and a $1 million fine, or twice the gross gain to the defendant or gross loss to the victim, whichever is greater. The count of theft of government funds is punishable by a maximum of 10 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000, or twice the gross gain or loss from the offense, whichever is greater. Sentencing is scheduled for Oct. 6, 2021.
Acting U.S. Attorney Honig credited special agents and task force officers of the U.S. Department of the Treasury-OIG, under the direction of Assistant Inspector General for Investigations Sally D. Luttrell, with the investigation leading to the charges.

Cameroon Man Sentenced to Four Years in Prison for Defrauding Bourbonnais Bank, Others
PEORIA, Ill. –A citizen of Cameroon, Lovette Namatinga, 34, has been sentenced to serve 48 months in federal prison for defrauding a Bourbonnais, Ill., bank of nearly $300,000. At the sentencing hearing, on April 13, 2021, Senior U.S. District Judge Michael M. Mihm further ordered that Namatinga pay restitution in the amount of $278,201 to the bank and numerous other individual and business victims of the defendant’s fraud scheme.
Namatinga, of Owings Mills, Md., has remained in the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service since he was arrested on Oct. 7, 2019, at Washington Dulles International Airport by FDIC Office of Inspector General agents.
On Sept. 21, 2020, immediately prior to jury selection before his trial, Namatinga pleaded guilty to all counts of the indictment, four counts each of bank and wire fraud, as charged, related to his  defrauding Municipal Trust and Savings Bank, Bourbonnais, Ill. Namatinga admitted that he carried out the fraud from about February to April 2019, by falsely representing to the bank that the secretary of one of the bank’s customers requested that cashier’s checks be sent to Namatinga’s fraudulent company known as Keiko San Products Alimenticious, LLC. Namatinga is the registered agent for Keiko, and the four checks were mailed to his home address. Once the checks were deposited into Keiko bank accounts, Namatinga then transferred money from those accounts to his personal account or withdrew cash from those accounts.
In addition to the fraud committed through Municipal Trust & Savings Bank, Namatinga used his fraudulent business and multiple associated bank accounts to deposit and launder fraud proceeds from various other victims throughout the United States. Namatinga’s scheme, known as a business e-mail compromise scam, was just one such scheme in 2019 that resulted in more than 23,000 victims nationally, with an average loss of $75,000 per complaint, according to FBI crime statistics.
The FDIC Office of Inspector General conducted the case investigation. Assistant U.S. Attorney Eugene L. Miller represented the government in the prosecution.

Wisconsin Man Pleads Guilty to COVID-Relief Fraud,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/wisconsin-man-pleads-guilty-covid-relief-fraud,"April 12, 2021",2021,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Wisconsin Man Pleads Guilty to COVID-Relief Fraud
Acting U.S. Attorney Richard G. Frohling of the Eastern District of Wisconsin joined Acting Assistant Attorney General Nicholas L. McQuaid of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division and other federal officials in announcing that on April 12, 2021, a Wisconsin man pleaded guilty for his role in fraudulently obtaining over $600,000 in Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (SBA) under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.
According to court documents, Stephen Smith, 42, of Milwaukee, admitted that he fraudulently sought over $600,000 in PPP loans through applications to an insured financial institution on behalf of three different companies. According to his plea agreement, Smith caused fraudulent loan applications to be submitted that made numerous false and misleading statements about the companies’ respective payroll expenses. Smith then directed his co-conspirators to send him portions of the PPP funds within days of receiving them and used the proceeds for personal expenses.
Smith pleaded guilty to bank fraud. He is scheduled to be sentenced on Wednesday, July 14, 2021 and faces a maximum penalty of 30 years in prison. United States District Judge Brett Ludwig will determine Smith’s sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.
The SBA-OIG, FBI, FDIC-OIG, and IRS-CI are investigating the case.
Trial Attorneys Laura Connelly and Leslie S. Garthwaite of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Stephen Ingraham of the Eastern District of Wisconsin are prosecuting the case.
The CARES Act is a federal law enacted on March 29, 2020, designed to provide emergency financial assistance to the millions of Americans who are suffering the economic effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. One source of relief provided by the CARES Act was the authorization of up to $349 billion in forgivable loans to small businesses for job retention and certain other expenses, through the PPP. In April 2020, Congress authorized over $300 billion in additional PPP funding, and in December 2020, Congress authorized another $284 billion in additional funding.
The PPP allows qualifying small businesses and other organizations to receive loans with a maturity of two years and an interest rate of 1%. PPP loan proceeds must be used by businesses for payroll costs, interest on mortgages, rent, and utilities. The PPP allows the interest and principal to be forgiven if businesses spend the proceeds on these expenses within a set time period and use at least a certain percentage of the loan towards payroll expenses.
The Fraud Section leads the department’s prosecution of fraud schemes that exploit the PPP. In the months since the PPP began, Fraud Section attorneys have prosecuted more than 100 defendants in more than 70 criminal cases. The Fraud Section has also seized more than $60 million in cash proceeds derived from fraudulently obtained PPP funds, as well as numerous real estate properties and luxury items purchased with such proceeds. More information can be found at: https://www.justice.gov/criminal-fraud/ppp-fraud .

Torrance Man and His Sister Charged in Multimillion Dollar Real Estate Scam Involving Fake Open Houses at Not-for-Sale Homes,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/torrance-man-and-his-sister-charged-multimillion-dollar-real,"April 6, 2021",2021,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Torrance Man and His Sister Charged in Multimillion Dollar Real Estate Scam Involving Fake Open Houses at Not-for-Sale Homes
LOS ANGELES – A Southern California brother-and-sister team were arrested today on federal charges alleging they orchestrated a $6 million real estate fraud scam in which they listed homes without the owners’ consent and collected money from multiple would-be buyers for each of the not-for-sale homes.
Adolfo Schoneke, 43, of Torrance, and his sister, Bianca Gonzalez, a.k.a. Blanca Schoneke, 38, of Walnut, each pleaded not guilty this afternoon to nine charges contained in an indictment unsealed after their arrests. The indictment charges Schoneke and Gonzalez with one count of conspiracy, seven counts of wire fraud, and one count of aggravated identity theft.
According to the indictment, Schoneke and Gonzalez, with the help of co-conspirators, operated real estate and escrow companies based in Cerritos, La Palma and Long Beach under a variety of names, including MCR and West Coast. The indictment alleges Schoneke and Gonzalez found properties that they would list for sale – even though many, in fact, were not for sale, and they did not have authority to list them for sale – and they then marketed the properties as short sales providing opportunities for purchases at below-market prices.
Using other people’s broker’s licenses, Schoneke and Gonzalez allegedly listed the properties on real estate websites such as the Multiple Listing Service (MLS). In some cases, the indictment alleges, the homes were marketed through open houses that co-conspirators were able to host after tricking homeowners into allowing their homes to be used.
As part of the alleged scheme, the co-conspirators accepted multiple offers for each of the not-for-sale properties, hiding this fact from the victims and instead leading each of the victims to believe that his or her offer was the only one accepted. The co-conspirators allegedly were able to string along the victims – sometimes for years – by telling them closings were being delayed because lenders needed to approve the purported short sales.
The indictment also alleges that Schoneke and Gonzalez directed office workers to open bank accounts in the office workers’ names. Those accounts were used to receive down payments on the homes and other payments from victims who were convinced to transfer the full “purchase price” to these bank accounts after receiving forged short sale approval letters. Schoneke and Gonzalez also allegedly directed the office workers to withdraw large amounts of cash from these accounts and give it to them – a procedure that allowed Schoneke and Gonzalez to take possession of the fraud proceeds while hiding their involvement in the scheme.
Investigators estimate that several hundred victims collectively lost more than $6 million during the scheme.
During the arraignments this afternoon, a trial was scheduled for June 1. Both defendants will remain in custody at least until detention hearings scheduled for Friday for Schoneke and April 13 for Gonzalez.
An indictment contains allegations that a defendant has committed a crime. Every defendant is presumed innocent until and unless proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
If convicted of all charges, Schoneke and Gonzalez each would face a statutory maximum sentence of 162 years in federal prison.
This matter was investigated by the FBI and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of Inspector General. The investigation was initiated by numerous complaints to the Long Beach Police Department and the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department, both of which provided substantial assistance during the federal investigation.
This case is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Kerry L. Quinn of the Major Frauds Section.

Maryland Man Facing Federal Charge for Fraudulently Obtaining a $1.5 Million Paycheck Protection Program Loan and Attempting to Obtain at Least Two Additional Fraudulent Covid-19 Relief Loans,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/maryland-man-facing-federal-charge-fraudulently-obtaining-15,"April 5, 2021",2021,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Maryland Man Facing Federal Charge for Fraudulently Obtaining a $1.5 Million Paycheck Protection Program Loan and Attempting to Obtain at Least Two Additional Fraudulent Covid-19 Relief Loans
Law Enforcement Also Obtained Warrants to Seize $2.2 Million and a 2018 Tesla Model 3
Greenbelt, Maryland – A criminal complaint has been filed charging Rudolph Brooks, Jr., age 45, of Cheltenham, Maryland, on the federal charge of wire fraud.  In addition, law enforcement obtained warrants authorizing the seizure of more than $2.2 million held in various bank accounts, as well as a 2018 Tesla Model 3.  The criminal complaint was filed on March 29, 2021 and was unsealed following Brooks’s arrest on April 2, 2021.
The criminal complaint and seizures were announced by Acting United States Attorney for the District of Maryland Jonathan F. Lenzner; Special Agent in Charge Shimon R. Richmond of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of Inspector General (FDIC OIG); Acting Special Agent in Charge Darrell Waldon of the Internal Revenue Service - Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI), Washington, D.C. Field Office; Special Agent in Charge Jennifer C. Boone of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Baltimore Field Office; and Inspector General Hannibal “Mike” Ware of the U.S. Small Business Administration Office of Inspector General (SBA OIG).
As detailed in the affidavit filed in support of the criminal complaint, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act is a federal law enacted in March 2020 to provide emergency financial assistance to the millions of Americans suffering from the economic consequences of COVID-19.  The CARES Act authorized up to $659 billion in forgivable loans to small businesses for employee retention and certain business expenses through the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”).  The business must use PPP loan proceeds on payroll costs, mortgage interest, rent, and utilities.  Initially, the program allowed the principal to be forgiven if the business spent the loan proceeds on qualifying expenses within eight weeks of loan issuance and used at least 75 percent of the loan for payroll.  On June 5, 2020, the Paycheck Protection Program Flexibility Act of 2020 went into effect.  This law extended the period from eight weeks to 24 weeks that the loan proceeds had to be spent and reduced the requirement that the loan proceeds be spent on payroll from 75 percent to 60 percent.  An Economic Injury Disaster Loan (“EIDL”) is an SBA-administered loan designed to provide assistance to small businesses that suffer substantial economic injury as a result of a declared disaster.  An EIDL helps businesses meet necessary financial obligations that could have been met had the disaster not occurred.  It provides relief from economic injury that the disaster caused and permits businesses to maintain a reasonable working capital position during the period that the disaster affected.  In March 2020, the SBA issued an EIDL declaration making EIDL loans available to small businesses to help alleviate economic injury caused by COVID-19.
Brooks is the owner of Cars Direct by Gavawn HWD Bob’s Motors (Cars Direct), the stated purpose of which was to purchase and sell cars.   Cars Direct was incorporated with the Maryland State Department of Assessments and Taxation (SDAT) on October 29, 2010.  Cars Direct was forfeited on October 1, 2012 and subsequently revived on May 28, 2020.  Brooks is listed as the resident agent with SDAT.
The affidavit alleges that, on May 9, 2020, Brooks applied for a PPP loan on behalf of Cars Direct in the amount of $1,556,589.  In support of the Cars Direct PPP loan application, Brooks allegedly submitted fraudulent tax forms which allegedly reported $724,469 in payments via Forms 1099-MISC and $7,471,630 in total unemployment payments to employees from Cars Direct.  However, as detailed in the affidavit, IRS records do not reflect any tax filings made by Cars Direct for any tax period, indicating that Cars Direct has not hired employees or paid unemployment taxes.  Additionally, the Maryland Department of Labor has no record of Cars Direct paying wages or of Brooks receiving wages.
On April 7, 2020, Brooks allegedly submitted an EIDL loan application on behalf of Cars Direct that contradicted the information and supporting documentation Brooks submitted for Cars Directs’ PPP loan application.  The EIDL application on behalf of Cars Direct allegedly stated that the company’s gross revenue was $148,000 and cost of goods sold was $82,293 in the one year period prior to COVID-19 being declared a disaster, which is inconsistent with a business that can support average monthly payroll costs of $622,635 or annual payments of $7,471,630 as Brooks reported on the PPP loan application and supporting fraudulent tax documents.
On May 9, 2020, Cars Directs’ PPP loan was approved and $1,556,589 was subsequently deposited into a bank account which has Brooks listed as the sole signer on the account.  Prior to the deposit of the PPP loan funds, payroll payments or payroll taxes were absent from this account. According to the affidavit, Brooks allegedly opened another bank account in the name of Payroll by BJM, into which he transferred $500,000 of PPP loan funds.  Brooks also then registered Payroll by BJM with SDAT, listing himself as resident agent.  Although the name Payroll by BJM creates the appearance that the account is associated with a payroll company, there has been no payroll or payroll-related expenses paid from this account.  Brooks also opened additional accounts in the name of Cars Direct, into which he transferred PPP loan funds.
After the deposit of PPP loan funds, Brooks initiated numerous transfers of PPP loan funds from the Cars Direct accounts to his personal bank accounts. Records revealed that Brooks used the PPP loan funds for personal expenditures including credit card bills, purchases at restaurants, retail stores, grocery stores, and automotive auctioneers, and mortgage payments for Brooks Cheltenham residence.
Beginning May 22, 2020, Brooks used PPP loan funds from the Cars Direct account and his own personal account to purchase of 39 used automobiles (including a 2017 Mercedes Benz S Class, two 2017 Infinity Q50s, a 2015 Cadillac Escalade, a 2005 Bentley Continental, a 2018 Tesla Model 3, a 2014 GMC Yukon XL, and several older model luxury vehicles. Under the terms of the PPP loan program, the purchase of these vehicles is not an appropriate use of loan funds.
According to the affidavit, on July 30, 2020, Brooks initiated a wire transfer from his personal account to Tesla Motors for $60,407, which was used to purchase a 2018 Tesla Model 3. “Rudolph Brooks” was listed as the customer for this vehicle, and a District of Columbia driver’s license was on file for a close relative of Brooks.  Records from the State of Maryland reflect that the Tesla Model 3 was registered in Brooks’s name at Brooks’s Cheltenham residence.
Finally, on August 13, 2020, Brooks initiated two wire transfers from one of the Cars Direct accounts for $144,343 and $2165 to a title company regarding a property in Baltimore, Maryland.  At the time of the wire transfers, $133,669.54 in funds from the Cars Direct PPP loan remained in the Cars Direct account.  Real estate deeds filed with the State of Maryland show that the Baltimore property was purchased by Madaro, LLC (Madaro) for $148,500.  Madaro was registered with the District of Columbia on August 8, 2019 and Brooks was listed as the resident agent of the company.  Brooks executed an Auction Contract of Sale on June 18, 2020 to purchase the Baltimore property.
In addition, seizure warrants authorized the seizure of up to $2,296,136.86 from eleven bank accounts and the 2018 Tesla Model 3 described above.  The affidavit in support of the seizure warrants alleges that these funds and vehicle constitute or are derived from the proceeds traceable to false statements made on bank loan applications.
If convicted, Brooks faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in federal prison for wire fraud followed by three years of supervised release.  Actual sentences for federal crimes are typically less than the maximum penalties.  A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after taking into account the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.
A criminal complaint is not a finding of guilt.  An individual charged by criminal complaint is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty at some later criminal proceedings.
Acting United States Attorney Jonathan F. Lenzner commended the FDIC OIG, the IRS-CI, the FBI, and the SBA OIG for their work in the investigation.  Mr. Lenzner thanked Assistant U.S. Attorneys Sean R. Delaney and Jessica Collins, who are prosecuting the case.

Washington Man Pleads Guilty to $244 Million Ghost-Cattle Scam,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/washington-man-pleads-guilty-244-million-ghost-cattle-scam,"March 31, 2021",2021,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Washington Man Pleads Guilty to $244 Million Ghost-Cattle Scam
A Washington man pleaded guilty today to defrauding Tyson Foods Inc. (Tyson) and another company (Company 1) out of more than $244 million by charging them under various agreements for the purported costs of purchasing and feeding hundreds of thousands of cattle that did not actually exist.
According to court documents, Cody Allen Easterday, 49, of Mesa, used his company, Easterday Ranches Inc., to enter into a series of agreements with Tyson and Company 1 under which Easterday Ranches agreed to purchase and feed cattle on behalf of Tyson and Company 1. Per the agreements, Tyson and Company 1 would advance Easterday Ranches the costs of buying and raising the cattle. Once the cattle were slaughtered and sold at market price, Easterday Ranches would repay the costs advanced (plus interest and certain other costs), retaining as profit the amount by which the sale price exceeded the sum repaid to Tyson and Company 1.
Beginning in approximately 2016 and continuing through November 2020, Easterday submitted and caused others to submit false and fraudulent invoices and other information to Tyson and Company 1. These false and fraudulent invoices sought and obtained reimbursement from the victim companies for the purported costs of purchasing and growing hundreds of thousands of cattle that neither Easterday nor Easterday Ranches ever purchased, and that did not actually exist. As a result of the scheme, Tyson and Company 1 paid Easterday Ranches over $244 million for the purported costs of purchasing and feeding these ghost cattle.
Easterday used the fraud proceeds for his personal use and benefit, and for the benefit of Easterday Ranches, including to cover approximately $200 million in commodity futures contracts trading losses that Easterday had incurred on behalf of Easterday Ranches. In connection with his commodity futures trading, Easterday also defrauded the CME Group Inc. (CME), which operates the world’s largest financial derivatives exchange. On two separate occasions, Easterday submitted falsified paperwork to the CME that resulted in the CME exempting Easterday Ranches from otherwise-applicable position limits in live cattle futures contracts.
“For years, Cody Easterday perpetrated a fraud scheme on a massive scale, increasing the cost of producing food for American families,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Nicholas L. McQuaid of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. “The Criminal Division’s prosecutors are committed to swiftly and thoroughly prosecuting frauds affecting our nation’s agricultural and other commodities markets, whether in the heartland or on Wall Street.”
“I commend the agents with the Federal Deposit Insurance Company Office of the Inspector General and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service for their dedication to investigating this case and tenacity in ferreting out the fraudulent activity to which the defendant has pleaded guilty,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Joseph H. Harrington for the Eastern District of Washington.
“Today’s guilty plea holds the defendant responsible for his extensive and coordinated fraud over many years, resulting in more than $240 million of illicit gains,” said Inspector General Jay N. Lerner of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation – Office of Inspector General (FDIC-OIG). “The defendant submitted false and fraudulent documentation, and then brazenly used the proceeds to cover his losses and for his personal benefit. This scheme was unraveled through rigorous and diligent investigative work with our law enforcement partners, and the FDIC-OIG remains committed to helping preserve the integrity of the banking sector.”
“Producing and providing false invoices and information on goods and services never delivered, were the fundamental key in defrauding an American multinational company out of hundreds of millions of dollars,” said Inspector in Charge Delany De León-Colón of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service Criminal Investigations Group. “This case highlights the collaborative investigative work undertaken by the U.S. Postal Inspection Service and its law enforcement partners to protect consumers and businesses from duplicitous practices. Anyone who engages in these fraudulent and deceptive activities will be brought to justice.”
Easterday pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud and agreed to repay $244,031,132 in restitution.  He is scheduled to be sentenced on August 4 and faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service are investigating the case.

Coppell Man Pleads Guilty to $24 Million COVID-Relief Fraud Scheme
A Coppell businessman pleaded guilty today to orchestrating a fraudulent scheme to obtain approximately $24.8 million in forgivable Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans and laundering the proceeds.
According to court documents, Dinesh Sah, 55, of Coppell, admitted that he submitted 15 fraudulent applications, filed under the names of various purported businesses that he owned or controlled, to eight different lenders seeking approximately $24.8 million in PPP loans.
Sah claimed that these businesses had numerous employees and hundreds of thousands of dollars in payroll expenses when, in fact, no business had employees or paid wages consistent with the amounts claimed in the PPP applications.
Sah further admitted that he submitted fraudulent documentation in support of his applications, including fabricated federal tax filings and bank statements for the purported businesses, and falsely listed other persons as the authorized representatives of certain of these businesses without the authority to use their identifying information on the applications.
“The Paycheck Protection Program was designed to aid struggling business owners, not to line the pockets of crafty profiteers,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Prerak Shah of the Northern District of Texas. “Even as fellow businesspeople tried desperately to procure the funds they needed to keep their business afloat, Sah dipped into federal coffers to fund his lavish lifestyle. The Justice Department is committed to protecting the PPP from fraud and deceit.”
“As the nation was crippled by a global pandemic, Sah fraudulently obtained over $17 million in PPP funds intended to help legitimate small businesses and spent that money on luxury cars and multiple homes,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Nicholas L. McQuaid of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. “As our nation continues to fight this unprecedented virus, the Department of Justice and its law-enforcement partners remain committed to aggressively pursuing individuals who exploit COVID-relief programs and to ensuring that these ill-gotten gains are returned.”
Sah admitted that, based on his false statements and fabricated documents, he received over $17 million in PPP loan funds and diverted the proceeds for his personal benefit, using them to purchase multiple homes in Texas, pay off the mortgages on other homes in California, and buy a fleet of luxury cars, including a Bentley convertible, Corvette Stingray, and Porsche Macan. Sah also sent millions of dollars in PPP proceeds in international money transfers. As part of his guilty plea, Sah will forfeit, among other property, eight homes, numerous luxury vehicles, and more than $7.2 million in fraudulent proceeds that the government seized to date.
Sah pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud and one count of money laundering in the Northern District of Texas. He will be sentenced at a later date and faces a maximum penalty of 30 years in federal prison.
The Dallas Field Offices of the FDIC-OIG, IRS-Criminal Investigation, and U.S. Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration are investigating the case.
Assistant Deputy Chief Anna G. Kaminska of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section and Section Chief Katherine Miller of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Texas are prosecuting the case. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Erica Hilliard and Dimitri Rocha are handling the asset-forfeiture component of the case.
The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act is a federal law enacted on March 29, 2020, designed to provide emergency financial assistance to the millions of Americans who are suffering the economic effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. One source of relief provided by the CARES Act was the authorization of up to $349 billion in forgivable loans to small businesses for job retention and certain other expenses, through the PPP. In April 2020, Congress authorized over $300 billion in additional PPP funding.
The PPP allows qualifying small businesses and other organizations to receive loans with a maturity of two years and an interest rate of 1%. PPP loan proceeds must be used by businesses on payroll costs, interest on mortgages, rent, and utilities. The PPP allows the interest and principal on the PPP loan to be forgiven if the business spends the loan proceeds on these expense items within a designated period of time after receiving the proceeds and uses at least a certain percentage of the PPP loan proceeds on payroll expenses.
The Fraud Section leads the Department of Justice’s prosecution of fraud schemes that exploit the CARES Act. In the months since the CARES Act was passed, Fraud Section attorneys have prosecuted more than 100 defendants in more than 70 criminal cases. The Fraud Section has also seized more than $65 million in cash proceeds derived from fraudulently obtained PPP funds, as well as numerous real-estate properties and luxury items purchased with such proceeds.

Raleigh County Pharmacist Sentenced to More Than 11 Years in Prison for Fraud Scheme
BECKLEY, W.Va. – A Raleigh County pharmacist was sentenced today to 135 months in federal prison for her role in a fraud scheme which cost victims over $2 million in losses. She was also ordered to pay over $2.5 million in restitution to the victims and serve a term of three years of supervised release.
According to court documents and admissions at the plea and sentencing hearings, Natalie P. Cochran, 40, of Daniels, owner of Technology Management Solutions (TMS) and Tactical Solutions Group (TSG) in Beckley, knowingly defrauded and took money and property from individuals, a financial institution and several other companies from approximately June 2017 through at least August 22, 2019. She persuaded them to invest in TMS and TSG and in phony government contracts by making false misrepresentations regarding her and her companies’ experience and purported success as government contractors.  Cochran convinced at least 11 people to invest approximately $2.5 million in alleged government contracts. The investors paid through personal checks, cashier’s checks and wire transfers. She also convinced an investor to send $511,920 through a wire transfer from North Carolina. Cochran never invested the money she received from victims, instead she put it into her personal and business bank accounts for personal purposes unrelated to the investments. Cochran admitted to using investor funds to make numerous purchases over $10,000, including withdrawing more than $37,500 to purchase a 1965 Shelby Cobra. She also admitted to knowing that at least one of her investors suffered a financial hardship as a result of her scheme.  As part of this scheme, Cochran used some investors’ funds to pay other investors a partial return on their investment.
Cochran pled guilty to wire fraud and money laundering charges on September 21, 2020.  Pursuant to her plea agreement, she also agreed to forfeit her interest to the United States in the assets she obtained through her fraudulent activities, including two pieces of real property, a 1965 Shelby Cobra, multiple vehicles, jewelry and nearly $45,000 seized from her business’ bank account.
“I want to commend the victims for the remarkable courage they displayed throughout the investigation and prosecution of this case,” said Acting United States Attorney Lisa G. Johnston. “I also want to thank the West Virginia State Police , the United States Secret Service, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation – Office of Inspector General (FDIC-OIG) and Assistant United States Attorneys Kathleen Robeson and Greg McVey who worked tremendously hard to ensure that the defendant was held accountable for the significant harm she inflicted on the victims.”
“The West Virginia State Police is proud that today we were able to secure justice for the numerous victims impacted by the selfish criminal conduct of Natalie Cochran,” said West Virginia State Police Lieutenant Timothy Bledsoe. “While this sentence does not undo the harm that Cochran brought upon each victim, we feel that our investigative efforts worked to ensure that she was held accountable for her criminal actions related to the operation of her Ponzi scheme.”
“The results of this investigation demonstrate the Secret Service’s commitment to protecting our nation’s financial institutions and citizens of West Virginia,” said U.S. Secret Service Resident Agent in Charge Robert W. Pyle.  “We will continue to work with local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies to bring offenders to justice. We would like to thank the West Virginia State Police and the FDIC-OIG for their cooperation and partnership in this case.”
“Today’s sentencing recognizes the importance of holding the defendant responsible for lying to a financial institution and investors, and fraudulently inducing them to finance her companies and fake government contracts,” said FDIC Inspector General Jay N. Lerner. “ The defendant then, in turn, purchased luxury items for her personal use with the illicit proceeds.  The FDIC Office of Inspector General remains committed to working with the U.S. Attorney and our law enforcement partners to bring to justice those who commit such flagrant offenses, and to help preserve the integrity of the banking sector.”
United States District Judge Frank W. Volk imposed the sentence.

Sussex County Man Charged with $1.9 Million Paycheck Protection Program Fraud Scheme,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/sussex-county-man-charged-19-million-paycheck-protection-program,"March 18, 2021",2021,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Sussex County Man Charged with $1.9 Million Paycheck Protection Program Fraud Scheme
NEWARK, N.J. – A Sussex County, New Jersey, man was charged for his role in fraudulently obtaining federal Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans totaling $1.9 million, Acting U.S. Attorney Rachael A. Honig announced.
John Jhong, 51, of Sparta, New Jersey, is charged by complaint with one count of bank fraud, one count of false representation of a Social Security number and one count of money laundering. Jhong is scheduled to make his initial appearance by videoconference this afternoon before U.S. Magistrate District Judge Leda Dunn Wettre.
According to documents filed in this case and statements made in court:
Jhong submitted 10 fraudulent PPP loan applications to several lenders on behalf of 10 purported businesses. The PPP is overseen by the Small Business Administration designed to provide forgivable loans to small businesses affected by the coronavirus pandemic. Applicants for PPP loans apply directly to banks or financial institutions participating in the program; in those applications, applicants make affirmative certifications about their average monthly payroll expenses and number of employees. Applicants also certify their intent to spend PPP proceeds on permissible business expenses, such as payroll costs, rent, utilities, and interest on mortgages. PPP loans may be entirely forgiven if the recipient spends the loan proceeds on these permissible expenses within a designated period after receiving the proceeds.
Jhong’s PPP applications allegedly contained false and fraudulent representations to the participating lenders, including documentation purporting to be from the IRS. In fact, according to IRS records, none of the tax documents Jhong submitted with the PPP loan applications were ever filed with the IRS. Jhong also fabricated the existence of numerous business partners. In some instances, the personal identifying information for Jhong’s purported business partners belonged to individuals who had been deceased for over a decade.
Based on Jhong’s alleged misrepresentations, the lenders approved Jhong’s PPP loan applications and provided Jhong’s purported business with $1.9 million in federal COVID-19 emergency relief funds meant for distressed small businesses. Jhong then converted a portion of the proceeds into a cashier’s check that was used to fund a business account.
The count of bank fraud carries a maximum penalty of 30 years in prison and a $1 million fine, or twice the gross gain to the defendant or gross loss to the victim, whichever is greater. The count of false representation of Social Security number carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine, or twice the gross gain to the defendant or gross loss to the victim, whichever is greater. The count of money laundering carries a maximum potential penalty of 20 years in prison and a $500,000 fine, or twice the gross gain to the defendant or gross loss to the victim, whichever is greater.
Acting U.S. Attorney Rachael Honig credited special agents of IRS – Criminal Investigation, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Michael Montanez; special agents of U.S. Postal Inspection Service, under the direction of Acting Inspector in Charge Rodney M. Hopkins; special agents of the Social Security Administration, Office of the Inspector General, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge John F. Grasso; special agents of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation – Office of the Inspector General, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Patricia Tarasca in New York; and special agents of the U.S. Secret Service, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Mark McKevitt. She also thanked the Sparta Township Police for their assistance.
The government is represented by Assistant U.S. Attorney Olajide A. Araromi of the U.S. Attorney’s Office, Government Fraud Unit, in Newark, and Trial Attorney Chad M. Davis of the  Department of Justice, Criminal Division, Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section.

Tech Executive Pleads Guilty to Wire Fraud and Money Laundering in Connection with PPP Loans
A Washington man pleaded guilty today to wire fraud and money laundering in connection with his scheme to obtain over $5.5 million in Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans and laundering the proceeds.
Mukund Mohan, 48, of Clyde Hill, was charged in July 2020. According to the plea agreement and other records filed in the case, Mohan submitted at least eight fraudulent PPP loan applications on behalf of six different companies to federally insured financial institutions. In support of the fraudulent loan applications, Mohan made numerous false and misleading statements about the companies’ respective business operations and payroll expenses.
In support of the fraudulent loan applications, Mohan submitted fake and altered documents, including fake federal tax filings and altered incorporation documents. For example, Mohan misrepresented to a lender that, in 2019, his company Mahenjo Inc. had dozens of employees and paid millions of dollars in employee wages and payroll taxes. In support of Mahenjo’s loan application, Mohan submitted incorporation documents showing that he incorporated the company in 2018 and filed federal unemployment tax forms for 2019. In truth, Mohan purchased Mahenjo on the Internet in May 2020 and, at time he purchased the company, it had no employees and no business activity. The incorporation documents he submitted to the lender were altered and the federal tax filings he submitted were fake.
Quick action by federal law enforcement resulted in the seizure of nearly all of the federal loan funds from Mohan’s accounts. Mohan is scheduled to be sentenced on July 20 and faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.
The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act is a federal law enacted on March 29, 2020, designed to provide emergency financial assistance to the millions of Americans who are suffering the economic effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. One source of relief provided by the CARES Act was the authorization of up to $349 billion in forgivable loans to small businesses for job retention and certain other expenses through the PPP. In April 2020, Congress authorized over $300 billion in additional PPP funding.
The PPP allows qualifying small businesses and other organizations to receive loans with a maturity of two years and an interest rate of 1%. Businesses must use PPP loan proceeds for payroll costs, interest on mortgages, rent, and utilities. The PPP allows the interest and principal to be forgiven if businesses spend the proceeds on these expenses within a set time period and use at least a certain percentage of the loan towards payroll expenses.
Acting Assistant Attorney General Nicholas L. McQuaid of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division and Acting U.S. Attorney Tessa M. Gorman of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Washington made the announcement.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency – Office of Inspector General, IRS-Criminal Investigation, U.S. Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation – Office of Inspector General are investigating the case.
Trial Attorney Christopher Fenton of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Andrew Friedman of the Western District of Washington are prosecuting the case.

Former Kankakee Wastewater Utilities Official Pleads Guilty to Fraud,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/former-kankakee-wastewater-utilities-official-pleads-guilty,"March 2, 2021",2021,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Former Kankakee Wastewater Utilities Official Pleads Guilty to Fraud
URBANA, Ill. – Sentencing has been scheduled in June for a wastewater utilities official, Richard G. Simms, who pleaded guilty to defrauding Kankakee’s wastewater utilities, Kankakee River Metropolitan Agency (KRMA) and the city’s Environmental Service Utility (ESU), of more than $2 million. Simms, 73, currently of Marietta, Ohio, entered his guilty plea on March 1, by video conference, before U.S. Magistrate Judge Eric I. Long.
Simms, who owned and operated Simms Engineering, LTD., served for many years as executive director of KRMA, which was responsible for treating wastewater from its member municipalities, namely, Kankakee, Bradley, Bourbonnais, and Aroma Park, Ill. Simms was also the Superintendent of ESU that serves as Kankakee’s public works and sewer system.
Simms admitted that from 2014 through 2018, he fraudulently received approximately $2.2 million as payment to Simms Engineering for software development by Plum Flower International, a business that Simms and his daughter started in 2014. Although Simms did not have board approval or contracts with his engineering firm to develop software, he submitted fraudulent and inflated invoices for payment. Simms circumvented KRMA’s invoice payment procedure by submitting invoices directly to its accounting firm. As a result, KRMA’s superintendent and administrative assistant did not approve the invoices and were unaware of the Simms Engineering invoices for software development.
Simms Engineering transferred more than $2 million to Plum Flower International from 2014 to 2018, which represented more than 95% of Plum Flower’s revenue. Approximately $161,000 was used to pay another company to create a software application which they attempted to sell on the open market. Most of the remaining funds were used by Simms and his daughter for their personal benefit.
Sentencing is scheduled on June 28. The offense of federal program fraud carries a maximum statutory penalty of 10 years in prison.
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General conducted the investigation. Assistant U.S. Attorney Eugene L. Miller is representing the government in the case prosecution.

Former Bank CEO Sentenced To Prison For Falsifying Bank Records, Misappropriating More Than $1.6 Million
Acting United States Attorney W. Anders Folk today announced the sentencing of ROBERT JOHN HAGER, 70, a former bank CEO, to 18 months in prison for making a false entry in bank records. HAGER, who pleaded guilty on May 18, 2020, was sentenced earlier today by Judge Patrick J. Schiltz in U.S. District Court.
According to the defendant’s guilty plea and documents filed with the court, HAGER was the CEO of Border State Bank (“Border”) and served as a director of the bank’s holding company, Border Bancshares, Inc. HAGER also held various executive positions in banks that Border Bancshares, Inc. acquired, including the former First State Bank of Clearbrook and the former First Advantage Bank. In late 2015 and early 2016, HAGER loaned money to a bank customer to invest in a diamond and gold venture in Liberia, Ghana, and Kenya that promised a quick return. After he depleted his own personal funds on the investment and maxed out the amount he could borrow from the bank, HAGER asked other individuals, including bank customers, shareholders, and directors of the bank to lend him money, which would enable HAGER to recover his personal funds.
According to the defendant’s guilty plea and documents filed with the court, between 2016 and 2017, HAGER requested a series of loans by having Border bank customers take out loans in their own names, or draw from loans they already had, and then transfer the funds to HAGER. In May 2016, HAGER issued three unauthorized Standby Letters of Credit (SBLCs) worth $1.6 million to facilitate the purchase and delivery of diamonds and gold from Africa. In each instance, Hager issued the SBLC on the letterhead of First Advantage Bank and signed the letter as CEO of First Advantage. Letters of Credit are considered obligations of a bank, and they can impact a bank’s financial standing.  Such obligations must be entered into the bank’s general ledger so that they can be accounted for and tracked by regulators. In order to conceal his actions, HAGER failed to report the SBLCs to bank personnel so that they could be logged into the bank’s system.
This case was the result of an investigation conducted by the Office of Inspector General for the Federal Reserve Board, the Office of Inspector General for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the FBI.
This case was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Amber M. Brennan.

Four New Defendants Added to Federal Indictment Alleging Multi-Million Dollar Embezzlement Conspiracy Resulting in Failure of Chicago Bank,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/four-new-defendants-added-federal-indictment-alleging-multi,"February 26, 2021",2021,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Four New Defendants Added to Federal Indictment Alleging Multi-Million Dollar Embezzlement Conspiracy Resulting in Failure of Chicago Bank
CHICAGO — An ongoing federal criminal investigation into the failure of Washington Federal Bank for Savings has resulted in charges against four new defendants, three of whom are alleged to have embezzled a total of more than $23 million from the Chicago bank.
Washington Federal was shut down in December 2017 after the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency determined that the bank was insolvent and had at least $66 million in nonperforming loans.  Four former Washington Federal employees, including the bank’s Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, were indicted last year for allegedly conspiring with an Illinois attorney – ROBERT M. KOWALSKI, of Chicago – and others to embezzle money from the bank in the years preceding the closure.  On Thursday, a federal grand jury in Chicago returned a superseding indictment that added four more defendants, including the bank’s former Vice President, bringing the total number of charged defendants to ten.
The new charges allege that the Vice President – JAMES R. CROTTY, 41, of Tinley Park, Ill. – joined several of the other defendants in a conspiracy to embezzle at least $31 million in bank funds.  Crotty and the other conspirators transferred bank funds to the attorney and the three other new defendants – real estate developers BOGUSLAW KASPROWICZ, 63, of Burbank, Calif., and MIROSLAW KREJZA, 62, of Chicago, and contractor MAREK MATCZUK, 57, of Park Ridge, Ill. – and others, without all of the required documentation and often without any documentation whatsoever, the indictment states.  The conspirators allegedly falsified bank records to conceal the embezzlement from the OCC and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
The new charges further allege that, of the $14.3 million that Kasprowicz embezzled, at least $1.6 million was used by Kasprowicz for the benefit of the bank’s former President, who has since died and is not charged in the indictment.  Kasprowicz allegedly paid credit card accounts in the name of the bank President or an entity associated with him, and also made payments to another bank for a loan on the purchase of a $450,000 Sea Ray powerboat called “Expelliarmus.”
The superseding indictment charges all ten defendants with conspiracy to commit embezzlement.  Kasprowicz also faces several tax charges for allegedly underreporting his personal and corporate income in numerous tax returns.  The indictment also renews tax charges against Robert Kowalski, as well as bankruptcy fraud charges against Robert Kowalski and his sister, JAN R. KOWALSKI, of LaGrange, for allegedly defrauding Robert Kowalski’s creditors and the trustee in his bankruptcy case.
In addition to Crotty, the former bank employees charged in the conspiracy are: ROSALLIE C. CORVITE, of Chicago, who served as Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; JANE V. IRIONDO, formerly known as Jane V. Tran, of Boise, Idaho, who served as Corporate Secretary; ALICIA MANDUJANO, of Chicago, who worked as a loan servicer; and CATHY M. TORRES, of Chicago, who worked as a loan officer.
Arraignments on the new charges are set for March 4, 2021, at 10:00 a.m., before U.S. District Judge Virginia M. Kendall in Chicago.
The superseding indictment was announced by John R. Lausch, Jr., United States Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois; Jay N. Lerner, Inspector General of the FDIC’s Office of Inspector General; Tamera Cantu, Acting Special Agent-in-Charge of IRS Criminal Investigation in Chicago; Emmerson Buie, Jr., Special Agent-in-Charge of the Chicago Field Office of the FBI; Catherine Huber, Special Agent-in-Charge of the Central Region of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, Office of Inspector General; Brad Geary, Special Agent-in-Charge of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's Office of Inspector General in Chicago; Joseph M. Ferguson, City of Chicago Inspector General; and Elissa Rhee-Lee, Chicago Housing Authority Inspector General.  Valuable assistance was provided by the U.S. Trustee Program and the Department of the Treasury, Office of Inspector General.  The government is represented by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Brian Netols, Michelle Petersen, Jeremy Daniel, and Nicholas Eichenseer.
The public is reminded that an indictment is not evidence of guilt.  The defendants are presumed innocent and entitled to a fair trial at which the government has the burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

Six Foreign Nationals and a Bank Employee Facing Federal Indictment in Maryland for a Scheme to Defraud Financial Institutions
Conspirators Allegedly Deposited Checks Stolen From Churches Into Fraudulently Opened Bank Accounts, Then Withdrew The Stolen Funds
Greenbelt, Maryland – A federal grand jury in Maryland has returned a superseding indictment charging six foreign nationals and a bank employee for a bank fraud scheme in which the defendants and their co-conspirators obtained or attempted to obtain more than $700,000.  The defendants, Diape Seck, age 27, of Rockville, Maryland; Nicolae Gindac, age 52, of Dania Beach, Florida; Mateus Vaduva a/k/a “Romi”, age 28; Marius Vaduva, age 26; Marian Unguru, age 36; Daniel Velcu, age 43; and Vali Unguru, age 18, all of Baltimore, Maryland are charged with a federal bank fraud and wire fraud conspiracy.  The superseding indictment was returned on February 17, 2021 and was unsealed in part at Diape Seck’s initial appearance on February 22, 2021.
The superseding indictment was announced by Acting United States Attorney for the District of Maryland Jonathan F. Lenzner; Postal Inspector in Charge Peter R. Rendina of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service - Washington Division; Special Agent in Charge James R. Mancuso of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Baltimore; Special Agent in Charge Shimon R. Richmond of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of Inspector General (FDIC-OIG); Chief Marcus Jones of the Montgomery County Police Department; Chief Toni Dezomits of the Cary, North Carolina, Police Department; and Sheriff Dusty Rhoades of the Williamson County, Tennessee, Sheriff’s Office.
According to the superseding indictment and other court documents, from June 2018 to January 2021, conspirators fraudulently opened bank accounts at victim financial institutions.  The conspirators stole checks from the incoming and outgoing mail of churches and other religious institutions, then deposited the stolen checks into the fraudulently opened bank accounts.  The conspirators then allegedly withdrew the funds and spent the fraudulently obtained proceeds.
Specifically, the superseding indictment alleges that Diape Seck, an employee of one of the victim financial institutions, facilitated the opening of multiple bank accounts at that institution for the co-conspirators.  Mateus Vaduva, Marius Vaduva, Nicolae Gindac, Marian Unguru, Daniel Velcu, Vali Unguru and their co-conspirators allegedly used foreign identity documents, often but not universally Romanian, in both their true identities as well as suspected fictitious identities, to fraudulently open bank accounts at victim financial institutions.  The co-conspirators then fraudulently negotiated the stolen checks by depositing the stolen checks into the victim bank accounts, often by way of automated teller machine (ATM) transactions.   After depositing the stolen checks into the bank accounts, the conspirators allegedly made cash withdrawals from ATMs and purchases using debit cards associated with the bank accounts.
According to court documents, an investigation by the victim bank where Diape Seck worked revealed that Seck allegedly violated numerous bank policies in opening approximately 412 checking accounts in a one-year period from approximately January 2, 2019 through January 3, 2020, relying predominantly on Romanian passports and driver's license information.  Checks payable to and written from churches and other religious institutions from around the country were allegedly deposited into many of the 412 checking accounts which were not opened in the names of the churches.  Law enforcement determined that the church checks were stolen.
For example, the indictment alleges that:  on October 24, 2019, Diape Seck opened, and aided and abetted the opening of, five fraudulent bank accounts in the names of “E.V.,” “L.U.,” “R.P.,” “G.B.,” and “F.P.”; on October 25, 2019, Mateus Vaduva opened a fraudulent bank account in the name of “W.H.”; on November 12, 2019, Marius Vaduva opened three fraudulent bank accounts in the names of “P.P.,” “M.C.,” and “N.V.”; on January 21, 2020, Daniel Velcu negotiated a stolen check into a victim bank account using an ATM in Glen Burnie, Maryland; on April 12, 2020, Nicolae Gindac negotiated two checks that had been stolen from churches in Ellicott City and La Plata, Maryland into a fraudulently opened bank account in the name of “D.B.”, using an ATM in Davie, Florida; on April 15, 2020, Marian Unguru negotiated three stolen checks and withdrew $500 in cash from a fraudulently opened bank account in Glen Burnie, Maryland; and on July 13, 2020, Vali Unguru negotiated a stolen check into a fraudulently opened bank account using an ATM in Baltimore, Maryland.
If convicted, the defendants each face a maximum sentence of 30 years in federal prison for conspiracy to commit bank fraud and wire fraud.  Actual sentences for federal crimes are typically less than the maximum penalties. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after taking into account the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.  Diape Seck had his initial appearance on February 22, 2021, and was ordered to be released pending trial.  Marian Unguru, Daniel Velcu, and Vali Unguru previously had initial appearances in U.S. District Court in Greenbelt.  Marian Unguru and Daniel Velcu were ordered to be detained pending trial and Vali Unguru was released pending trial.  The remaining defendants are each expected to have an initial appearance in U.S. District Court in Greenbelt, but no dates have been scheduled.
A superseding indictment is not a finding of guilt.  An individual charged by superseding indictment is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty at some later criminal proceedings.
Acting United States Attorney Jonathan F. Lenzner commended the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, HSI, the FDIC Office of Inspector General, the Montgomery County Police Department, the Cary (North Carolina) Police Department, and the Williamson County (Tennessee) Sheriff’s Office for their work in the investigation.  Mr. Lenzner thanked Assistant U.S. Attorney Elizabeth Wright, who is prosecuting the case.

PEWAUKEE MAN PLEADS GUILTY TO DIRECTING COVID-RELIEF FRAUD SCHEME
Acting U.S. Attorney Richard G. Frohling of the Eastern District of Wisconsin joined Acting Assistant Attorney General Nicholas L. McQuaid of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division and other federal officials in announcing that on February 23, 2021, Thomas Smith (age: 46) of Pewaukee, Wisconsin, pleaded guilty to one count of bank fraud for his role in fraudulently obtaining over $1 million in Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (SBA) under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.
The announcement of the plea was made jointly with Special Agent in Charge Sharon Johnson of the Small Business Administration’s Office of Inspector General (SBA-OIG); Special Agent in Charge Robert Hughes of the FBI’s Milwaukee Field Office; Special Agent in Charge John Crawford of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation – Office of Inspector General (FDIC-OIG); and Acting Special Agent in Charge Tamera D. Cantu of the IRS Criminal Investigation (CI) Milwaukee Field Office.
As part of his guilty plea, Smith admitted that he fraudulently sought over $1.2 million in PPP loans through applications to an insured financial institution on behalf of eight different companies. According to his plea agreement, Smith caused fraudulent loan applications to be submitted that made numerous false and misleading statements about the companies’ respective payroll expenses. Based on these representations, the financial institution approved and funded over $1 million in loans. According to plea documents, Smith then directed his co-conspirators to send him portions of the PPP funds within days of receiving them and used the proceeds for personal expenses.
United States District Judge Brett Ludwig scheduled Smith’s sentencing for June 2, 2021.
The CARES Act is a federal law enacted on March 29, 2020, designed to provide emergency financial assistance to the millions of Americans who are suffering the economic effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. One source of relief provided by the CARES Act was the authorization of up to $349 billion in forgivable loans to small businesses for job retention and certain other expenses, through the PPP. In April 2020, Congress authorized over $300 billion in additional PPP funding, and in December 2020, Congress authorized another $284 billion in additional funding.
The PPP allows qualifying small businesses and other organizations to receive loans with a maturity of two years and an interest rate of one percent. PPP loan proceeds must be used by businesses for payroll costs, interest on mortgages, rent, and utilities. The PPP allows the interest and principal to be forgiven if businesses spend the proceeds on these expenses within a set time period and use at least a certain percentage of the loan towards payroll expenses.
This case was investigated by the SBA-OIG, FBI, FDIC-OIG, and IRS-CI. Trial Attorneys Laura Connelly and Leslie S. Garthwaite of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Stephen Ingraham of the Eastern District of Wisconsin are prosecuting the case.
The Fraud Section leads the department’s prosecution of fraud schemes that exploit the PPP. In the months since the PPP began, Fraud Section attorneys have prosecuted more than 100 defendants in more than 70 criminal cases. The Fraud Section has also seized more than $60 million in cash proceeds derived from fraudulently obtained PPP funds, as well as numerous real estate properties and luxury items purchased with such proceeds.

Bank President’s Arson and Fraud Scheme Goes Up in Smoke
SHERMAN, Texas – A former bank president has been sentenced to federal prison for violations in the Eastern District of Texas, announced Acting United States Attorney Nicholas J. Ganjei today.
Anita Gail Moody, 57, of Cooper, Texas pleaded guilty on June 5, 2020, to conspiracy to commit bank fraud and arson and was sentenced to 96 months in federal prison today by U.S. District Judge Amos L. Mazzant, III.  Moody has additionally agreed to pay restitution in the amount of $11,136,241.82.
According to information presented in court, on May 11, 2019, while Moody was President of Enloe State Bank in Cooper, Texas, the bank suffered a fire that investigators later determined to be arson.  The fire was contained to the bank’s boardroom, however the entire bank suffered smoke damage.  Investigation revealed that several files had been purposefully stacked on the boardroom table, all of which were burned in the fire.  Notably, the bank was scheduled for a review by the Texas Department of Banking the very next day.  Further investigation revealed Moody had created false nominee loans in the names of several people, including actual bank customers.  Moody eventually admitted to setting the fire in the boardroom to conceal her criminal activity concerning the false loans.  She also admitted to using the fraudulently obtained money to fund her boyfriend’s business, other businesses of friends, and her own lifestyle.  The fraudulent activity, which began in 2012, resulted in a loss to the bank of approximately 11 million dollars.
“Criminal conduct that affects the financial health of a small, local lender can send a negative ripple effect throughout the entire community,” said Acting United States Attorney Nicholas J. Ganjei.  “The Eastern District of Texas will vigorously prosecute cases, such as the one here, that undermine public confidence in our local banks.  We are also deeply appreciative of the excellent investigative work of the FDIC Office of the Inspector General, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives in bringing this matter to a close.”
Jeannie Swaim, who served as vice president of Enloe State Bank, and who was also involved in fraudulent conduct, was previously sentenced to 24 months’ imprisonment, and agreed to pay restitution in the amount of $410,675.18.
This case was investigated by the FDIC-OIG and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives and prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys Maureen Smith and Wes Wynne.

BUFFALO, N.Y. – A Buffalo, New York man was charged in a criminal complaint unsealed today for his alleged participation in a scheme to defraud multiple financial institutions by filing bank loan applications that fraudulently sought forgivable Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (SBA) under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.
Acting Assistant Attorney General Nicholas L. McQuaid of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney James P. Kennedy, Jr. for the Western District of New York, Special Agent in Charge Patricia Tarasca of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation – Office of Inspector General (FDIC-OIG), Special Agent in Charge William Kalb of the U.S. Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration’s Office of Inspector General’s (TIGTA-OIG’s) North East Field Office, Special Agent in Charge Stephen Belongia of the FBI’s Buffalo Field Office, and Special Agent in Charge Amaleka McCall-Brathwaite of the Small Business Administration’s Office of Inspector General (SBA-OIG), Eastern Region made the announcement.
Christian Johnson, 23, of Buffalo, was charged by criminal complaint with wire fraud, bank fraud, and false statements to a financial institution.
The complaint alleges that Johnson submitted multiple fraudulent PPP loan applications on behalf of a company called Million Man LLC (Million Man) to at least three financial institutions. The complaint alleges that these applications contained numerous false and misleading statements about Million Man’s business and operations, including the number of employees and average monthly payroll. The complaint further alleges that in support of the fraudulent loan applications, Johnson submitted falsified federal tax documents payroll records.
The CARES Act is a federal law enacted on March 29, 2020, designed to provide emergency financial assistance to the millions of Americans who are suffering the economic effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. One source of relief provided by the CARES Act was the authorization of up to $349 billion in forgivable loans to small businesses for job retention and certain other expenses, through the PPP. In April 2020, Congress authorized over $300 billion in additional PPP funding, and in December 2020, Congress authorized another $284 billion in additional funding.
The PPP allows qualifying small businesses and other organizations to receive loans with a maturity of two years and an interest rate of 1%. PPP loan proceeds must be used by businesses for payroll costs, interest on mortgages, rent and utilities. The PPP allows the interest and principal to be forgiven if businesses spend the proceeds on these expenses within a set time period and use at least a certain percentage of the loan towards payroll expenses.
A federal criminal complaint is merely an allegation. A defendant is presumed innocent until proven guilty.
This case was investigated by the FDIC-OIG, TIGTA-OIG, FBI, and SBA-OIG. Trial Attorneys Joshua N. DeBold and Matthew Reilly of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney David J. Rudroff of the U.S. Attorney’s Office of the Western District of New York are prosecuting the case.
The Fraud Section leads the Department’s prosecution of fraud schemes that exploit the PPP. In the nine months since the PPP began, Fraud Section attorneys have prosecuted more than 100 defendants in more than 70 criminal cases. The Fraud Section has also seized more than $60 million in cash proceeds derived from fraudulently obtained PPP funds, as well as numerous real estate properties and luxury items purchased with such proceeds.

Operator Of Highrise Advantage, LLC Indicted For Over $57 Million In Investment Fraud
Orlando, Florida – United States Attorney Maria Chapa Lopez announces the return of an indictment charging Avinash Singh (38, Orlando) with 10 counts of wire fraud and 6 counts of money laundering. Singh faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in federal prison for each wire fraud count, and up to 10 years’ imprisonment for each money laundering count.
According to court documents, Singh operated a local company by the name of Highrise Advantage, LLC. From February 2013 to September 2020, Singh received more than $57 million, from over 1,100 victims, that was to be invested in retail foreign currency contracts (“forex”) through Highrise. To induce his victims to invest, Singh claimed that he had a proven track record of success as a forex trader, that he was going to use the funds for investments in forex, and that he would “guarantee” that his victims would not lose any funds for any trading losses. Those representations were not true. Rather than invest his victims’ funds in forex trading as he had promised, Singh used funds from one investor to pay amounts owed to other investors. Singh did not invest the funds that he had promised but instead misappropriated at least $45 million in the form of payments to other investors and millions of dollars in personal expenses. Singh invested less than 5% of the funds that he had received in actual forex trading.
To cover up his scheme, Singh issued monthly statements that falsely represented that he had invested the funds in forex as he had promised and that he was making large profits. In fact, Singh’s investments, when he made them, often lost significant amounts of money, which Singh attempted to cover up by creating false monthly statements.
In connection with this criminal prosecution, the Asset Recovery Division of the U.S. Attorney’s Office has filed a civil complaint seeking the forfeiture of a residence purchased with move than $920,000 in wire fraud proceeds. Per Department of Justice policy, the United States will seek permission to use the funds forfeited in that action to remit back to the victims at a later date. The amount of restitution due to the victims will be determined at a later date.
The U.S. Attorney’s Office and the investigative agencies recognize the U.S. Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) for its assistance. The CFTC has filed a civil complaint in federal court against Singh, Highrise, and others ( Commodity Futures Trading Commission v. Highrise Advantage, LLC , Case No. 6:20-cv-1657-Orl-41GJK).
An indictment is merely a formal charge that a defendant has committed one or more violations of federal criminal law, and every defendant is presumed innocent unless, and until, proven guilty.
This case was investigated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation – Office of Inspector General, the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation, the St. Cloud IRS Federal Financial Crimes Task Force, and the State of Florida Office of Financial Regulation, with assistance from the U.S. Marshals Service. It will be prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Roger B. Handberg, and asset recovery will be handled by Assistant United States Attorney Nicole M. Andrejko.

Warren County Man Admits Role in Scheme to Deceive Bank and Bank Regulators
NEWARK, N.J. – A Warren County, New Jersey, man today admitted his role in a scheme to defraud a bank and bank regulators, Acting U.S. Attorney Rachael A. Honig announced.
Gary Ketchum, 73, of Hackettstown, New Jersey, pleaded guilty by videoconference before U.S. District Judge Kevin McNulty to a superseding information charging him with one count of conspiring to make false entries to deceive First State Bank and to deceive the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, FSB’s regulators.
According to documents filed in this case and statements made in court:
A three-phase scheme took place from 2009 to 2010. The first phase was to fraudulently infuse $7 million of capital into First State Bank (FSB). In the second phase of the scheme, conspirators caused FSB to make millions of dollars in loans based on material misrepresentations to cover up the fraudulent nature of the capital infusion and to end inquiries from FSB’s auditors. The final phase involved lying to the FDIC and FSB, among others, about the fraudulent capital infusion and loans.
In May 2017, a conspirator, Donna Conroy, pleaded guilty to her role and is awaiting sentencing. In October 2018, Ketchum, along with conspirators Joseph Natale, former CEO of FSB, formerly of Cranford, New Jersey, and Albert Gasparro were charged by indictment with conspiracy to deceive the FDIC and FSB, deceiving those two entities, conspiracy to commit bank fraud, and bank fraud. Natale is scheduled stand trial before Judge McNulty beginning on Nov. 1, 2021. The charges against Gasparro remain pending.
The conspiracy count to which Ketchum pleaded guilty carries a maximum potential penalty of five years in prison and a fine of $250,000, or twice the gross pecuniary gain derived from the offense or twice the gross loss sustained by any victim. Sentencing is scheduled for June 28, 2021.
Acting U.S. Attorney Honig credited special agents of the FDIC – Office of Inspector General, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Patricia Tarasca; special agents of the FBI, Newark Division, Red Bank Resident Agency, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge George M. Crouch Jr.; and inspectors of the Office of the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (SIGTARP), under the direction of Special Inspector General Christy Goldsmith Romero, with the investigation leading to today’s guilty plea.
The government is represented by Ari B. Fontecchio of the Economic Crimes Unit of the U.S. Attorney’s Office, District of New Jersey.
The charges and allegations against the remaining defendants are merely accusations, and they are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.

Man Purchased Lamborghini After Receiving $3.9 Million in PPP Loans
A Florida man pleaded guilty today for fraudulently obtaining approximately $3.9 million in Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans and using those funds, in part, to purchase a $318,000 Lamborghini sports car for himself.
Authorities seized the Lamborghini and $3.4 million from the bank accounts of David T. Hines, 29, of Miami, at the time of his arrest. Hines pleaded guilty today to one count of wire fraud and is scheduled to be sentenced on April 14.
Acting Assistant Attorney General Nicholas L. McQuaid of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Ariana Fajardo Orshan of the Southern District of Florida, Special Agent in Charge Kyle A. Myles of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC-OIG), Office of Investigation’s Atlanta Regional Office, Inspector in Charge Antonio Gomez of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service’s Miami Division, Special Agent in Charge Amaleka McCall-Brathwaite of the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) OIG, Investigations Division, Eastern Regional Office, Acting Special Agent in Charge Tyler R. Hatcher of the IRS Criminal Investigation (CI) Miami Office, and Acting Special Agent in Charge Stephen Donnelly of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection OIG, Eastern Region, made the announcement.
As part of his guilty plea, Hines admitted that he fraudulently sought millions of dollars in PPP loans through applications to an insured financial institution on behalf of different companies. Hines caused to be submitted fraudulent loan applications that made numerous false and misleading statements about the companies’ respective payroll expenses. The financial institution approved and funded approximately $3.9 million in PPP loans.
Hines further admitted that within days of receiving the PPP funds, he used the funds to purchase a 2020 Lamborghini Huracan sports car for approximately $318,000. Plea documents indicate that in the days and weeks following the disbursement of PPP funds, Hines did not make payroll payments that he claimed on his loan applications. He did, however, use the PPP proceeds for personal expenses.

Engineer Pleads Guilty to More Than $10 Million of COVID-Relief Fraud
A Texas engineer pleaded guilty today for filing fraudulent bank loan applications seeking more than $10 million dollars in forgivable loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (SBA) under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.
Acting Assistant Attorney General Nicholas L. McQuaid of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, Acting U.S. Attorney Nicholas J. Ganjei for the Eastern District of Texas, Inspector General Laura S. Wertheimer of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) – Office of Inspector General (OIG), Inspector General Jay N. Lerner of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) – OIG, Inspector General Hannibal “Mike” Ware of the SBA-OIG and Inspector in Charge Delany De Leon-Colón of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service’s (USPIS) Criminal Investigations Group made the announcement.
Shashank Rai, 30, of Beaumont, pleaded guilty to one count of making false statements to a bank. He was charged on May 13, 2020 , with violations of wire fraud, bank fraud, false statements to a financial institution, and false statements to the SBA.
As part of his guilty plea, Rai admitted that he sought millions of dollars in forgivable loans guaranteed by the SBA from two different banks by claiming to have 250 employees earning wages when, in fact, no employees worked for his purported business. Rai made two fraudulent claims to two different lenders for loans guaranteed by the SBA for COVID-19 relief through the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). In the application submitted to the first lender, Rai sought $10 million in PPP loan proceeds by fraudulently claiming to have 250 employees with an average monthly payroll of $4 million.  In the second application, Rai sought approximately $3 million in PPP loan proceeds by fraudulently claiming to have 250 employees with an average monthly payroll of approximately $1.2 million.
According to court documents, the Texas Workforce Commission provided information to investigators of having no records of employee wages having been paid in 2020 by Rai or his purported business, Rai Family LLC. In addition, the Texas Comptroller’s Office of Public Accounts reported to investigators that Rai Family LLC reported no revenues for the fourth quarter of 2019 or the first quarter of 2020.
According to court documents, materials recovered from the trash outside of Rai’s residence included handwritten notes that appear to reflect an investment strategy for the $3 million, which is the amount of money that Rai allegedly sought from the second lender.

Federal Grand Jury Indicts Two Brothers For Allegedly Defrauding The Payroll Protection Program
BUFFALO, NY – U.S. Attorney James P. Kennedy, Jr. announced today that a federal grand jury has returned an indictment charging Larry Jordan, 42, of Lancaster, NY, and Sutukh El a/k/a Curtis Jordan a/k/a Hugo Hurt, 38, of Buffalo, NY, with wire and bank fraud conspiracy, bank fraud, and engaging in monetary transactions with criminally derived property, for their alleged participation in a scheme to file fraudulent loan applications seeking nearly $7,000,000 in forgivable Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (SBA) under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. The charges carry a maximum penalty of 30 years in prison and a $1,000,000 fine.
“These brothers allegedly stole more than $600,000 which was intended to assist businesses and employees that have been crippled by the pandemic,” noted U.S. Attorney Kennedy. “Their greed in the face of a national crisis has rightly landed them in federal court under indictment. We will investigate and charge anyone who seeks to use emergency federal aid as a way to try to get rich quick.”
The indictment and a previously filed complaint allege that Larry Jordan and Sutukh El conspired to submit at least eight fraudulent loan applications in an attempt to obtain nearly $7,000,000 for their company, 5 Stems Inc. In support of the fraudulent loan applications, Larry Jordan and Sutukh El allegedly made numerous false and misleading statements about the companies’ respective business operations and payroll expenses. In furtherance of their efforts, defendants communicated over text message about some of the fraudulent loan applications. After receiving confirmation that a loan application had been approved, defendant Sutukh El sent texts to Jordan stating: “We really bout to take over the world,” and “Wow, we like Fake Rich.” Jordan replied: “We don’t even have to start paying back for 2 years,” and “Or just show what they ask us to show.” Another text from Sutukh El stated: “We’ll be in the billions by then anyway,” and “But definitely show what needs to be shown and write that (expletive) off!”  The indictment and complaint allege that the fraudulent loan applications were supported by fake documents, including falsified federal tax filings. For example, included in one application was a fraudulent IRS filing that appeared to be the company’s 2019 federal unemployment tax return (FUTA) showing that the company paid nearly $3,300,000 in employee wages that year. In reality, the IRS has no record of such a filing. Finally, the brothers are accused of using fraudulently obtained loan proceeds to pay personal expenses, including the purchase of securities, home improvements, and a vehicle. To date, the government has seized more than $400,000 of the more than $600,000 that Larry Jordan and Sutukh El actually obtained through their fraudulent scheme.
The defendants were arraigned today before U.S. Magistrate Judge H. Kenneth Schroeder, Jr., and released on conditions.

“Serial Fraudster” Sentenced to Two Years in Prison For Mail Fraud Conspiracy
GRAND RAPIDS, MICHIGAN — U.S. Attorney Andrew Birge announced today that Wavy Curtis Shain, 38, of La Grange, Kentucky was sentenced to 24 months in federal prison for conspiring to commit mail fraud.  Shain pleaded guilty to the charge in September 2020.  U.S. District Judge Janet T. Neff also ordered Shain to pay $23,373.92 in restitution and imposed a $40,000.00 fine.
In 2017, Shain was on supervised release for a prior federal mortgage fraud conviction when he conspired with an individual in the Western District of Michigan (“Person A”) to fraudulently obtain loans for an Okemos-based health care provider, Advanced Medical Services, P.L.L.C. (d/b/a Advanced Sleep Diagnostics of Michigan).  Shain received fraudulent loan documents, completed and signed in the name of another individual (“Person B”), from Person A.  Shain falsely authenticated those forged signatures by placing fake notary stamps and fake notary signatures on certain loan documents, including documents representing that Person B would personally guarantee the loans.  Shain then mailed the fraudulent loan documents to out-of-state lenders.  Person B was not aware that his identity was being used to procure these business loans.
In May 2018, during the investigation of Person A, Shain lied to the FBI and claimed he had no role in the loan applications.  At the time, however, Shain was using Person B’s identity in another loan fraud scheme.  At sentencing, Judge Neff described Shain as a “serial fraudster” and described crimes involving identity theft as “horrendous offenses against an individual.”
“The Court imposed a well-deserved sentence that reflects the seriousness and pattern of Shain’s financial crimes,” said U.S. Attorney Birge.  “I commend law enforcement—including our federal partners in Kentucky—for their extraordinary efforts in investigating this case.”
The investigation was conducted by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Michigan, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General, and Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan.  Agents from the IRS Criminal Investigation Division and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of Inspector General in Louisville, Kentucky provided substantial and valuable assistance in this case.  Assistant U.S. Attorney Adam B. Townshend represented the United States.

Grand Jury Returns Superseding Indictment Charging First NBC Bank Executives And A Borrower With Bank Fraud And False Statements,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/grand-jury-returns-superseding-indictment-charging-first-nbc,"January 29, 2021",2021,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Grand Jury Returns Superseding Indictment Charging First NBC Bank Executives And A Borrower With Bank Fraud And False Statements
NEW ORLEANS – The United States Attorney’s Office announced that a grand jury returned a superseding indictment against ASHTON J. RYAN, age 73, of Kenner; WILLIAM BURNELL, age 71, of Kenner; ROBERT BRAD CALLOWAY, age 60, of Metairie; FRANK J. ADOLPH, age 61, of Kenner; and FRED V. BEEBE, age 62, of Donaldsonville, for defrauding First NBC Bank, the New Orleans-based bank that failed in April 2017.
According to the 49-count Superseding Indictment, from 2006 through April 2017, RYAN, BURNELL, CALLOWAY, BEEBE, and ADOLPH conspired to defraud First NBC Bank (the “Bank”) through a variety of schemes. RYAN was the President and CEO of the Bank for most of its existence. BURNELL was the Chief Credit Officer. CALLOWAY was an Executive Vice President.  BEEBE was a Senior Vice President. ADOLPH was a borrower at the Bank who was charged with conspiring with the four Bank executives to obtain loans based on false statements and forged documents.
The Superseding Indictment alleges that RYAN, BURNELL, CALLOWAY, BEEBE, ADOLPH, and others conspired to defraud First NBC Bank by disguising the true financial status of certain borrowers and their troubled loans, concealing the true financial condition of the Bank from the Board, auditors, and examiners. The borrowers included real estate developer Gary Gibbs, real estate developer Kenneth Charity, Bank general counsel Gregory St. Angelo, factoring business owner FRANK ADOLPH, hotel owner Arvind “Mike” Vira, contractor Warren Treme, and contractor Jeffrey Dunlap. CALLOWAY was Gibbs’s loan officer while BEEBE worked as Treme’s loan officer. RYAN served as the loan officer or oversaw the loan officers for all of those borrowers. BURNELL approved the risk rating for all of these borrowers’ loans and was the gatekeeper tasked with protecting the safety and soundness of the Bank’s loan portfolio. Dunlap, Charity, St. Angelo, Vira, Gibbs, and Treme have all previously been charged in individual Bills of Information with conspiring to defraud First NBC Bank. All six of these borrowers are listed in the Superseding Indictment as members of the bank fraud conspiracy with RYAN, BURNELL, CALLOWAY, BEEBE, and ADOLPH.
During the course of the conspiracy, RYAN, BURNELL, CALLOWAY, and BEEBE repeatedly extended loans to borrowers who were unable to pay their loans without relying on loan payments to keep them current. To hide this practice, RYAN, BURNELL, CALLOWAY, and BEEBE made false statements in loan documents and elsewhere about the purposes of loans, the borrowers’ abilities to repay those loans, and the sources of funds used to pay those loans. When the borrowers were unable to pay those loans, RYAN, BURNELL, CALLOWAY, and BEEBE made new loans to these same borrowers and then used the proceeds from those new loans to pay the existing loans. This created the false impression that the borrowers were able to pay their loans, when in fact they would not have been able to pay their loans without going further into debt through new borrowing from the Bank. The new loans prevented these borrowers from appearing on lists that RYAN and BURNELL gave the Bank’s Board each month, which would have highlighted that the borrowers were unable to make loan payments or had cash flow problems. RYAN, BURNELL, CALLOWAY, and BEEBE also made false statements about the purpose of those loans, misrepresenting in Bank documents that the borrowers were able to pay loans with cash generated from the borrowers’ businesses, when in fact the borrowers were only able to pay those loans with proceeds from new Bank loans. The borrowers often spent the proceeds of these business loans on unrelated personal expenses, including by overdrawing their checking accounts at the Bank, and RYAN, BURNELL, CALLOWAY, and BEEBE paid these overdrafts by issuing new loans to the borrowers. This practice kept the borrowers off of month-end overdraft reports to the Board and hid the borrowers’ inability to pay their own expenses without new loan proceeds.
For certain loans, RYAN, BURNELL, CALLOWAY, and BEEBE included borrower documents in loan files despite knowing that the documents were false. For example, even after RYAN and BURNELL learned that ADOLPH was submitting falsified documents to the Bank to inflate his collateral, RYAN and BURNELL continued to submit loans for ADOLPH that included the false documents. Even though RYAN, BURNELL, and CALLOWAY knew that Gibbs could not pay his loans with cash generated from his businesses, they continued to submit loan documents that included false documents showing that Gibbs’s business earned enough cash to pay his loans at the Bank. Likewise, RYAN, BURNELL, and BEEBE submitted loan documents to authorize Bank funds to be loaned to Treme that included falsehoods relating to Treme’s creditworthiness and the purpose of the loans.
When members of the Board or the Bank’s outside auditors or examiners asked about loans to these borrowers, RYAN, BURNELL, CALLOWAY, and BEEBE made false statements about the borrowers and their loans, and left out the truth about the borrowers’ inability to pay their debts without getting new loans. As a result, the balance on these borrowers’ loans continued to grow. By the time regulators closed First NBC Bank in April of 2017, Gibbs owed the Bank $123 million; Charity owed $18 million; St. Angelo owed $46 million; ADOLPH owed $6 million; Vira owed $39 million; Treme owed $6 million; and Dunlap owed $22 million. The Bank’s failure cost the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation deposit insurance fund just under $1 billion.
RYAN, BURNELL, CALLOWAY, and BEEBE each received substantial compensation from the Bank during the course of the conspiracy. RYAN also received personal benefits from three of the borrower relationships. Vira lent millions of dollars to RYAN at the same time Vira was a borrower at the Bank, and RYAN and Vira conspired to hide their business dealings from the Board, auditors, and examiners. Treme was RYAN’s partner in several businesses and real estate development projects, and RYAN used Treme’s borrowing from the Bank as a way to spend Bank loan proceeds on RYAN’s own projects. Even when parts of RYAN’s business dealings with Vira and Treme were revealed to regulators, RYAN continued to conceal from regulators that he exercised authority over loans to Vira and Treme. Dunlap was a contractor for a business that RYAN and Treme ran, and RYAN used loan proceeds from Dunlap’s business to benefit his own development project, Wadsworth Estates. RYAN never disclosed his business relationship with Dunlap to the Board, auditors, or examiners. BURNELL was aware of this business relationship and also never disclosed it to the Board, auditors, or examiners.
“Along with our partners, the FBI has dedicated significant time and resources toward investigating the failure of First NBC Bank, which resulted in nearly a billion dollar loss to the FDIC,” stated FBI New Orleans Special Agent in Charge Bryan Vorndran. “We will continue to investigate allegations of fraud by First NBC bank insiders until all those responsible for its failure are identified and brought to justice.”
“Today’s indictment sends a clear message that bank executives who engage in fraud that impacts the safety and soundness of financial institutions will be held accountable for their actions,” said Stephen Donnelly, Acting Special Agent in Charge, Eastern Region, Office of Inspector General for the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection.
“Today’s indictment demonstrates the FDIC OIG and our law enforcement partners will continue to pursue individuals who defraud our insured financial institutions and cause harm to the nation’s banking industry,” said Anand Ramlall, Special Agent in Charge, Dallas Region, Office of Inspector General for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
RYAN, BURNELL, CALLOWAY, BEEBE, and ADOLPH are each charged in Count 1 of the Superseding Indictment with conspiracy to commit bank fraud, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Sections 1344 and 1349. RYAN, BURNELL, CALLOWAY, BEEBE, and ADOLPH are also charged with multiple instances of bank fraud, as listed in Counts 2 through 37, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1344. RYAN, BURNELL, BEEBE, and CALLOWAY are charged with making false entries in bank records, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1005, as listed in Counts 38 through 49. For each of the charged counts, the maximum penalties that may be imposed upon conviction are thirty years in prison; a fine of $1,000,000, or the greater of twice the gain to a defendant or twice the loss to any victim; up to five years of supervised release; and a $100 mandatory special assessment.
The United States Attorney’s Office stated that an Indictment is merely an accusation and that the guilt of the defendants must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.
This case is being investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation; the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of Inspector General; and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Office of Inspector General. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Sharan E. Lieberman, Matthew R. Payne, Nicholas D. Moses, J. Ryan McLaren, and K. Paige O’Hale are in charge of the prosecution.

Man Pleads Guilty to $2.5 Million Coronavirus Fraud,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/man-pleads-guilty-25-million-coronavirus-fraud,"January 28, 2021",2021,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Man Pleads Guilty to $2.5 Million Coronavirus Fraud
ALEXANDRIA, Va. – A Leesburg man pleaded guilty today to fraudulently obtaining two loans for over $2.5 million under the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”).
“At a time when countless families and business owners nationwide are struggling to make ends meet during the ongoing pandemic, Didier Kindambu committed a multimillion-dollar bank fraud by misappropriating COVID-19 taxpayer relief funds to pay for his lavish lifestyle,” said Raj Parekh, Acting U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. “Together with our law enforcement partners, this Office will continue to prosecute and bring to justice those who seek to exploit essential pandemic recovery programs and profit from the misfortunes of others for personal gain.”
According to court documents, Didier K. Kindambu, 49, fraudulently obtained two PPP loans under a program instituted by the U.S. Congress to help businesses affected by the coronavirus pandemic continue to pay salary or wages to their employees. Kindambu carried out the scheme in connection with two businesses that he owns by creating fraudulent payroll documentation for each business, and then submitting that documentation in support of the PPP loan applications. The fraudulent documentation represented that Kindambu’s businesses had dozens of employees with millions of dollars in payroll expenses, when in fact they had few, if any, employees.
In total, Kindambu fraudulently obtained approximately $2,501,753 in loan proceeds, and he then spent those funds, in part, on items unrelated to any legitimate PPP-related expense. Those items included a Lexus automobile and Cessna aircraft; Kindambu’s personal taxes, the down-payment on a luxury residence in Leesburg, and his day-to-day living expenses; and various purchases of jewelry, clothing, accessories, and shoes.
Kindambu pleaded guilty to bank fraud and is scheduled to be sentenced on August 4, 2021. He faces a maximum penalty of 30 years in prison. Actual sentences for federal crimes are typically less than the maximum penalties. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after taking into account the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.
Raj Parekh, Acting U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia; Kelly R. Jackson, Special Agent in Charge, Washington, D.C. Field Office, IRS-Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI); Hannibal “Mike” Ware, Inspector General of the Small Business Administration (SBA); and Jay N. Lerner, Inspector General of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC-OIG), made the announcement after U.S. District Judge Rossie D. Alston accepted the plea.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Matthew Burke is prosecuting the case.

Former Rocky Mountain Bank loan officer sentenced to prison, fined for fraud, money laundering crimes
BILLINGS – A former Rocky Mountain Bank loan officer who admitted to approving loans to a bank customer while at the same time profiting from private, undisclosed loans to the customer was sentenced today to one year and one day in prison followed by three years of supervised release and fined $50,000, Acting U.S. Attorney Leif Johnson said.
Stephen Phillip Casher, 47, pleaded guilty on June 24, 2020 to bank fraud and to money laundering. Casher was charged in a 14-count superseding indictment alleging bank fraud and related crimes. A jury trial began on June 22, 2020. The prosecution and Casher reached a plea agreement during trial.
U.S. District Judge Susan P. Watters presided. Judge Watters allowed Casher to self-report to prison.
The prosecution presented evidence that Casher worked as a market president for Rocky Mountain Bank (RMB) from about November 2011 until January 2017. During that time, Casher was one of the people responsible for approving bank loans to Larry Price, Jr. or one of Price's related companies. Casher, along with several private investors, also made large, private, high interest loans to Price. Though Casher helped approve many bank loans to Price, neither Casher nor Price disclosed the private loans to RMB. Casher never informed RMB that he had a conflict of interest that might impair his impartiality in reviewing loans involving Price.
In September 2014, RMB loaned H&P Investments $3.75 million. Price controlled H&P investments and acted as an unlimited guarantor of the loan. Casher was one of the bank officials who approved this loan and was responsible for collecting Price's personal financial statement and providing it to the bank. A few days before the bank loan, Casher, along with a private investor, privately loaned Price $900,000. The private loan was specifically concealed and omitted from the personal financial statement that Casher had arranged for Price to sign on the same day the private loan was executed, resulting in a false entry in RMB's books.
In June 2015, RMB loaned Seven Lands Holdings approximately $1.18 million. Price controlled Seven Lands Holdings and acted as a personal guarantor of the loan. Price used the loan to buy five houses and turn them into rental properties. In early 2015, several private investors associated with Casher loaned Price $1.5 million. Casher brokered this deal and eventually received $20,000 as a ""thank you"" from the private investors.
One of homes Seven Lands Holdings was buying belonged to Casher and, as a result, he was removed from RMB's chain of approval. Nevertheless, Casher provided lender information on the loan and was involved in preparing loan documents. Neither Casher nor Price informed RMB about the $1.5 million private loan before the bank loaned Seven Lands Holdings $1.18 million. RMB's entry misrepresented Price's net worth and liquidity. Casher personally profited from this RMB loan because he received a large portion of loan funds from the sale of his house.
Assistant U.S. Attorneys Colin Rubich, Zeno Baucus and Timothy Tatarka prosecuted the case, which was investigated by the FBI and the IRS.

Former Member of Hebron Bank Board of Directors Pleads Guilty to Federal Charge of Making False Statements to Obtain and Maintain Personal and Business Loans,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/former-member-hebron-bank-board-directors-pleads-guilty-federal,"January 14, 2021",2021,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Former Member of Hebron Bank Board of Directors Pleads Guilty to Federal Charge of Making False Statements to Obtain and Maintain Personal and Business Loans
Baltimore , Maryland – Brian Thomas Twilley, age 57, of Greenbackville, Virginia, formerly of Salisbury, Maryland, pleaded guilty yesterday to making a false statement on a loan or credit application.
The guilty plea was announced by United States Attorney for the District of Maryland Robert K. Hur; Special Agent in Charge Robert W. Manchak of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, Office of Inspector General (FHFA OIG); and Special Agent in Charge Shimon R. Richmond of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of Inspector General (FDIC OIG).
From 2011 through 2015, Brian Twilley served as a member of the Board of Directors for Hebron Savings Bank, located in Wicomico County, Maryland.  Twilley also owned a commercial printing business in Wicomico County and was a member of the faculty for the Economics and Finance Department at Salisbury University.
According to his guilty plea, from April 2010 through March 2017, Twilley provided false personal financial statements to Hebron that omitted from his net worth a $200,000 Home Equity Line of Credit (“HELOC”) due to Bank 2 that should have been paid off and closed with the proceeds of a separate HELOC that Twilley had obtained from Hebron.  Twilley also provided false personal financial statements to Bank 3.
As detailed in his plea agreement, in August 2006 Hebron issued Twilley a $350,000 HELOC for the purpose of paying off and closing his $200,000 HELOC at Bank 2.  As part of Hebron’s approval of the HELOC it required that Bank 2 release their lien on Twilley’s personal residence so that Hebron could secure a first-position lien on this collateral.  On August 28, 2006, Twilley signed a letter addressed to Bank 2 directing them to accept the payoff of the loan, close the HELOC account, and forward the release documents to Hebron.  The payoff was funded with a Teller’s Check issued by Hebron in the amount of $200,392.04, but the letter directing Bank 2 to close the loan was never delivered and the HELOC account at Bank 2 remained open.  Twilley admitted that he continued to make withdrawals of the available funds in Bank 2’s HELOC and by 2010 had withdrawn the full $200,000 available.
As a member of Hebron’s Board of Directors and as a condition of his ongoing loan relationship with Hebron, which included the $350,000 HELOC and multiple commercial loans, Twilley was required to provide Hebron with an annual personal net worth statement.  Twilley admitted that from 2010 through 2014 he provided Hebron with his personal financial statement, but failed to disclose the continued existence of the HELOC with Bank 2, which Hebron believed had been closed since 2006.
Further, in December 2014, as part of a request to renew a $100,000 commercial line of credit for his company with Bank 3, Twilley submitted a personal financial statement to Bank 3 that failed to disclose the existence of the HELOC with Bank 2 and the associated debt.  When Twilley was questioned by a representative of Bank 3 as to why his credit report reflected a $200,000 HELOC due to Bank 2 that was not listed on his net worth statement, Twilley falsely advised that the HELOC at Bank 2 had been closed when he opened the HELOC at Hebron.  The Bank 3 representative informed Twilley that Hebron may want to contact Bank 2 to have them close out the HELOC because Hebron’s secured position in the collateral might be behind Bank 2 if the lien was not released.
Twilley left his position as a member of Hebron’s Board of Directors in 2015.  By 2017 Twilley was having difficulty servicing his debts and Hebron attempted to restructure his loan payments.  As part of the negotiations, on March 17, 2017, Twilley again sent a personal financial statement to Hebron that failed to disclose the existence of his debt due on the HELOC with Bank 2, which then had a balance of approximately $176,000, thereby underreporting Twilley’s outstanding obligations.  When a representative subsequently suggested that the collateral for the Hebron HELOC be sold, they learned that Bank 2 still held a first-position lien on the property because the HELOC with Bank 2 had never been closed.  In July 2018 Twilley declared bankruptcy and Hebron restructured all of Twilley’s personal and commercial debts.  In November 2018, the collateral for the HELOC was sold and $163,081.88 of the proceeds was disbursed to Bank 2 as a lien holder in first position, depriving Hebron of the proceeds of the sale.
As part of his plea agreement, Twilley will be required to pay restitution of $163,081.88, the full amount of the victim’s loss.
Twilley faces a maximum sentence of 30 years in federal prison for making a false statement on a loan or credit application.  Actual sentences for federal crimes are typically less than the maximum penalties and are determined by a federal district court judge after taking into account the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.   U.S. District Judge Stephanie A. Gallagher has not yet scheduled a sentencing date for Twilley.
United States Attorney Robert K. Hur commended the FHFA OIG and FDIC OIG for their work in the investigation.  Mr. Hur thanked Assistant U.S. Attorney Sean R. Delaney, who is prosecuting the case.

Former Real Estate Developer Sentenced in Federal Court after Conspiring to Lie to a Bank
Lies Resulted in the Bank Losing Over $320,000, which Must be Paid Back
A former real estate developer who conspired with a bank vice president to lie to a bank for years was sentenced today to three years of probation.
Kenneth Moore, age 65, from Dubuque, Iowa, received the prison term after a February 3, 2020 guilty plea to one count of conspiracy to make a false statement to a financial institution.
Evidence and information disclosed during court hearings showed that between 2007 and 2009, Moore worked as a real estate developer in the Dubuque, Iowa, and Galena, Illinois, areas.  During that time, he conspired with Dan Raduns, who was a vice president at a bank in Dubuque.  Evidence showed that the two conspired to lie to the bank about how money the bank was loaning to Moore was being used.  Specifically, they lied about using the money to complete a particular construction project when, instead, it was being used elsewhere.  Ultimately, the bank lost over $320,000 in loans made on the construction project.
Moore was sentenced in Cedar Rapids by United States District Court Chief Judge Leonard T. Strand. Moore was sentenced to three years’ probation.  He was ordered to make $332,108.80 in restitution to the victim bank.  Raduns was also previously sentenced to three years’ probation and to make restitution to the victim.
The case was prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Anthony Morfitt and investigated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  Court file information is available at https://ecf.iand.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/login.pl .    The case file number is 19-CR-1021.

Accountant Who Aided Worldwide Scam Charged with Small Business Administration Loan Fraud
Miami, Fl. -- A former accountant who assisted in a scam involving valuable artwork and a Swiss bank account has been charged in connection with a scheme to fraudulently obtain a Small Business Administration (“SBA”) loan.

Two Owners of New York Pharmacies Charged in $30 Million Covid-19 Health Care Fraud and Money Laundering Scheme
BROOKLYN, NY – An indictment was unsealed in federal court in Brooklyn today charging the two owners of over a dozen pharmacies in New York City and on Long Island, for their roles in a $30 million health care fraud and money laundering scheme in which they exploited emergency codes and edits in the Medicare system that went into effect due to the COVID-19 pandemic in order to submit fraudulent claims for expensive cancer drugs that were never provided, ordered or authorized by medical professionals.  Peter Khaim and Arkadiy Khaimov are charged with one count of conspiracy to commit health care fraud and wire fraud, and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering.  Khaim was separately charged with two counts of concealment money laundering and one count of aggravated identity theft.  Khaimov was separately charged with two counts of concealment money laundering. The defendants were arrested this morning and will be arraigned this afternoon before Magistrate Judge Vera M. Scanlon.
Seth D. DuCharme, Acting United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York; Brian Rabbitt, Acting Assistant Attorney General of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division; William F. Sweeney, Jr., Assistant Director-in-Charge, Federal Bureau of Investigation, New York Field Office (FBI); Scott Lampert, Special Agent-in-Charge, Health and Human Services-Office of Inspector General, New York Region (HHS-OIG); Jonathan D. Larsen, Special Agent-in-Charge, Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigation, New York (IRS-CI); and Patricia Tarasca, Special Agent-in-Charge, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of Inspector General (FDIC-OIG), announced the arrests and indictment.
“As alleged in the indictment, the defendants manipulated information in over a dozen pharmacies to defraud the Medicare program, including by taking advantage of systems that were intended to assist patients during the COVID-19 pandemic, and then went to great lengths to hide their ill-gotten gains through a network of sham companies,” stated Acting United States Attorney DuCharme.  “This Office and our law enforcement partners are committed to holding accountable those who seek to enrich themselves at the expense of vital taxpayer-funded health care programs upon which so many rely.”
“These defendants allegedly lined their own pockets by exploiting Medicare flexibilities that were designed to ensure that patients obtained access to needed medications during the COVID-19 crisis,” stated Acting Assistant Attorney General  Rabbitt.  “Together with our law enforcement partners, the Criminal Division is working to aggressively identify, investigate and prosecute scammers who seek to take advantage of the COVID-19 crisis to defraud our public health care programs.”
“We allege Mr. Khaim and Mr. Khaimov used the COVID-19 pandemic as cover to exploit changes in the Medicare system,” stated FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge Sweeney.  “The changes to this program, funded by taxpayers, were put in place to help fellow citizens obtain needed medications during the pandemic, not line the pockets of fraudsters.  Those who attempt to illegally profit from our public funded healthcare programs should remember that taxpayers also fund courts and jails, and behavior like the type announced today will be met with swift action from the FBI and our law enforcement partners.  If you are aware of frauds like the one announced today, please contact us at 1-800-CALL-FBI.”
“Fraudsters who target the Federal health care system attempt to undermine the integrity of programs that serve millions of individuals.  When they leverage a public health emergency to perpetrate schemes, their wanton disregard for the programs and beneficiaries is glaringly clear,” stated HHS-OIG Special Agent-in-Charge Lampert.  “We are responding aggressively with our law enforcement partners to pursue bad actors and to warn the public about these ongoing scams.”
“The defendants allegedly carried out a $30 million health care fraud and money laundering scheme, siphoning funds meant for patients during the COVID-19 pandemic,” stated IRS-CI Special Agent-in-Charge Larsen. “While Americans across the country are in dire need of medical and financial assistance, the defendants allegedly used the stolen proceeds to purchase real estate and luxury items. IRS-CI and our law enforcement partners will continue to work tirelessly to expose COVID-19 schemes and bring those responsible to justice.”
“This indictment describes allegations of crimes that are especially egregious and caused significant harm to the programs designed to protect the most medically vulnerable, jeopardizing the health of our Medicare system and then using our nation’s financial system to launder proceeds of the fraud,” stated FDIC-OIG Special Agent-in-Charge Tarasca.  “We appreciate the cooperation of our fellow law enforcement partners as we work to identify and investigate fraud of this type.”
According to the indictment, the defendants used COVID-19 emergency override billing codes in order to submit fraudulent claims to Medicare, for which they were paid over $30 million for cancer medication Targretin Gel 1% including for claims where the medication never was purchased by the pharmacies, prescribed by physicians or dispensed to patients – often during periods when pharmacies were non-operational – and using doctors’ names on prescriptions without their permission.  The defendants allegedly acquired control over more than a dozen New York pharmacies by paying others to pose as the owners of the pharmacies and hiring pharmacists to pretend to be supervising pharmacists at the pharmacies for the purpose of obtaining pharmacy licenses.  Targretin Gel 1% has an average wholesale price of approximately $34,000 for each 60 gram tube.
The indictment also alleges that with the proceeds of the fraud, the defendants engaged in a money laundering conspiracy by creating sham pharmacy wholesale companies which they named after pre-existing pharmacy wholesalers, and fabricated references to invoices to make it appear that funds transferred from the pharmacies to the sham pharmacy wholesale companies were for legitimate pharmaceutical drug purchases.  In the first phase of this conspiracy, the defendants conspired with an international money launderer who arranged for funds to be wired from the sham pharmacy wholesale companies to companies in China for distribution to individuals in Uzbekistan.  In exchange, the defendants received cash from an unlicensed money transfer business, minus a commission that was deducted by the money launderer.  In the second phase of this conspiracy, when the fraudulent proceeds exceeded the amount of cash available, the defendants caused others to transfer funds back from the sham wholesale companies to the defendants, their relatives, or their designees, in the form of certified cashier’s checks and cash that was dropped off at their residences in the middle of the night.  The defendants used the proceeds of the scheme to purchase real estate and luxury items.
This case was investigated by HHS-OIG’s New York Field Office, the FBI’s New York Field Office, the IRS-CI’s New York Field Office and the FDIC.  It is being handled by the Medicare Fraud Strike Force under the supervision of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York and the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section.  Assistant Chief Jacob Foster of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section’s National Rapid Response Strike Force and Trial Attorney Andrew Estes of the Fraud Section’s Brooklyn Strike Force are in charge of the prosecution.  Former Fraud Section Trial Attorney Patrick Mott previously worked on the investigation.
The Fraud Section leads the Health Care Fraud Strike Force.  Since its inception in March 2007, the Health Care Fraud Strike Force, which maintains 15 strike forces operating in 24 districts, has charged more than 4,200 defendants who have collectively billed the Medicare program for nearly $19 billion.  In addition, the HHS Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, working in conjunction with the HHS-OIG, are taking steps to increase accountability and decrease the presence of fraudulent providers.

Former Louisville Investment Advisor Sentenced To 8 Years In Federal Prison
LOUISVILLE, Ky. – A former registered broker and financial advisor who defrauded multiple investors has been sentenced to 97 months, 3 years supervised release, and a SPA of $1,000 by U.S. District Senior Judge Charles R. Simpson III.
“Trust was the victim in this case; trust in the defendant who portrayed himself as a family member and stole millions, in our financial system, and in other human beings,” said U.S. Attorney Russell Coleman. “Thanks, however, to a diligent career prosecutor and solid work by the FBI, my hope is that our system of justice can help the victims regain some of that lost trust.”
Christopher Hibbard, 44, of Louisville, Kentucky, was initially indicted in November of 2018 with one count of investment fraud and nine counts of wire fraud. He pleaded guilty on June 30, 2020 to the charges.
According to a plea agreement, on or about February 9, 2007, and December 20, 2008, Hibbard made dozens of wire transfers from the brokerage account of a Louisville resident in the total amount of $1,226,995. Hibbard admitted to agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) that he had misappropriated and used a substantial portion of the client’s monies for his own personal use. After nearly exhausting the funds in the account, Hibbard presented the client with fraudulent brokerage statements that were used to lull the client into believing the account contained as much as $4 million.
In addition, between January 10, 2011, and December 20, 2017, Hibbard initiated over 300 unauthorized ACH transfers by wire in interstate commerce from client accounts under his management to an American Express account controlled by Hibbard. Hibbard caused the transfers to be made without the knowledge, permission, or other authorization of the account holder(s) thereby misappropriating and embezzling more than $3 million in client monies and using the funds for personal expenditures. In order to effectuate his scheme to defraud, the Defendant engaged in unauthorized trading and liquidation of clients' investments, made unauthorized withdrawals from client annuity accounts, and committed acts of forgery.
Hibbard was a broker registered with three different securities firms between 2004 and 2018.  Based upon his violation of securities laws, effective May 2018, the Financial Regulatory Authority suspended Hibbard permanently from associating with any FINRA member in any capacity.
The case was prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Marisa J. Ford. The investigation was conducted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).

Rochester Man Sentenced to Three Years in Prison for Fraud Scheme
SPRINGFIELD, Ill. – Senior U.S. District Judge Richard Mills sentenced Chase Brown, 21, of the 1000 block of Heathrow Lane, Rochester, Ill., to serve 37 months in federal prison for operating a sham medical equipment reseller business that defrauded businesses and individuals from various states. A hearing has been scheduled on Jan. 19, 2021, to determine the final restitution amount.
The court determined that Brown’s sentence be enhanced based on a finding that he engaged in ‘sophisticated means’ to carry out the scheme. Brown was held accountable for an intended loss of more than $750,000; however, the parties have agreed that for determining restitution, the actual loss and restitution amount is more than $300,000 but less than $750,000.
Brown pleaded guilty on July 24, 2020, to charges that he established a business known as Midwest Surgical, LLC, in May 2019, purportedly to purchase and resell medical equipment. Government evidence established that the business did not operate legitimately and was used to perpetuate the scheme.
At the sentencing hearing, on Dec. 16, 2020, Judge Mills cited the extent of the fraud that was perpetrated on multiple victims in multiple states, and noted that Brown committed the elaborate fraud while he was on probation for deceptive practice in Sangamon County. The government cited examples of Brown’s brazen fraud including stealing a friend’s credit card information and using credit card information from another victim to pay for a Jeep, a Springfield bar bill, payment to a Springfield car firm, and to purchase a second vehicle for a friend. Evidence was also presented that Brown defrauded a teenager of $14,000 he had saved from working jobs to purchase his first car.
Brown was arrested in Florida in March 2020, and has remained detained in the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service based upon the court’s prior finding that Brown presented a continued economic danger to the community.
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) Office of Inspector General and the Springfield Police Department conducted the investigation. Assistant U.S. Attorney Timothy A. Bass represented the government in the prosecution.

Former Bank President Sentenced For Embezzlement
LEXINGTON, Ky. – A former bank president, Thomas Hinkebein, 59, was sentenced to 12 months in federal prison, by Chief United States District Judge Danny C. Reeves, after previously pleading guilty to one count of embezzlement by a bank officer.
According to his plea agreement, Hinkebein admitted that, between January 12, 2016 and August 13, 2018, while he was the President of Whitaker Bank, he willfully misapplied assets of the bank.  Specifically, he admitted stealing golf carts and other property of Andover Country Club, an asset owned by Whitaker Bank, and seeking reimbursement from Whitaker Bank for a variety of personal expenses, including cell phone plans, gym memberships, fuel purchases, vehicle repairs, technology purchases for his family members, shipping expenses, and landscaping at his home.  To hide the personal nature of these expenses, the Defendant falsely reported many of the expenses to Whitaker Bank to make them appear to be legitimate work expenses.
Hinkebein pleaded guilty in September 2020.
In addition to the prison sentenced, Hinkebein will be required to pay a $5,500 fine and $50,739.56 in restitution owed.  Under federal law, Hinkebein must serve 85 percent of his prison sentence; and upon his release, he will be under the supervision of the U.S. Probation Office for three years.

Arkansas Project Manager Sentenced In Connection With COVID-Relief Fraud
A project manager employed by a major retailer was sentenced to 24 months in prison followed by five years of supervised release for fraudulently seeking more than $8 million in forgivable loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (SBA) under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act announced Acting Assistant Attorney General Brian C. Rabbitt of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division and U.S. Attorney R. Trent Shores of the Northern District of Oklahoma.
Benjamin Hayford, 32, of Centerton, Arkansas, was sentenced today by U.S. District Judge Claire V. Eagan.  Hayford pleaded guilty in August to an indictment charging him with fraudulently seeking millions of dollars in forgivable loans guaranteed by the SBA from multiple banks by claiming fictitious payroll expenses.  To support his applications, Hayford provided lenders with fraudulent payroll documentation purporting to establish payroll expenses that were, in fact, non-existent.  In addition, Hayford admitted to making false representations to a financial institution concerning the date that a Limited Liability Partnership for which he applied for relief was established.  The lenders at issue declined to fund the loans that Hayford sought.
“Small businesses are vital employers to 60 million Americans. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, many small businesses are treading water, and the Paycheck Protection Program is a lifeline to help keep employees on their payrolls,” said U.S. Attorney Trent Shores. “Benjamin Hayford, and those like him, seek to enrich themselves at the expense of others in need during these uncertain times.  Across the United States, these fraudsters are being brought to justice, including Hayford who will spend the next two years in federal prison.”
The CARES Act is a federal law enacted on March 29, 2020, designed to provide emergency financial assistance to the millions of Americans who are suffering the economic effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.  One source of relief provided by the CARES Act was the authorization of up to $349 billion in forgivable loans to small businesses for job retention and certain other expenses, through the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP).  In April 2020, Congress authorized over $300 billion in additional PPP funding.
The PPP allows qualifying small businesses and other organizations to receive loans with a maturity of two years and an interest rate of 1 percent. PPP loan proceeds must be used by businesses on payroll costs, interest on mortgages, rent, and utilities. The PPP allows the interest and principal to be forgiven if businesses spend the proceeds on these expenses within a set period and use a certain percentage of the loan towards payroll expenses.
Deputy Chief Brian R. Young of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Victor A.S. Régal for the Northern District of Oklahoma are prosecuting the case.  The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Arkansas provided valuable assistance in this matter.
The Justice Department acknowledges and thanks the Federal Housing Financial Agency Office of Inspector General, the SBA Office of Inspector General, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General for their efforts investigating this matter.

"U.S. Law Enforcement Takes Action Against Approximately 2,300 Money Mules In Global Crackdown On Money Laundering",https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/us-law-enforcement-takes-action-against-approximately-2300-money,"December 2, 2020",2020,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

U.S. Law Enforcement Takes Action Against Approximately 2,300 Money Mules In Global Crackdown On Money Laundering
Department of Justice and Partner Agencies Stop the Flow of Fraud Proceeds
The U.S. Department of Justice, the FBI, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, and six other federal law enforcement agencies announced the completion of the third annual Money Mule Initiative, a coordinated operation to disrupt the networks through which transnational fraudsters move the proceeds of their crimes.  Money mules are individuals who assist fraudsters by receiving money from victims of fraud and forwarding it to the fraud organizers, many of whom are located abroad.  Some money mules know they are assisting fraudsters, but others are unaware that their actions enable fraudsters’ efforts to swindle money from consumers, businesses, and government unemployment funds.  Europol announced a simultaneous effort, the European Money Mule Action (EMMA) today.
Over the last two months, U.S. law enforcement agencies took action against over 2,300 money mules, far surpassing last year’s effort , which acted against over 600 money mules.  This year, actions occurred in every state in the country.  The initiative announced today targeted money mules involved in a wide range of schemes including lottery fraud, romance scams, government imposter fraud, technical support fraud, business email compromise or CEO fraud, and unemployment insurance fraud.  Many of these schemes target elderly or vulnerable members of society.
“Money mules fuel fraud against some of America’s most vulnerable populations. Without the help of these money mules, many foreign fraud enterprises find it difficult to profit off of U.S. victims,” said Attorney General William P. Barr. “As this initiative demonstrates, the Department of Justice is committed to disrupting money mule networks, taking actions against more money mules this year than ever before, in an effort to cut off the flow of funds from American consumers and businesses to transnational criminal organizations.”
Eight federal law enforcement agencies participated in this year’s effort. Led by the Department of Justice’s Consumer Protection Branch, the FBI, and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, the participating agencies include the Department of Labor Office of Inspector General, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), Social Security Administration Office of Inspector General, U.S. Secret Service, and U.S. Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration.
Some highlights from this year’s efforts are:
Additionally, more than 35 individuals were criminally charged or arrested for their roles in receiving victim payments and forwarding the fraud proceeds to accomplices or laundering fraud proceeds. Cases include:
Additional criminal charges were brought by U.S. Attorney’s Offices in Southern District of Florida, Western District of Pennsylvania , Western District of North Carolina , Southern District of Texas, the Southern District of Mississippi , and the District of New Jersey .
The above charges are merely allegations, and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.
“The success of the Money Mule Initiative is the culmination of the hard work by and coordination between the FBI and our federal, state, local, and international partners,” said FBI Director Christopher Wray.  “This campaign has resulted in hundreds of criminal arrests worldwide and justice for countless victims.  Today’s announcement should send a clear message to those engaged in this type of criminal activity: they are not outside the reach of law enforcement, and the FBI and its partners will relentlessly pursue them in order to protect the American people.”
“The Postal Inspection Service has zero tolerance for fraudsters who use the U.S. Mail to transport funds from scammed victims,” said Chief Postal Inspector Gary Barksdale.  “Postal Inspectors use cutting-edge technology to build strong cases and campaigns like those announced today, which make significant progress towards disrupting money mule networks.  Postal Inspectors and our law enforcement partners will be relentless in the pursuit of criminal organizations that perpetrate these schemes.”
The agencies participating in the Money Mule Initiative and community partners are undertaking an outreach campaign to increase awareness of how fraudsters use and recruit money mules. U.S. Attorney’s Offices across the country, through their Elder Justice Coordinators, will be reaching out to their communities to educate the public about money mules.  AmeriCorp Seniors (formerly Senior Corps) will be working to increase awareness of how money mules facilitate fraud and how consumers can avoid unwittingly assisting fraud schemes.
Additionally, the American Bankers Association will be engaging with its members on money mules and the role of financial institutions in addressing the problem.  The Department of Justice will also be distributing resources for state and local law enforcement on identifying, disrupting, investigating, and prosecuting money mules.
To find public education materials, as well as information about how fraudsters use and recruit money mules, please visit www.justice.gov/civil/consumer-protection-branch/money-mule-initiative .
Since President Trump signed the bipartisan Elder Abuse Prevention and Prosecution Act (EAPPA) into law, the Department of Justice has participated in hundreds of enforcement actions in criminal and civil cases that targeted or disproportionately affected seniors.  In January 2020, the department designated “Preventing and Disrupting Transnational Elder Fraud” as an Agency Priority Goal, one of its top four priorities.  In March 2020, the department announced the largest elder fraud enforcement action in American history, charging more than 400 defendants in a nationwide elder fraud sweep.  The department has also conducted hundreds of trainings and outreach sessions across the country since the passage of the Act.
The department’s extensive efforts to combat elder fraud seek to halt the billions of dollars seniors lose each year to fraud schemes, including those perpetrated by transnational criminal organizations.  The best method for prevention, however, is sharing information about the various types of elder fraud schemes with relatives, friends, neighbors, and other seniors who can use that information to protect themselves.
If you or someone you know is age 60 or older and has been a victim of financial fraud, help is standing by at the National Elder Fraud Hotline: 1-833-FRAUD-11 (1-833-372-8311).  This U.S. Department of Justice hotline, managed by the Office for Victims of Crime, is staffed by experienced professionals who provide personalized support to callers by assessing the needs of the victim, and identifying relevant next steps.  Case managers will identify appropriate reporting agencies, provide information to callers to assist them in reporting, connect callers directly with appropriate agencies, and provide resources and referrals, on a case-by-case basis.  Reporting is the first step.  Reporting can help authorities identify those who commit fraud and reporting certain financial losses due to fraud as soon as possible can increase the likelihood of recovering losses.  The hotline is staffed seven days a week from 6:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. eastern time. English, Spanish and other languages are available.

North Suburban Man Sentenced to a Year in Federal Prison for Illegal Sports Bookmaking and Tax Offenses
CHICAGO — A north suburban man was sentenced today to a year in federal prison for operating an illegal sports bookmaking business and filing false income tax returns.
DOMENIC POETA, 63, of Highland Park, unlawfully operated a business that provided sports betting and wagering services, both domestically and abroad.  From 2012 to 2017, Poeta obtained more than $3.7 million from the operation of his bookmaking business.  Poeta failed to report his receipt of this income in the federal and state tax returns that he filed for each of those years, resulting in a federal and state tax loss of approximately $1,486,363.
Poeta pleaded guilty earlier this year to one count of transmission of wagering information and one count of filing a false tax return.  U.S. District Judge Matthew F. Kennelly imposed the sentence in federal court in Chicago.
The sentence was announced by John R. Lausch, Jr., United States Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois; Tamera Cantu, Acting Special Agent-in-Charge of the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation Division in Chicago; and John Crawford, Special Agent-in-Charge of the Chicago Regional Office of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of Inspector General.  The government is represented by Assistant U.S. Attorney Patrick King.

Macomb Township Resident Pleads Guilty In COVID-19 Bank Fraud Scheme
A Macomb Township resident pleaded guilty today to a scheme to fraudulently obtain approximately $931,000 from the Paycheck Protection Program, United States Attorney Matthew Schneider announced today.
Joining Schneider in the announcement were Special Agent in Charge John Crawford of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General, Special Agent in Charge Douglas Zloto of the United States Secret Service, and Special Agent in Charge Sharon Johnson of the United States Small Business Administration Office of Inspector General.
Michael Bischoff, 60, of Macomb Township, Michigan, pleaded guilty to one count of bank fraud arising from his effort to obtain some $931,000 by defrauding several financial institutions regarding loans from the Paycheck Protection Program.
According to the plea documents, Bischoff owned a number of pizza restaurants in Macomb County, Michigan, which operated through various corporate entities he controlled (the Bischoff entities). The plea documents further state that Bischoff applied for at least nine loans on behalf of the Bischoff entities under the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). The PPP is a program overseen by the Small Business Administration designed to provide forgivable loans to small businesses affected by the coronavirus pandemic. Applicants for PPP loans apply directly to banks or financial institutions participating in the program; in those applications, applicants make affirmative certifications about, among other things, their average monthly payroll expenses and number of employees. Applicants also certify their intent to spend PPP proceeds on permissible business expenses, such as payroll costs, rent, utilities, and interest on mortgages. PPP loans may be entirely forgiven if the recipient spends the loan proceeds on these permissible expenses within a designated period of time after receiving the proceeds.
According to the plea documents, at least nine of Bischoff’s PPP applications contained false and fraudulent representations to the participating lenders. All of the applications included false representations about the amount of payroll and number of employees working at the Bischoff entities. A number of the applications also included false documentation, purportedly from the IRS, to support the misrepresentations about payroll expenses at those entities. In other applications, Bischoff fraudulently used another person’s personal identifying information to secure approval for the loans.
In all, Bischoff sought approximately $931,772 in proceeds from the PPP. Bischoff actually received approximately $593,590 from PPP lenders as a result of his fraudulent loan applications.
“The pandemic has had a major economic impact on our community, and the Paycheck Protection Program is a critical lifeline for Michigan’s small businesses during this challenging time,” stated United States Attorney Schneider. “Fraud in this program takes dollars away from needy businesses and puts them into the hands of crooks and thieves.  This is a serious crime, and my office is committed to finding anyone guilty of defrauding this program and prosecuting them quickly and aggressively.”
“Agents from the FDIC, SBA and US Secret Service - Detroit Field Office partnered together with the United States Attorney’s Office to investigate a local business owner, who took advantage of the global pandemic to enrich himself with COVID Relief disaster funds,” stated SAC Zloto. “Mr. Bischoff engaged is multiple instances of Payroll Protection Plan loan fraud, which was intended to help honest business owners weather these troubled times.”
A sentencing date has been set for March 22, 2021 at 2:30pm before United States District Judge Paul D. Borman.
The case is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney John K. Neal of the Eastern District of Michigan, Trial Attorney Philip B. Trout of the U.S. Department of Justice’s Criminal Division, Fraud Section, and Trial Attorney Chad M. Davis of the U.S. Department of Justice’s Criminal Division, Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section. The investigation is being conducted jointly by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General, the United States Secret Service and the Small Business Administration Office of Inspector General.

Warren County Businessman Arrested for Fraudulently Obtaining Nearly $2 Million in Loans Meant to Help Small Businesses During COVID-19 Pandemic
NEWARK, N.J. – A Warren County, New Jersey, businessman who fraudulently obtained nearly $2 million in federal Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans will make his initial court appearance today, U.S. Attorney Craig Carpenito and Acting Assistant Attorney General Brian C. Rabbitt of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division announced.
Rocco A. Malanga, 48, of Hackettstown, New Jersey, is charged by criminal complaint with one count of wire fraud, two counts of bank fraud, and one count of money laundering. He made his initial appearance by videoconference today before U.S. Magistrate Judge Joseph A. Dickson and was released on $750,000 unsecured bond.
According to documents filed in this case and statements made in court:
Malanga used a variety of false statements to fraudulently obtain approximately $1.8 million in federal COVID-19 emergency relief funds meant for distressed small businesses.  Malanga submitted at least three PPP loan applications on behalf of three different business entities that fabricated their number of employees and average monthly payroll. He then diverted the PPP loan funds to accounts under the control of his relatives, including his minor children, and to another company that did not obtain a PPP loan.
In one instance, Malanga submitted a PPP loan application on behalf of one of his companies that had supporting documentation that claimed that the company had 47 employees, a monthly payroll of $324,081, and paid employees approximately $3.9 million in total compensation for 2019. Contrary to this documentation and these representations, IRS records showed that the company paid no salaries or wages in 2019.
Based on Malanga’s alleged misrepresentations, the three PPP loans were funded. As a result, Malanga received a total of nearly $1.8 million in federal COVID-19 emergency relief funds meant for distressed small businesses.
The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act is a federal law enacted March 29, 2020. It is designed to provide emergency financial assistance to millions of Americans who are suffering the economic effects resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. One source of relief provided by the CARES Act is the authorization of up to $349 billion in forgivable loans to small businesses for job retention and certain other expenses through the PPP. In April 2020, Congress authorized over $300 billion in additional PPP funding.
The PPP allows qualifying small businesses and other organizations to receive loans with a maturity of two years and an interest rate of 1 percent. Businesses must use PPP loan proceeds for payroll costs, interest on mortgages, rent and utilities. The PPP allows the interest and principal to be forgiven if businesses spend the proceeds on these expenses within a set time period and use at least a certain percentage of the loan towards payroll expenses.
The count of wire fraud carries a maximum penalty of 30 years in prison and a $1 million fine; the two counts of bank fraud carry a maximum penalty of 30 years in prison and a $1 million fine; and the count of money laundering carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a $250,000.
U.S. Attorney Carpenito and Acting Assistant Attorney General Rabbitt credited inspectors of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, under the direction of Acting Inspector in Charge Raimundo Marrero; and special agents of IRS – Criminal Investigation, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Michael Montanez, with the investigation leading to the charges. They also thanked the Federal Reserve Bank, Office of Inspector General; the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of Inspector General; and the Social Security Administration, Office of the Inspector General.
The government is represented by Assistant U.S. Attorney Blake Coppotelli of the District of New Jersey and Trial Attorney Della Sentilles of the Fraud Section of the Department of Justice.
Anyone with information about allegations of attempted fraud involving COVID-19 can report it by calling the Department of Justice’s National Center for Disaster Fraud Hotline at 866-720-5721 or via the NCDF Web Complaint Form at: https://www.justice.gov/disaster-fraud/ncdf-disaster-complaint-form .

Seven Charged in Connection with a COVID-Relief Fraud Scheme Involving more than 80 Fraudulent Loan Applications Worth Approximately $16 Million
Seven individuals across two states were charged in an indictment unsealed today for their alleged participation in a scheme to obtain approximately $16 million in forgivable Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (SBA) under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.
Amir Aqeel, 52, and Pardeep Basra, 51, both of Houston, Texas; Rifat Bajwa, 51, of Richmond, Texas; Mayer Misak, 40, of Cypress, Texas; Mauricio Navia, 41, of Katy, Texas; and Richard Reuth, 57, of Spring, Texas, are expected to make their initial appearances today before U.S. Magistrate Judge Andrew M. Edison.
They are all charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and wire fraud.  The indictment also charges Aqeel with three counts of money laundering.
Also named in the Houston indictment is Siddiq Azeemuddin, 41, of Naperville, Illinois.  He also faces charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud and money laundering.  Azeemuddin will appear today before U.S. Magistrate Judge Heather K. McShain of the Northern District of Illinois.
“These defendants allegedly participated in a scheme to capitalize on the pandemic by filing at least 80 fraudulent PPP applications and enriching themselves by $16 million, spending it on luxury items such as a Porsche and Lamborghini automobiles,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Brian C. Rabbitt of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division.  “The department and our law enforcement partners will continue to aggressively pursue those who would seek to illegally exploit the ongoing national emergency for their own benefit.”
“Some fraudsters create the most complicated schemes to steal money from the taxpayer.  Just imagine how productive they could be if they put their creativity and effort into noble and useful work,” said U.S. Attorney Ryan K. Patrick of the Southern District of Texas.  “With the great work of so many partner agencies, we will bring to justice those who steal from the treasury.”
“Greed has no place in SBA’s programs that are intended to provide assistance to the nation’s small businesses struggling with the pandemic challenges,” said Special Agent in Charge Sharon Johnson of the SBA Office of Inspector General (OIG) Central Region.  “OIG and its law enforcement partners will relentlessly pursue fraudsters and bring them to justice.  I want to thank the U.S. Attorney’s Office and our law enforcement partners for their dedication and pursuit of justice.”
“These defendants are alleged to have defrauded a program intended to assist hardworking Americans who have been unfairly impacted as a result of this unprecedented and challenging health crisis,” said Special Agent in Charge Mark B. Dawson of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Houston.  “HSI remains committed to working with our law enforcement partners to bring every asset to bear against anyone who seeks to take advantage of the pandemic to deliberately harm and deceive others for their own profit.”
“To support small and community banks, Federal Home Loan Banks can accept Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans as collateral when making loans to their members,” said Special Agent in Charge Catherine Huber of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) OIG, Central Region. “The Office of Inspector General is proud to work with our partners in law enforcement to prevent, detect, and deter attempts to perpetrate fraud in the Federal Home Loan Bank System and steal the assistance intended for small business owners and employees under this important part of the CARES Act.”
“Today’s indictment describes significant abuse of public funds meant for struggling American businesses and families,” said Special Agent in Charge Laurie L. Younger of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) OIG.  “This alleged fraud represents substantial, egregious, and coordinated actions that undermine faith in our financial systems and programs enacted by Congress to help our nation recover from economic damage brought on by COVID-19.  We thank our law enforcement partners for their cooperation in this investigation.”
“The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration aggressively pursues those who endeavor to defraud programs afforded to the American people under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act,” said J. Russell George, Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA).  “We appreciate the efforts of the U.S. Department Justice and our law enforcement partners in this effort.”
The indictment alleges all conspired to submit more than 80 fraudulent PPP loan applications by falsifying the number of employees and the average monthly payroll expenses of the applicant businesses. In support of these fraudulent loan applications, they conspired to submit, and did submit, fraudulent bank records and/or fake federal tax forms, according to the charges.  Some of the PPP loan applications were allegedly submitted on behalf of companies the defendants controlled.
Other loan applications were submitted on behalf of entities that third-parties allegedly owned, according to the indictment.  In exchange for these, several of the defendants received large kickbacks, according to the charges.
The indictment further alleges the defendants laundered a portion of the fraudulent proceeds by writing checks from companies that received PPP loans to fake employees.  Those that received checks included some of the defendants and their relatives, according to the charges.  The fake paychecks were then allegedly cashed at Fascare International Inc. dba Almeda Discount Store – a cash checking company Azeemuddin owned.
The indictment alleges that over 1,100 fake paychecks totaling more than $3 million in fraudulent PPP loan proceeds were cashed at Azeemuddin’s business.
Federal agents also executed 45 seizure warrants in conjunction with the case.  Some of items seized included a Porsche and a Lamborghini allegedly purchased with illegally obtained funds.
This is an ongoing investigation.  If the public has further information regarding this fraud, please contact the Department of Homeland Security at 1-866-DHS-2-ICE .
The CARES Act is a federal law enacted on March 29, 2020, designed to provide emergency financial assistance to the millions of Americans who are suffering the economic effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.  One source of relief provided by the CARES Act was the authorization of up to $349 billion in forgivable loans to small businesses for job retention and certain other expenses, through the PPP.  In April 2020, Congress authorized over $300 billion in additional PPP funding.
The PPP allows qualifying small-businesses and other organizations to receive loans with a maturity of two years and an interest rate of one percent.  PPP loan proceeds must be used by businesses on payroll costs, interest on mortgages, rent, and utilities.  The PPP allows the interest and principal on the PPP loan to be forgiven if the business spends the loan proceeds on these expense items within a designated period of time after receiving the proceeds and uses at least a certain percentage of the PPP loan proceeds on payroll expenses.
A federal criminal indictment is merely an accusation.  A defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.
This case was investigated by the SBA-OIG; HSI; FHFA-OIG; FDIC-OIG and TIGTA.  Trial Attorneys Louis Manzo and Della Sentilles of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Rodolfo Ramirez and Kristine Rollinson for the Southern District of Texas are prosecuting the case.

Former CEO Of Crown Bank Sentenced To Prison For Fraud And Tax Offenses,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/former-ceo-crown-bank-sentenced-prison-fraud-and-tax-offenses,"November 16, 2020",2020,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Former CEO Of Crown Bank Sentenced To Prison For Fraud And Tax Offenses
United States Attorney Erica H. MacDonald today announced the sentencing of PETER EARL DAHL, 54, to a year and a day in prison for wire fraud and filing a false income tax return. DAHL, who pleaded guilty on July 20, 2020, was sentenced on November 16, 2020 before Senior U.S. District Judge Susan Richard Nelson in St. Paul, Minnesota.
According to his guilty plea and documents filed in court, while President and CEO of Minneapolis-based Crown Bank (“Crown”) from 2015 to 2017, DAHL engaged in a scheme to defraud the bank and several individuals. DAHL conducted transactions involving funds and credits of Crown for his own purposes and without permission of the bank’s board or shareholders and without notice to or approval of state and federal regulatory agencies.  DAHL used various Crown accounts to cover his personal debts and expenditures and repeatedly kited obligations within accounts of Crown and between accounts at Crown and other banks. In connection with many such transactions, DAHL understood that records would be created at Crown. On many occasions DAHL made and caused to be made false entries in Crown’s records, either because records were created in accounts that did not legitimately belong to DAHL, or because a false entry had to be made in a record to cause funds to be released for the benefit of DAHL.
According to his guilty plea and documents filed in court, DAHL also defrauded prospective investors in Crown Bank’s holding company, Crown Bankshares. To entice investors to buy shares, DAHL made misrepresentations of material fact and concealed material facts from investors. For example, in March 2017 and later, DAHL represented to prospective investors that a merger with or acquisition by another bank was “imminent,” and that he was negotiating for the other bank to purchase Crown. DAHL specified a per-share premium of 25 percent to be received by investors and that he would remain with the surviving entity in a controlling management capacity. In reality, no merger was likely.
According to his guilty plea and documents filed in court, during this same period, DAHL knew that he was under scrutiny by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”). DAHL did not disclose this material information when telling investors that he would remain in his position within the new entity. Prospective investors paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to purchase bank stock based on the misrepresentations.
According to his guilty plea and documents filed in court, another aspect of the fraud involved DAHL arranging loans from individuals which were falsely described as loans to third parties, but with the funds actually going to DAHL. DAHL forged the signatures of at least two bank customers to obtain such loans for his personal use. DAHL also failed to disclose on his 2016 federal tax return the income obtained from the transactions, resulting in a loss to the IRS of more than $250,000.
As part of the case, DAHL was ordered to pay restitution and to forfeit $40,000 he had paid to the United States Marshals Service ostensibly to purchase Crown Bankshares stock that had been seized in the prosecution of Tom Petters.
This case is the result of an investigation conducted by the FBI, IRS – Criminal Investigation, the Office of Inspector General for the Federal Reserve Board, and the Office of Inspector General for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
This case was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert Lewis.

Local Basketball Coach Charged in Federal Court with Defrauding Covid-19 Relief Program out of Almost $1 Million
Miami, Fl. -- A Florida man, recently named one of Florida’s high school basketball coaches of the year, was arrested and charged with fraudulently obtaining $984,710 in a Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan.
U.S. Attorney Ariana Fajardo Orshan of the Southern District of Florida, Special Agent in Charge Kyle A. Myles of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) Office of Inspector General (OIG), and Special Agent in Charge George L. Piro of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) made the announcement.
Terrence Deshun Williams, 40, of Tamarac, Florida, was charged by criminal complaint in the Southern District of Florida with one count of bank fraud, one count of money laundering, one count of engaging in transactions in unlawful proceeds, and one count of making false statements to a financial institution.
The complaint alleges that Williams, the head coach of the boys’ varsity basketball team at a Fort Lauderdale high school, applied for and received $984,710 in a PPP loan from an insured financial institution on behalf of Williams Consulting Group LLC, a company Williams owned.  The complaint alleges that although Williams claimed the company had 67 employees and an average monthly payroll of $393,884.00, the company in fact paid no such payroll and did not have any recorded employees with the State of Florida.  The complaint alleges that after receiving the loan proceeds, instead of using the money for an approved purpose, Williams laundered the vast majority by transferring the proceeds to several accounts he controlled at a different financial institution.  The complaint also alleges that Williams received into his company’s bank account Florida Unemployment Insurance benefits.
Williams is scheduled for an initial appearance today at 11:00 a.m. before U.S. Magistrate Judge Lurana Snow, who sits in Ft. Lauderdale.

Macomb Township Resident Charged In COVID-19 Bank Fraud Scheme
A Macomb Township resident was charged in a Criminal Information for his alleged role in a scheme to fraudulently obtain approximately $931,000 from the Paycheck Protection Program, United States Attorney Matthew Schneider announced today.
Joining Schneider in the announcement were Special Agent in Charge John Crawford of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General, Special Agent in Charge Douglas Zlotto of the United States Secret Service, and Special Agent in Charge Sharon Johnson of the United States Small Business Administration Office of Inspector General.
The Information charges Michael Bischoff, 60, of Macomb Township, Michigan, with one count of Bank Fraud.
According to the Information, Bischoff owned a number of pizza restaurants in Macomb County, Michigan, which operated through various corporate entities Bischoff controlled (the Bischoff entities). The Information alleges that Bischoff applied for at least nine loans on behalf of the Bischoff entities under the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). The PPP is a program overseen by the Small Business Administration designed to provide forgivable loans to small businesses affected by the coronavirus pandemic. Applicants for PPP loans apply directly to banks or financial institutions participating in the program; in those applications, applicants make affirmative certifications about, among other things, their average monthly payroll expenses and number of employees. Applicants also certify their intent to spend PPP proceeds on permissible business expenses, such as payroll costs, rent, utilities, and interest on mortgages. PPP loans may be entirely forgiven if the recipient spends the loan proceeds on these permissible expenses within a designated period of time after receiving the proceeds.
The Information alleges that at least nine of Bischoff’s PPP applications contained false and fraudulent representations to the participating lenders. All of the applications included false representations about the amount of payroll and number of employees working at the Bischoff entities. A number of the applications also included false documentation, purportedly from the IRS, to support the misrepresentations about payroll expenses at those entities. In other applications, Bischoff is alleged to have fraudulently used another person’s personal identifying information to secure approval for the loans.
In all, the Information alleges that, in his false and fraudulent loan applications,  Bischoff sought approximately $931,772 in proceeds from the PPP. Bischoff is alleged to have actually received approximately $593,590 from PPP lenders as a result of his fraudulent loan applications.
An Information is only a charge and is not evidence of guilt.
The case is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney John K. Neal of the Eastern District of Michigan, Trial Attorney Philip B. Trout of the U.S. Department of Justice’s Criminal Division, Fraud Section, and Trial Attorney Chad M. Davis of the U.S. Department of Justice’s Criminal Division, Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section. The investigation is being conducted jointly by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General, the United States Secret Service and the Small Business Administration Office of Inspector General.

Former Bank Executive Sentenced to Prison for $15 Million Construction Loan Fraud
A former Kansas bank executive was sentenced to 60 months in prison today for his role in carrying out a bank fraud scheme to obtain a $15 million construction loan from 26 Kansas banks.
Acting Assistant Attorney General Brian Rabbitt of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, Special Agent in Charge Justin Bundy of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General’s (FDIC-OIG) Kansas City Regional Office, Special Agent in Charge Adam B. Steiner of the IRS Criminal Investigation’s (IRS-CI) St. Louis Field Office, Special Agent in Charge Timothy Langan of the FBI’s Kansas City Field Office, and Special Agent in Charge Catherine Huber of the Federal Housing Finance Agency Office of Inspector General’s (FHFA-OIG) Central Region Office made the announcement.
Troy A. Gregory, 53, of Lawrence, Kansas, was sentenced by Chief U.S. District Judge Julie A. Robinson of the District of Kansas to 60 months in prison followed by three years of supervised release, and ordered to pay $4,731,208.16 in restitution.
Following a two-week trial in August 2019, Gregory was found guilty of four counts of bank fraud and two counts of false statements.  According to the evidence presented at trial and at the sentencing hearing, Gregory was a bank executive and loan officer who had made millions of dollars in loans to a group of borrowers who were struggling to make payments on the loans.  Beginning in late 2007, Gregory initiated the process of making a $15.2 million construction loan to build an apartment complex to that same group of borrowers so they could pay back the other outstanding loans.  Gregory’s bank shared this loan with 25 other Kansas banks.  To convince the other banks to participate, Gregory made and caused others to make false statements about the strength of the borrowers, the debt status of the apartment property and the existence of approximately $1.7 million in certificates of deposit for collateral on the loan, all to get the loan approved.
Instead of using the loan funds promised for building the apartments, Gregory immediately diverted over $1 million of the loan to pay for part of the certificates of deposit pledged as collateral, pay off debt on the apartment property and make payments on unrelated loans.  Other Kansas banks that shared in this loan would not have participated in the loan without Gregory’s false representations and promises.  The victimized banks collectively lost approximately $5 million on this fraudulent loan.
The case was investigated by FDIC-OIG, IRS-CI, the FBI, and FHFA-OIG.  Senior Litigation Counsel David A. Bybee and Trial Attorney Andrew R. Tyler of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section prosecuted the case.
The Criminal Division’s Fraud Section plays a pivotal role in the Department of Justice’s fight against white collar crime around the country.

Boulder Man Sentenced To 5 Years In Federal Prison For Nearly $32 Million Bank Fraud Scheme
Michael Scott Leslie engaged in identity theft to obtain funds for fraudulent mortgages
DENVER – United States Attorney Jason R. Dunn announced that Michael Scott Leslie, age 57, of Boulder, Colorado, was sentenced to serve 5 years (60 months) in federal prison for bank fraud and aggravated identity theft, followed by 5 years of supervised release.  Leslie was ordered to report to a Bureau of Prisons facility on January 4, 2021.  The Denver office of the FBI, and the Offices of the Inspector General for both the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) joined in announcement.
According to the stipulated facts contained in Leslie’s plea agreement, Leslie owned, operated, or otherwise had an interest in several business entities, some of which were operated out of Colorado.  These entities were involved in or affiliated with financing or originating residential mortgage loans.  Through these business entities, Leslie sold residential mortgage loans to investors, including an FDIC-insured bank in Texas (“the victim bank”).
Between October 2015 and October 2017, Leslie devised and executed a scheme to defraud the victim bank by selling it 144 fraudulent residential mortgage loans valued at $31,908,806.88.  These loans were purportedly originated by one of Leslie’s companies, Montage Mortgage, and “closed”  by Snowberry, which earned fees for the closing.  The loans were then presented and sold to the victim bank until Montage identified a final investor.  For these 144 fraudulent loans, that final investor was Mortgage Capital Management (MCM).
Leslie never disclosed to the victim bank that he operated MCM and Snowberry, or the fact that sales to investor MCM, even if they had been real, were not arms-length transactions.
The 144 residential mortgage loans sold to the victim bank were not, in fact, real loans.  The borrowers listed on these 144 fraudulent loans were real individuals, but they had no idea that their identities had been used as part of the sale of the fraudulent loans. The defendant had access to their personal identifying information in one of two primary ways:  (1) the borrowers had used Montage for legitimate residential real estate transactions which were properly executed and closed, or (2) the borrowers had been solicited by Montage about refinancing their existing loans.  In the case of refinance transactions, Montage secured permission from the borrowers to request credit scores and history from the major credit agencies.  After receipt of those credit scores, Montage often told these would-be refinance borrowers that they did not qualify for a refinance.  Leslie then recycled the borrowers’ information, obtained through prior legitimate transactions or attempted refinances, to create and sell nearly $32 million of fraudulent loan packages.
To execute this scheme, Leslie forged signatures on closing documents and fabricated and altered credit reports as well as title documents, often by using the names of legitimate companies.  The fraudulent real estate transactions were never filed with the respective counties in which the properties were located, there were no closings, and no liens were ever recorded.  Through numerous bank accounts for the various business entities and his personal accounts, the defendant used money in a Ponzi-like fashion from prior fraudulent loans sold to the victim bank to fund future fraudulent loans.  This complex flow of money continued until the defendant’s fraud was detected.  When the fraud was discovered, the victim bank still had 12 fraudulent loans, valued at $3,887,505.93, on its books that it could not, given that the loans did not exist, sell to any other legitimate third-party investor.
“Five years in federal prison is an appropriate sentence for a fraudster that stole personal identities and used them to steal millions of dollars from a legitimate business,” said U.S. Attorney Jason Dunn.  “Thanks to the hard work of the investigating agencies and the prosecution team in my office, not only will Mr. Leslie have several years in prison to contemplate his actions, but other such criminals are on notice that we take economic crime seriously and will prosecute them to the full extent of the law.”
“This sentencing of Michael Scott Leslie sends a clear message the FBI and our partners will relentlessly pursue those who defraud financial institutions for personal gain,” said FBI Denver Special Agent in Charge Michael Schneider. “FBI Denver extends its appreciation to OIG-HUD, FDIC, and the U.S. Attorney's Office- District of Colorado for their invaluable assistance in this investigation and prosecution.”
“HUD-OIG is committed to pursuing those who would abuse HUD programs,” said Scott Tanchak, Special Agent in Charge with the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Office of Inspector General.  “HUD-OIG will aggressively pursue mortgage fraud, especially when facilitated by persons in the mortgage industry.  In partnership with other law enforcement and federal agencies, we are deeply committed to ensuring that corrupt individuals do not use HUD programs to enrich themselves.”
“The FDIC OIG, along with its law enforcement partners, is dedicated to pursuing those who commit schemes to defraud the nation’s federally insured financial institutions,” stated FDIC OIG Special Agent in Charge Younger.
Chief U.S. District Court Judge Philip A. Brimmer pronounced the sentence on November 6, 2020.  Leslie pleaded guilty on July 31, 2020, and was first charged by information on June 5, 2020.  This case was investigated by the Denver office of the FBI, and the Offices of the Inspector General for both the Housing and Urban Development and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.  The defendant was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Hetal J. Doshi and Jeremy Sibert.

Former President and CEO of Cecil Bank Sentenced in Maryland to Two Years in Federal Prison for a Bank Fraud Conspiracy, Receiving a Bribe, and Making False Statements in Bank Records
Orchestrated the Straw Purchase of a Foreclosed Property for Her Own Benefit, Causing a Loss to the Bank of Approximately $145,000; Made False Statements to Bank Regulators Inquiring About Foreclosed Property
Baltimore, Maryland – U.S. District Judge Deborah K. Chasanow today sentenced the former President and Chief Executive Officer of Cecil Bank, Mary Beyer Halsey, age 59, of Rising Sun, Maryland, to two years in federal prison, followed by five years of supervised release.  Halsey pleaded guilty on July 31, 2020, to the federal charges of conspiracy to commit bank fraud, receipt of a bribe by a bank official, and false statement in bank records, in connection with the straw purchase of a home in Rising Sun, Maryland, upon which Cecil Bank had foreclosed.  Judge Chasanow also ordered Halsey to forfeit her interest in the home in Rising Sun and to pay restitution in the amount of $145,000.
The sentence was announced by United States Attorney for the District of Maryland Robert K. Hur; Special Agent in Charge Mark P. Higgins of Federal Housing Finance Agency, Office of Inspector General (FHFA-OIG), Mid-Atlantic Region; Special Agent in Charge Patricia Tarasca of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of Inspector General (FDIC/OIG), New York Region; Special Inspector General Christy Goldsmith Romero for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (SIGTARP); and Inspector General Hannibal “Mike” Ware of the Small Business Administration, Office of Inspector General (SBA/OIG).
“Mary Beyer Halsey will now serve time in federal prison after she used her position as President and CEO of Cecil Bank for her personal benefit, causing a loss to the bank, which had already received federal taxpayer funds as part of the Troubled Asset Relief Program,” said U.S. Attorney Robert K. Hur.  “Corrupt bank officials undermine the public’s trust in our financial system.”
“The Federal Housing Finance Agency Office of Inspector General (FHFA-OIG) is committed to investigating allegations of fraud committed by officers of financial institutions which are members of the 11 Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBanks) because their crimes strike at the heart of the FHLBank System,” said Mark Higgins, Special Agent in Charge of the FHFA-OIG’s Mid-Atlantic Region. “We are proud to have partnered with the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Maryland and our law enforcement partners on this case.”
“Today the former CEO of Cecil Bank was sentenced to prison, becoming the 78th banker sentenced to prison resulting from a SIGTARP investigation,” said Special Inspector General Christy Goldsmith Romero. “Treasury wrote off $11 million from its TARP investment in Cecil Bank.  We commend U.S. Attorney Hur and his team of prosecutors in standing with SIGTARP to combat fraud that hurt banks during critical times.”
Cecil Bank, located in Elkton, Maryland, had received $11,560,000 in federal taxpayer funds in 2008, under the Capital Purchase Program, as part of the Troubled Asset Relief Program.  On April 20, 2011, Cecil Bank initiated the foreclosure of a single-family house located at 127 Ebenezer Church Road in Rising Sun.
According to her plea agreement, from 2012 to 2013, Halsey conspired with Daniel Whitehurst, an employee of a real estate development company that did business in Maryland, to defraud Cecil Bank and another bank to purchase a home through false pretenses, representations and promises.  Specifically, on March 28, 2012, Halsey and Whitehurst met at a restaurant in Cecil County.  Whitehurst asked Halsey if she could help him and a business partner get a $500,000 line of credit from Cecil Bank.  Halsey agreed to help Whitehurst to obtain a line of credit from Cecil Bank, in exchange for Whitehurst agreeing to serve as the straw purchaser of 127 Ebenezer on behalf of Halsey.  Halsey suggested that she increase the line of credit for Whitehurst to $650,000 to include the funds needed to buy the house.  Whitehurst agreed to Halsey’s request to secretly buy 127 Ebenezer on Halsey’s behalf.  On May 9, 2012, Halsey participated in a loan committee meeting at Cecil Bank that considered and approved a $650,000 line for credit for Whitehurst and a $500,000 line of credit for his business partner.
Halsey admitted that at her request, on May 14, 2012, Whitehurst visited 127 Ebenezer and provided Halsey with an estimate of the costs to update the house.  Whitehurst determined that beyond replacing the kitchen subflooring at a cost of about $1,000, there were no significant repairs needed.  Whitehurst provided a letter of intent to purchase the home from the bank for $150,000 for Halsey to review.  Halsey suggested lowering the price to $145,000 to allow room to increase the offer later.  Halsey knew that an exterior-only appraisal of the property ordered by Cecil Bank on November 9, 2011, showed a market value of $263,000.  A full appraisal on September 10, 2012, reflected a market value of $295,000.  To support the below-market price that Halsey wanted to pay, Whitehurst included in the letter of intent a list of lower-priced home sales in the same area that were not comparable to 127 Ebenezer and therefore was not reflective of the property’s actual market value.
As detailed in the plea agreement, on May 23, 2012, Whitehurst e-mailed Cecil Bank his offer to purchase 127 Ebenezer for $145,000.  On the same day, during a meeting of the Cecil Bank Board of Directors, Halsey advised the Board that Whitehurst had made a purchase offer of $140,000 for 127 Ebenezer, $5,000 less the actual offer.  To support the below-market price of $140,000, Halsey falsely characterized the property as having “structural deficiencies [that] will require significant repairs.”  Halsey did not disclose her personal interest in the property, nor Whitehurst’s role as her nominee to acquire the property on her behalf.  The Board authorized Halsey to “negotiate the best price.”  Thereafter, Whitehurst submitted a contract for him to purchase 127 Ebenezer from Cecil Bank for $150,000, which Halsey signed on August 17, 2012 on behalf of Cecil Bank.
According to the plea agreement, subsequent to authorizing the sale of 127 Ebenezer, Halsey told Whitehurst that he should not use his line of credit from Cecil Bank to purchase the house, but should instead get the funds from a different source.  Whitehurst applied for and obtained a $100,000 loan from another bank to purchase 127 Ebenezer, fraudulently claiming that he was purchasing the property for himself and that the down payment was from an investment account.  On October 31, 2012, prior to 127 Ebenezer going to settlement, Halsey wired $75,000 to Whitehurst’s bank account to cover the cost of the down payment as well as closing costs and upgrades to the property that Halsey directed Whitehurst to arrange.  To conceal the true purpose of the wired funds, Whitehurst sent Halsey a fictitious real estate contract purporting to show that the $75,000 was the down payment for a different property that Whitehurst owned in Havre de Grace, Maryland.
On November 21, 2012, the settlement of 127 Ebenezer was held with Halsey representing Cecil Bank as the seller, and Whitehurst as the purported purchaser, selling the property to Whitehurst for $150,000.  Both signed the HUD-1 form which falsely represented that Whitehurst had paid approximately $52,566 at settlement, when in fact, the down payment and all related closing costs were paid from the $75,000 Halsey had wired to Whitehurst’s bank account beforehand.  From October 31, 2012 through March 29, 2013, Halsey transferred an additional $60,000 to Whitehurst to cover the cost the upgrades to the house that they had previously discussed, as well as to reimburse Whitehurst for mortgage payments he made on the property.  Halsey and Whitehurst also made plans to transfer title of the property to Halsey by selling the house to her at a price that would minimize the tax consequences of the sale for Whitehurst.
In December 2012, in response to a question from a bank examiner for the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond inquiring about the sale of the property to Whitehurst, Halsey falsely stated that she was “not totally familiar with [that] property” and that the bank had difficulty marketing the property and had not listed it with a realtor because of “issues with the county over the bonds outstanding.”
In April 2013, federal agents began interviewing employees and other borrowers about banking irregularities at Cecil Bank.  Title to 127 Ebenezer was never transferred to Halsey.  Halsey never told the bank that she was the true purchaser of 127 Ebenezer, nor did the bank know that Halsey and Whitehurst had orchestrated the sale of the foreclosed property at the fraudulent price of $150,000, instead of the appraised pre-renovation price of $295,000.
As a result of Halsey’s misrepresentations and omissions, the bank lost approximately $145,000.
Daniel Whitehurst, age 36, of Bel Air, Maryland, pleaded guilty under seal to the federal charge of mail fraud on April 6, 2018.  Whitehurst faces a maximum sentence of 30 years in federal prison for conspiracy to commit bank fraud.  Judge Chasanow has not scheduled a date for Whitehurst’s sentencing.

Fourth Employee In Cash Flow Partners’ Bank Fraud Conspiracy Admits Role In Multimillion-Dollar Loan Scheme
NEWARK, N.J. – A Passaic County, New Jersey, woman today admitted participating in a scheme that involved the creation of false documentation to secure over $4 million in bank loans, U.S. Attorney Craig Carpenito announced.
Gladys Collins, 43, of Wayne, New Jersey, pleaded guilty by videoconference before U.S. District Judge Kevin McNulty to an information charging her with one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud.
According to documents filed in this case and statements made in court:
Between March 2016 and September 2019, Cash Flow Partners LLC, a business consulting firm with offices in New York and New Jersey, released internet advertisements and held seminars offering to assist customers in obtaining bank loans, including loans insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). When customers submitted documentation supporting their bank loan applications to Cash Flow Partners, Collins and others created false documentation to make customers’ loan applications appear more financially viable than they actually were. Victim banks sustained losses of over $4 million.
Three of Collins’ conspirators, Edward Espinal, Jennie Frias, and Raymundo Torres, have previously pleaded guilty to charges relating to their role in the Cash Flow bank fraud conspiracy and are awaiting sentencing.
The conspiracy to commit bank fraud charge carries a maximum potential penalty of 30 years in prison and a $1 million fine. Sentencing is scheduled for March 8, 2021.
Individuals who believe they may have information about this case may contact the FBI at 1-800-CALL-FBI (225-5324).
U.S. Attorney Carpenito credited special agents of the FDIC-Office of the Inspector General (FDIC-OIG), under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Patricia Tarasca in New York, and special agents of the FBI, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge George M. Crouch Jr. in Newark, with the investigation leading to today’s guilty plea.
The government is represented by Assistant U.S. Attorneys J. Stephen Ferketic of the Opioids Unit and Ari B. Fontecchio of the U.S. Attorney’s Office Economic Crimes Unit in Newark.

R.I. Man Admits to Fraudulently Seeking $4.7 Million in COVID-19 Stimulus Loans,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/ri-man-admits-fraudulently-seeking-47-million-covid-19-stimulus,"October 27, 2020",2020,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

R.I. Man Admits to Fraudulently Seeking $4.7 Million in COVID-19 Stimulus Loans
PROVIDENCE – A Middletown, R.I., man currently serving a term of federal supervised release having been convicted and incarcerated for robbing four banks, admitted in federal court in Providence today to fraudulently seeking more than $4.7 million in Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) forgivable loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (SBA) under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.
The CARES Act was passed by Congress to assist businesses impacted by the pandemic.
Michael C. Moller, 41, admitted that he applied for and received nearly $600,000 in PPP loans he claimed were to be used to pay employees for a Fall River, MA, businesses he operated, “Top Notch Tile.”  FBI and IRS Criminal Investigation agents determined that “Top Notch Tile”  was not incorporated with the Massachusetts Secretary of State, nor could investigators locate any tax or bank records for the company.
Moller admitted that he filed a PPP loan application in his name, and that he caused other applications to be filed in the name of his father and his girlfriend’s brother. As a result of those fraudulent bank loan applications, financial institutions provided Moller a total of $599,251 dollars in stimulus PPP loans he was not entitled to receive.
Additionally, Moller admitted that acting alone, or with family members and associates, he caused eleven fraudulent PPP loan applications to be filed in the name of his girlfriend’s son. The money was to pay employees of “Alves Top Notch,” a Fall River-based business for which investigators could find no records. Among the eight applications were three nearly identical ones filed with different financial institutions, each seeking $734,300 in SBA guaranteed PPP loans. None of the eleven fraudulent applications filed in the name of Moller’s girlfriend’s son resulted in the disbursement of PPP loans.
Appearing today before U.S. District Court Judge Mary S. McElroy, Moller pleaded guilty to bank fraud, announced United States Attorney Aaron L. Weisman, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Boston Division Joseph R. Bonavolonta, and Acting Special Agent in Charge of Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation Joleen Simpson.
Moller, who remains detained in federal custody, is scheduled to be sentenced on January 19, 2021.
According to court records, Moller was convicted in the District of Massachusetts in 2010 for fraud and received a sentence of twenty-four months of supervised release. During his term of supervised release, Moller was convicted of four counts of bank robbery and sentenced to 108 months imprisonment and three years of supervised release. His term of supervised release is scheduled to terminate in July 2022.
The case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Lee H. Vilker.
The matter was investigated by the FBI and IRS-Criminal Investigation, with the assistance of the SBA Office of Inspector General and the FDIC Office of Inspector General.

FIVE CHARGED IN CONNECTION WITH COVID-RELIEF FRAUD SCHEME
Matthew D. Krueger, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Wisconsin, joins Acting Assistant Attorney General Brian C. Rabbitt of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division in announcing five individuals were charged in an indictment based upon their alleged participation in a scheme to file fraudulent loan applications seeking more than $1.1 million in forgivable Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (SBA) under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.
Thomas Smith, Stephen Smith, and Robert Hamilton, all of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and Samuel Davis, Jr., and Jonathan Henley, of Chicago, Illinois were charged in an indictment filed in the Eastern District of Wisconsin with bank fraud and money laundering.
The indictment alleges that the defendants submitted several fraudulent PPP loan applications to a federally insured financial institution and the SBA in the names of businesses with no actual operations or employees.  In the applications, the defendants allegedly misrepresented the number of employees and payroll expenses.  To support the fraudulent applications, the indictment alleges that the defendants submitted fake tax documents.  The indictment alleges that the defendants fraudulently sought over $1.1 million in PPP loan funds.
The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act is a federal law enacted March 29, 2020.  It is designed to provide emergency financial assistance to millions of Americans who are suffering the economic effects resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.
One source of relief provided by the CARES Act is the authorization of up to $349 billion in forgivable loans to small businesses for job retention and certain other expenses through the PPP.  In April 2020, Congress authorized over $300 billion in additional PPP funding.
The PPP allows qualifying small businesses and other organizations to receive loans with a maturity of two years and an interest rate of one percent.  Businesses must use PPP loan proceeds for payroll costs, interest on mortgages, rent, and utilities.  The PPP allows the interest and principal to be forgiven if businesses spend the proceeds on these expenses within a set time period and use at least a certain percentage of the loan towards payroll expenses.
An indictment is merely an allegation and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.
This case was investigated by the U.S. SBA’s Office of Inspector General (OIG), the FBI, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation OIG, and IRS-Criminal Investigation.  Trial Attorneys Laura Connelly and Leslie S. Garthwaite of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Stephen Ingraham of the Eastern District of Wisconsin are prosecuting the case.

Leesburg Man Arrested for $2.5M CARES Act Loan Fraud
ALEXANDRIA, Va. – A Leesburg man was arrested today on charges of fraudulently obtaining over $2.5 million in loans through the CARES Act Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), and then spending the fraudulently obtained money on luxury items.
According to court documents, Didier Kindambu, 48, fraudulently obtained two loans issued under the PPP, a program instituted by Congress in an effort to help businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic continue to pay salary or wages to their employees. Kindambu carried out the scheme in connection with two businesses that he owns by creating fraudulent payroll documentation for each business, and then submitting that documentation in support of the PPP loan applications. In total, Kindambu fraudulently obtained approximately $2,501,753 in loan proceeds, and then spent those funds, in part, on items unrelated to any legitimate PPP-related expense, such as a Lexus automobile and a Cessna aircraft.
Kindambu is scheduled to make his initial appearance in federal court in Alexandria today at 2 p.m.
Kindambu is charged with one count of bank fraud. If convicted, he faces a maximum penalty of 30 years in prison. Actual sentences for federal crimes are typically less than the maximum penalties. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after taking into account the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.
G. Zachary Terwilliger, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia; Kelly R. Jackson, Special Agent in Charge, Washington, D.C. Field Office, IRS-Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI); Hannibal “Mike” Ware, Inspector General of the Small Business Administration (SBA); and Jay N.

Former Aurora Business Owner Sentenced For $30 Million Fraud Schemes,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/former-aurora-business-owner-sentenced-30-million-fraud-schemes,"October 16, 2020",2020,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Former Aurora Business Owner Sentenced For $30 Million Fraud Schemes
SPRINGFIELD, Mo. – A former Aurora, Missouri, business owner was sentenced in federal court today for a series of fraud schemes totaling more than $30 million.
“This white-collar thief maintained his lavish lifestyle by stealing millions of dollars from his clients, partners, and lenders to build expensive homes, buy luxurious cars, and take numerous vacations,” said U.S. Attorney Tim Garrison. “This theft occurred not once or twice, but repeatedly over several years through a series of fraud schemes. Even after being indicted, while free on bond awaiting trial, he brazenly continued to engage in criminal fraud. Today he is being held accountable for the extensive financial damage his greed wreaked upon his victims.”
Russell Grundy, 51, of Hilton Head Island, South Carolina, formerly of Aurora, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Stephen R. Bough to eight years in federal prison without parole. The court also ordered Grundy to pay $14,847,451 in restitution to his victims.
“The elaborate multi-million dollar fraud schemes and false information provided on numerous documents by Mr. Grundy resulted in significant harm to his business partner, a significant client and multiple financial institutions, all of which violate the public trust,” said Adam Steiner, Acting Special Agent in Charge of the IRS Criminal Investigation division in the St. Louis Field Office. “Today’s sentence demonstrates the government’s determination to restore and ensure that trust. Moreover, IRS Criminal Investigation, along with law enforcement partners and the U.S. Attorney’s Office, will continue to identify, investigate, and prosecute individuals like Mr. Grundy.”
On Jan. 30, 2020, Grundy pleaded guilty to two counts of wire fraud, one count of making a false statement on a loan application, and one count of money laundering. According to court documents, Grundy’s multiple schemes to defraud financial institutions, a Native American Tribe, and his former clients, potentially totaled more than $30 million and resulted in nearly $15 million in actual losses.
Grundy was the owner of several companies that focused on advanced technologies, ranging from software development to computer security to addressing the software and hardware technological needs of its clientele. Grundy’s companies included Innovative Objects, LLC, PILR Technology, LLC, Choice Technologies, LLC, Wyerless, LLC, and Audio Input, LLC.
Land O’Lakes/Nutra Blend Fraud Scheme
Grundy (through his company Innovative Objects) was contracted by Land O’Lakes, Inc., and its subsidiary, Nutra Blend, LLC, from January 2004 to Sept. 27, 2015, to create propriety software to inventory, track, and coordinate the shipping of products. Grundy also contracted with Land O’Lakes and Nutra Blend to provide equipment and technical support for the use, upkeep, and maintenance of the software.
Grundy falsely told Land O’Lakes and Nutra Blend that third party software programs were built into that proprietary software and were essential to the successful operation of the software. Grundy claimed that some of the payments made to Innovative Objects were remitted to third party license holders. In reality, there were no third party licensee fees; instead, Grundy kept those payments for his personal or unrelated expenses.
Land O’Lakes and Nutra Blend paid more than $1.8 million in fraudulent license fees between 2012 and 2015.
Miami Nations Enterprise Fraud Scheme
Grundy engaged Miami Nations Enterprise, a subsidiary company of the Miami Nations Tribe, in negotiations to provide loans and to purchase a controlling interest in all of Grundy’s technology-based companies.
Grundy falsely told Miami Nations Enterprise that his companies had been awarded a $3.5 million contract from Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., to develop and provide information technology services. Grundy presented numerous e-mails, invoices, conditional award letters, and other documents to support his false claims. Miami Nations Enterprise loaned Grundy the money to cover the costs associated with software and hardware purchases and training necessary to obtain the $3.5 million Wal-Mart contract. Grundy admitted today that he instead used those funds for his own personal expenses, including building a new home in Charleston, South Carolina.
On Aug. 24, 2014, Miami Nations Enterprise paid an additional $2 million to purchase a 70 percent interest in Grundy’s companies.
Officials with Miami Nations Enterprise later discovered that neither Grundy nor any of his companies had been awarded any contract with Wal-Mart, and determined that the e-mails, conditional contract award, invoices, and bank deposits Grundy had used to support his claims were fraudulently created. Miami Nations Enterprise officials advised that had they been aware of Grundy’s misrepresentations, they would never have purchased any portion of Grundy’s companies or leant him millions of dollars as requested to meet the specifications for an information security program that never existed. Based on records from the financial institution, as well as the numerous misrepresentations made by the defendant, Miami Nations Enterprise transferred a total of $8,010,000 to Grundy.
False Information on Loan Application
Grundy applied for three loans from UMB Bank on Oct. 17, 2014. Grundy specifically admitted that he fraudulently obtained a $5,440,800 loan by providing false information in the loan application. Grundy also submitted a “Change in Terms Agreement” that effectively allowed him to refinance an existing loan based on the information he provided to the bank. The total amount of the loans and “change in terms agreement” fraudulently obtained by Grundy was more than $12 million. After the sale of the seized land and warehouses built with the fraudulently obtained loans, UMB officials have reported a remaining final loss of $4,214,126 after the sale of those assets.
Grundy falsely claimed that Land O’Lakes had agreed to a 20-year lease for warehouse space that he wanted to build using the loans he sought from the bank. Based on lease agreements provided to UMB Bank officials, Grundy claimed he would receive $18 million in future income.
Grundy admitted that he grossly exaggerated the amount of money to be paid by Land O’Lakes in order to obtain the loans from UMB. Rather than one lease agreement between Grundy and Land O’Lakes to rent the warehouses, there were two lease agreements. One lease agreement was for three years at an amount far less than claimed by Grundy. The second lease agreement was a “month-to-month” lease agreement at an even smaller amount. In reality, the true and accurate leases signed and approved by Land O’Lakes only guaranteed Grundy $540,000 in income.
Additional Financial Frauds
After being indicted by a federal grand jury, Grundy was granted bond over the objections of the government. During his pretrial release, according to court documents, Grundy committed two additional known financial frauds.
Grundy contracted with an individual for the creation of a mobile app, for which he was paid $13,230 up front. The app was never completed but Grundy refused the victim’s request for a refund. As a result of this incident, the government moved to have his bond revoked. The court chose not to revoke his bond but did specifically state that Grundy defrauded the victim.
A few months later, Grundy again made false statements on loan documents to Palmetto State Bank in South Carolina in an attempt to fraudulently obtain yet another loan. Grundy vastly overstated his assets and income in order to obtain a loan. But for the diligent efforts of bank officials, Grundy’s fraud and false documents would have resulted in losses that would have amounted to $75,000. Grundy surrendered his bond and was taken into federal custody.
This case was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Patrick Carney and Casey Clark. It was investigated by the FBI, IRS-Criminal Investigation, FDIC-Office of Inspector General, and the Small Business Administration – Office of Inspector General.

Coppell Man Charged in $24 Million PPP Fraud
A Coppell man who spent more than $17 million in Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans on lavish personal expenses has been charged with filing fraudulent loan applications, announced Acting Assistant Attorney General Brian C. Rabbitt of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division and U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Texas Erin Nealy Cox.
A federal grand jury indicted Dinesh Sah, 55, on three counts of wire fraud, three counts of bank fraud and one count of money laundering.
“Mr. Sah exploited this terrible pandemic for personal gain – and he should be held accountable to the American people for that behavior,” said U.S. Attorney Erin Nealy Cox. “COVID-19 has devastated the finances of hardworking business owners across the nation. PPP funds should be reserved for those who really need them to keep their companies afloat. We are committed to ensuring that anyone that take advantage of the system will be brought to justice. ”
“Today’s indictment shows Mr. Sah’s disgraceful display of greed.  Mr. Sah looked at the Paycheck Protection Program as his own personal piggy bank, treating himself to not only millions in cash, but several luxury vehicles and properties, all while legitimate small business owners in the United States desperately sought out ways to put food on their tables and to ensure their employees were paid,” said IRS-CI’s Special Agent in Charge of the Dallas Field Office, Tamera Cantu.  “This indictment reinforces that IRS Criminal Investigation, the U.S. Attorney’s Office and our federal partners in the Northern District of Texas are dedicated to working together to protect innocent Americans from these CARES Act fraudsters.”
According to the indictment, unsealed yesterday evening, Mr. Sah allegedly submitted 15 fraudulent applications, filed under the names of various purported businesses that he owned or controlled, to eight different SBA-approved lenders seeking approximately $24.8 million in PPP loans, which are guaranteed by the  Small Business Administration (SBA) under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.
In his applications, Sah allegedly claimed that these businesses had numerous employees and hundreds of thousands of dollars in payroll expenses – when, in fact, Sah created many of the businesses after the CARES Act was enacted, and no business had employees or paid wages consistent with the amounts claimed in the PPP applications.  Sah also submitted fraudulent documentation in support of his applications, including falsified federal tax filings and forged bank statements for the purported businesses.
Sah ultimately received approximately $17.7 million in PPP loan funds and allegedly used the proceeds primarily for personal expenses, spending them on multiple homes and luxury cars, including a 2020 Bentley convertible, and sending millions of dollars in international transfers, the indictment alleges.
To date, the government has seized more than $6.5 million in fraudulent proceeds that Sah obtained during the scheme.
The CARES Act is a federal law enacted on March 29, 2020.  It is designed to provide emergency financial assistance to millions of Americans who are suffering the economic effects resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.  One source of relief provided by the CARES Act is the authorization of up to $349 billion in forgivable loans to small businesses for job retention and certain other expenses through the PPP.  In April 2020, Congress authorized over $300 billion in additional PPP funding.

An indictment is merely an allegation, no evidence. Like all defendants, Mr. Sah is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty in a court of law.
This case was investigated by the Dallas Field Offices of FDIC Office of Inspector General, IRS - Criminal Investigations Division, and the U.S. Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration.  Assistant Deputy Chief Anna G. Kaminska of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section Economic Crimes and Public Corruption Section Chief Katherine Miller of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Texas, and Assistant U.S. Attorney  Erica Hilliard of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Texas are prosecuting the case.

North Carolina Man Charged with Fraudulently Seeking Over $6 Million in COVID Relief Funds
A North Carolina man was charged with fraudulently seeking over $6 million in Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans, announced Acting Assistant Attorney General Brian C. Rabbitt of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division and U.S. Attorney Robert J. Higdon Jr. of the Eastern District of North Carolina.
Tristan Bishop Pan, 38, of Garner, is charged with wire fraud, bank fraud, and engaging in unlawful monetary transactions.
The indictment, unsealed today, alleges that Pan perpetrated a scheme to submit fraudulent PPP loan applications to federally insured banks.  The Small Business Administration (SBA) guarantees PPP loans under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.  According to the allegations, Pan submitted numerous fraudulent PPP loan applications, including on behalf of entities named Pan Insurance Agency, White Walker, Khaleesi, and The Night’s Watch.  The indictment alleges that, in support of the fraudulent PPP loan applications, Pan made false statements about the companies’ employees and payroll expenses.  The PPP loan applications were supported by fake documents, including falsified tax filings, according to the indictment.  Pan allegedly submitted fourteen PPP loan applications seeking over $6.1 million and received more than $1.7 million in benefits following approval of the Pan Insurance Agency and White Walker PPP loan applications.  The government was able to seize some of the allegedly fraudulent loan benefits.
The CARES Act is a federal law enacted March 29.  It is designed to provide emergency financial assistance to millions of Americans who are suffering the economic effects resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.  One source of relief the CARES Act provides is the authorization of up to $349 billion in forgivable loans to small businesses for job retention and certain other expenses through the PPP.  In April 2020, Congress authorized over $300 billion in additional PPP funding.

South Florida Lawyer Charged with Fraud Related to 1 Global Capital Investment Scheme,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/south-florida-lawyer-charged-fraud-related-1-global-capital,"September 29, 2020",2020,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

South Florida Lawyer Charged with Fraud Related to 1 Global Capital Investment Scheme
A Florida attorney and former outside counsel for 1 Global Capital LLC (1 Global), has been charged today with conspiring to commit wire fraud and securities fraud in connection with an investment fraud scheme that as alleged impacted more than 3,600 investors in 42 different states, and involved him personally and fraudulently raising more than $100 million from investors.
Andrew Dale Ledbetter, 78, of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, is charged in an information with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and securities fraud.  The case is assigned to U.S. District Judge Darrin P. Gayles of the Southern District of Florida.
According to the allegations in the information, 1 Global was a commercial lending business based in Hallandale Beach, Florida, that made the equivalent of “pay day” loans with high interest rates to small businesses, termed merchant cash advance loans (MCAs).  To fund these loans, 1 Global obtained funds from investors nationwide, offering short-term investment contracts that promised to “place” the investors’ money onto MCAs.  The investors would supposedly receive a proportionate share of the principal and interest payments as the loans were repaid.  1 Global raised money using investment advisors and other intermediaries, with promises to these advisors of significant commissions.  In many cases, according to court documents, the commissions were not fully disclosed to investors.  Ledbetter was an attorney licensed in the State of Florida who worked at Law Firm #1 and acted in a fundraising capacity at 1 Global beginning in or around 2015.
Substantial questions arose during the operation of the business as to whether 1 Global was offering or selling a security and whether the investment offering was required to be registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  These questions were raised by investors, investment advisors, and regulators.  Ledbetter and Jan Douglas Atlas, a partner at Law Firm #1 who also acted as outside counsel for 1 Global, knew that if 1 Global’s investment offering were determined to be a security, it would undermine the ability of 1 Global to raise funds from retail investors and to continue to operate without substantial additional expenses and reporting requirements.  Such a classification would undermine the profits and fees that Ledbetter and other principals at 1 Global would be able to obtain from 1 Global’s operations.
The information alleges that at the request of 1 Global’s principals, Atlas authored two opinion letters in 2016 containing false information that Atlas knew would be used by 1 Global to operate the business unlawfully.  The opinion letters falsely described the duration of the investment, among other things, omitting the automatic renewal aspect and that the investment was being targeted toward retail, non-sophisticated investors (such as IRA account holders).   According to the information, Ledbetter used and relied on Atlas’s opinion letters to continue to raise money illegally, knowing that the opinion letters falsely described the investment opportunity and were thus misleading.  Ledbetter cited and used the false letters in numerous pitches and communications to investment advisors and investors.
According to the information, Ledbetter was personally involved in raising more than $100 million in investor funds that went to 1 Global, through his own pitches as well as through investment advisors he attracted to 1 Global.  Over the years, Ledbetter received approximately $3 million from 1 Global, the majority of which was for commissions.  Ledbetter routinely held himself out to investors and investment advisers as outside counsel to 1 Global, and also personally vouched for 1 Global in pitches and marketing materials.  However, Ledbetter did not disclose the commissions that he received from 1 Global to investors, according to the information.  Ledbetter also made misrepresentations to investors regarding the involvement of an outside auditing firm.
A number of individuals have entered guilty pleas in connection with the 1 Global fraud scheme.  Alan G. Heide, the former 1 Global chief financial officer, was charged via information and sentenced to 60 months, in Case No. 19-60231-CR-RKA.  Atlas, former outside counsel for 1 Global, was charged via information, pleaded guilty, and is awaiting sentencing in Case No. 19-60258-RKA, currently scheduled for Nov. 17, 2020.  Steven Schwartz, a former director of 1 Global, was charged via information, pleaded guilty, and is awaiting sentencing in Case No. 20-60003-RKA, currently scheduled for Nov. 13, 2020.  Information about the related cases can be found here: https://www.justice.gov/criminal-vns/case/1Global-Capital .
In connection with a parallel civil enforcement action, the SEC today announced the filing of civil fraud charges against Ledbetter.  In related cases, the SEC previously has filed civil fraud actions, SEC v. 1 Global Capital LLC and Carl C. Ruderman , Case No. 18-61991-CV-BB (Sothern District of Florida) SEC v. Alan G. Heide , Case No. 19-62047-CV-FAM (Southern District of Florida), and SEC v. Jan Atlas , Case No. 19-62303-WPD (Southern District of Florida).  The bankruptcy case, In re: 1 Global Capital LLC, et al ., No. 18-19121-RBR (Southern District of Florida), remains pending.

Hardin County Man Convicted of Conspiracy and Bank Fraud
Jackson, TN– Following a week-long trial with proper COVID-19 health and safety protocols, a federal jury has convicted Charles Ray Smith, 71, of Crump, Tenn., of defrauding three banks in Tennessee and Alabama. D. Michael Dunavant, U.S. Attorney announced the guilty verdict today.
According to information presented in court, Smith owned and operated several aggregate materials businesses in Tennessee, Alabama and Louisiana. From March 2009 until February 2012, Smith defrauded Central Bank in Savannah, Tenn., by depositing and directing others to deposit more than $116 million in fraudulent bank checks into his companies’ bank account. Smith also defrauded Wayne County Bank, in Waynesboro, Tenn., and First Metro Bank, in Muscle Shoals, Ala., by falsifying collateral to obtain loans. As a result, Smith stole more than $ 9.9 million from the victim banks.
The jury convicted Smith of all of the counts in the indictment, charging him with conspiracy to commit bank fraud, and seven counts of bank fraud.
The sentencing hearing is scheduled for January 5, 2021, before Chief U.S. District Judge S. Thomas Anderson, who also presided over the trial. Smith faces up to 30 years in prison for each count in the indictment, and a $1 million fine. There is no parole in the federal system.
U.S. Attorney D. Michael Dunavant said, ""The financial fraud committed by this defendant is massive, and had a significant negative impact on the shareholders, employees and customers of his bank victims. The U.S. Attorney’s Office places a high priority on protecting the security and integrity of transactions, deposits and assets of financial institutions, and this guilty verdict demonstrates that commitment. Smith has now been held accountable for his brazen crimes of dishonesty.""
The case was investigated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of Inspector General, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Assistant U.S. Attorneys Dean DeCandia and Matt Wilson prosecuted this case on behalf of the United States.

RI Man Charged with Fraudulently Seeking $4.7 Million in Covid-19 Stimulus Loans
PROVIDENCE – A Middletown, RI, man currently on federal supervised release having been previously sentenced for robbing four banks, is facing charges in federal court in Providence for allegedly filing fraudulent loan applications seeking more than $4.7 million in Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) forgivable loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (SBA) under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. The CARES Act was passed by Congress to assist businesses impacted by the pandemic.
It is alleged that Michael C. Moller, 41, applied for and received nearly $600,000 in PPP loans to pay employees for Fall River, MA, businesses, none of which are incorporated with the Massachusetts Secretary of State, or for which investigators could locate any tax or bank records.
According to court documents, it is alleged that Moller filed a PPP loan application in his name, and caused applications to be filed in the name of his father and his girlfriend’s brother. As a result of those bank loan applications, financial institutions provided Moller a total of $599,251 dollars in stimulus PPP loans he was not entitled to receive.
Additionally, it is alleged that Moller, alone or with family members and associates, filed eight fraudulent PPP loan applications, all in the name of his girlfriend’s son, to pay employees for a Fall River-based business for which investigators could find no records. Among the eight applications were three nearly identical ones filed with different financial institutions, each seeking $734,300 in SBA guaranteed PPP loans. None of the eleven applications allegedly filed in the name of Moller’s girlfriend’s son resulted in the disbursement of PPP loans.
Moller, arrested today by FBI and IRS- Criminal Investigation agents on a criminal complaint charging him with making false statements to influence the Small Business Administration and with bank fraud, appeared before U.S. District Court Magistrate Judge Lincoln D. Almond and was ordered detained.
According to court records, Moller was convicted in the District of Massachusetts in 2010 for fraud and received a sentence of twenty-four months of supervised release. During his term of supervised release, Moller was convicted of four counts of bank robbery and sentenced to 108 months imprisonment and three years of supervised release. His term of supervised release is scheduled to terminate in July 2022.
A federal criminal complaint is merely an accusation. A defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.
The case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Lee H. Vilker.
The matter is being investigated by the FBI and IRS-Criminal Investigation, with the assistance of the SBA Office of Inspector General and the FDIC Office of Inspector General.

Camaroon Man Pleads Guilty to Defrauding Bourbonnais Bank
PEORIA, Ill. – A citizen of Cameroon, Lovette Namatinga, 33, entered pleas of guilty this morning to defrauding a Bourbonnais, Ill., bank. Namatinga pleaded guilty to all counts of the indictment immediately prior to jury selection as his trial was about to begin in Peoria, Ill., before U.S. District Judge James E. Shadid. Sentencing for Namatinga has been scheduled on Jan. 7, 2021.
Namatinga, of Owings Mills, Md., has remained in the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service since he was arrested on Oct. 7, 2019, at Washington Dulles International Airport by FDIC Office of Inspector General agents.
Today, Namatinga pleaded guilty to defrauding Municipal Trust and Savings Bank, Bourbonnais, Ill. Namatinga admitted that he carried out the fraud from about February to April 2019, by falsely representing to the bank that the secretary of one of the bank’s customers requested that cashier’s checks be sent to Namatinga’s fraudulent company known as Keiko San Products Alimenticious, LLC. Namatinga is the registered agent for Keiko, and the four checks were mailed to his home address. Once the checks were deposited into Keiko bank accounts, Namatinga then transferred money from those accounts to his personal account or withdrew cash from those accounts. The loss to the bank was approximately $140,000.
In addition to the fraud committed through Municipal Trust & Savings Bank, Namatinga used his fraudulent business and multiple associated bank accounts to deposit and launder fraud proceeds from various other financial institutions throughout the United States.
For each offense of bank fraud (four counts) and wire fraud (four counts), the statutory penalty is up to 30 years in prison and a fine of up to $1,000,000.
The charges are the result of an investigation by the FDIC Office of Inspector General. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Eugene L. Miller and Keith Cook are representing the government in the prosecution.

Raleigh County Pharmacist Pleads Guilty to Wire Fraud and Money Laundering
BECKLEY, W.Va. – Natalie P. Cochran, 39, of Daniels, pled guilty in federal court today to fraud charges, announced United States Attorney Mike Stuart. Cochran, a Raleigh County pharmacist and owner of two companies in Beckley - Technology Management Solutions (TMS) and Tactical Solutions Group (TSG) - pled guilty to wire fraud and money laundering.   Pursuant to her plea agreement, Cochran also agreed to pay nearly $2.6 million in restitution to her victims and to forfeit her interest to the United States in the assets she obtained through her fraudulent activities, including two pieces of real property, a 1965 Shelby Cobra, multiple vehicles, pieces of jewelry, and nearly $45,000 seized from her business’ bank account.
“Today, Natalie Cochran admitted and pled guilty of committing the federal crimes of wire fraud and money laundering,” said United States Attorney Mike Stuart. “In terms of this agreement, trust me, this is a difficult day for Natalie Cochran. Not only could she be sentenced to more than 11 years in prison, Cochran agreed to forfeiture of a substantial amount of cash and assets.  Cochran also waived her right to appeal.  Cochran pled guilty. I am pleased that this agreement results in the goal I have in every case - justice for victims and taxpayers.”
Cochran admitted that from approximately June 2017 through at least August 22, 2019, she knowingly defrauded and took money and property from individuals, a financial institution and several other companies. She induced them to invest in TMS and TSG and in phony government contracts by making false misrepresentations regarding her and her companies’ experience and purported success as government contractors.  Cochran further admitted that she convinced at least 11 people to invest approximately $2.5 million in alleged government contracts. The investors paid through personal checks, cashier’s checks and wire transfers. She also convinced an investor to send $511,920 through a wire transfer from North Carolina. She further admitted she never invested the money she received but put it into her personal and business bank accounts for personal purposes unrelated to the investments. Cochran admitted to using investor funds to make numerous purchases over $10,000, including withdrawing more than $37,500 to purchase a 1965 Shelby Cobra. She also admitted to knowing that at least one of her investors suffered a financial hardship as a result of her scheme.  In order to keep up appearances, Cochran admitted to using some investors’ funds to pay other investors a partial return on their investment.
Cochran faces up to 135 months in prison when sentenced on January 4, 2021.
The West Virginia State Police, the United States Secret Service, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation – Office of Inspector General (FDIC-OIG) conducted the investigation. United States District Judge Frank W. Volk presided over the hearing. Assistant United States Attorneys Kathleen Robeson and Greg McVey are handling the prosecution.

Warwick Man Admits to Conspire to Fraudulently Obtain COVID-19 Stimulus Loans,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/warwick-man-admits-conspire-fraudulently-obtain-covid-19,"September 18, 2020",2020,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Warwick Man Admits to Conspire to Fraudulently Obtain COVID-19 Stimulus Loans
PROVIDENCE – A Warwick man today admitted to a federal court judge that he participated in a conspiracy with a Massachusetts man to submit fraudulent bank loan applications to a Rhode Island bank in an effort to obtain hundreds of thousands of dollars in forgivable loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (SBA) under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, passed by Congress to assist businesses impacted by the pandemic.
David Andrew Butziger, 52, admitted that he conspired with David Adler Staveley, a/k/a Kurt David Sanborn, a/k/a David Sanborn, 53, of Andover, MA, to seek forgivable loans guaranteed by the SBA, claiming to have dozens of employees earning wages at four different business, three restaurants and an electronics business, when, in fact, there were no employees working for any of the businesses.
Butziger admitted that he submitted a loan application to BankNewport under the federal Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), part of the CARES Act passed by Congress on March 29,2000, on behalf of an unincorporated entity that he called Dock Wireless. The loan application was in the amount of $105,381.50 and fraudulently represented that Dock Wireless had 7 employees and an average monthly payroll of $42,152.60. According to the government, in truth and in fact, Dock Wireless had no employees and no wages were ever paid by Dock Wireless.
Butziger admitted that he conspired with Staveley who himself allegedly submitted three fraudulent bank loan applications for SBA loans under the PPP totaling $438,577. It is alleged that Staveley claimed the loans were to be used to pay employees at three restaurants he claimed to own and to be operating, including Top of the Bay and Remington House in Warwick and On The Trax in Berlin, MA.
An investigation determined that Remington House and On The Trax were not open for business prior to the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and at the time the loan applications were submitted, and that Staveley did not own or have any role in Top of the Bay restaurant.
Appearing today before U.S. District Court Judge Mary S. McElroy, Butziger pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit bank fraud, announced United States Attorney Aaron L. Weisman, Special Agent in Charge Joseph R. Bonavolonta of the FBI’s Boston Field Office, and Acting Special Agent in Charge of Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation Joleen Simpson.
Butziger is scheduled to be sentenced on December 18, 2020.
A federal grand jury returned an indictment on September 2, 2020, charging Staveley with three counts of bank fraud and one count each of conspiracy to commit bank fraud, false statements to influence the SBA, aggravated identity theft, and failure to appear in court as required.
After having been having been charged by way of a federal criminal complaint in May 2020 for his alleged role in the conspiracy to gain four fraudulent SBA PPP loans, and while on pre-trial release, Staveley allegedly faked his own death and failed to appear in court, as ordered by the court. It is alleged that from May 26, 2020, to July 23, 2020, in an effort to avoid apprehension, Staveley traveled to various States using false identities and stolen license plates. He was apprehended by the United States Marshals Service in Alpharetta, Georgia on July 23, 2020.
Staveley is now detained in federal custody while awaiting trial.
A federal indictment and a criminal complaint are merely accusations. A defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.
The cases are being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Lee H. Vilker.
The Justice Department acknowledges and thanks the SBA Office of Inspector General and the FDIC, Office of Inspector General for their efforts investigating this mater.

Hotel Owner Pleads Guilty to Conspiring with Bank President to Defraud First NBC Bank
NEW ORLEANS – The United States Attorney’s Office announced that ARVIND “MIKE” VIRA (“VIRA”), age 74, a resident of New Orleans, Louisiana, pled guilty today to a years-long conspiracy with First NBC Bank president Ashton J. Ryan to defraud the New Orleans-based bank that failed in April 2017.
According to court documents, in 2006, Ryan lobbied VIRA to move his business accounts to First NBC Bank.  VIRA agreed and became a customer of First NBC Bank.  Thereafter, Ryan provided VIRA with preferential treatment.  Although VIRA was assigned another loan officer, Ryan acted as his de facto loan officer at the bank.  Ryan provided VIRA with low interest rates for VIRA’s loans.  He also ensured that VIRA received high interest rates on his savings and checking accounts.  Ryan personally approved 3% interest rates for savings and checking accounts held by VIRA, his businesses, and his family members.  Ryan instructed VIRA to inflate his assets on bank loan documents, and VIRA complied by claiming to have substantial real estate and outside bank accounts that did not exist.
VIRA, in turn, provided personal loans to Ryan at Ryan’s request.  Ryan, knowing that such a loan relationship was prohibited by banking regulations, instructed VIRA to conceal this personal loan relationship from First NBC Bank employees.  During an FDIC regulatory exam in December 2012, FDIC examiners discovered that Ryan had borrowed money from First NBC Bank using VIRA’s loan proceeds. When examiners questioned him, Ryan admitted to their relationship, but claimed that he had not been aware that the source of the funds were First NBC Bank loan proceeds.
In order to further conceal the loans that he made to Ryan, VIRA misrepresented or omitted the interest payments he received from Ryan on his personal tax returns from 2011 through 2015.  From 2011 through 2017, VIRA received approximately $1,220,271.07 in profits from Ryan’s interest payments and from Ryan’s preferential treatment at First NBC Bank.
“The FBI and our law enforcement partners have dedicated significant time and resources toward investigating the failure of FNBC, which resulted in nearly a billion dollar loss to the FDIC. Individuals like Mr. Vira who engage in fraudulent schemes that impact the security of financial institutions are being held accountable. His guilty plea today should be a deterrent to others who would attempt to defraud our nation's banking system,” said Bryan Vorndran, FBI New Orleans Special Agent in Charge.
“We are pleased to work with our law enforcement partners in bringing to justice those who conspire to defraud financial institutions regulated and supervised by the Federal Reserve Board,” said Stephen Donnelly, Acting Special Agent in Charge, Eastern Region, Office of Inspector General for the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection.
“We are pleased to join our law enforcement colleagues in bringing Mr. Vira to justice,” stated Laurie Younger, Special Agent in Charge of the Office of Inspector General for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
VIRA pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Sections 371 and 1344.  The maximum penalties that may be imposed at sentencing are five years in prison; a fine of $250,000 or the greater of twice the gain to VIRA or twice the loss to any victim; and up to three years of supervised release.
U.S. District Judge Nannette Jolivette Brown set VIRA’s sentencing for January 7, 2020.
This case is being investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation; the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of Inspector General; and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Office of Inspector General. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Sharan E. Lieberman, Matthew R. Payne, Nicholas D. Moses, and J. Ryan McLaren are in charge of the prosecution.

Texas Man Charged in Miami Federal Court with Using False Payroll Documents To Obtain $1.2 Million in Covid Relief
MIAMI – Texas resident Uzoamaka Leonard Ohaebosim, 46, has been charged in the Southern District of Florida with federal bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution after allegedly lying about his movie company’s payroll expenses and obtaining $1.2 million in Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) funds.
Ohaebosim was arrested in Texas and made his initial appearance in federal court there today. Authorities have seized the money.
U.S. Attorney Ariana Fajardo Orshan of the Southern District of Florida, Special Agent in Charge Kyle Myles of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) Office of Inspector General (OIG), Office of Investigation’s Atlanta Regional Office, Eastern Regional Office, Gary Smith, Special-Agent-in-Charge, Southern Field Division, Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA), Special Agent in Charge Michael J. De Palma of the IRS-Criminal Investigation (CI) Miami Office, and Special Agent in Charge Kevin A. Kupperbusch of the U.S. Small Business Association (SBA)-OIG, Investigations Division made the announcement.
The criminal complaint alleges that Ohaebosim sought approximately $1.2 million in PPP loans through applications to an insured financial institution.  The complaint alleges that Ohaebosim submitted a PPP loan application that made numerous false and misleading statements regarding his company’s payroll expenses.  Specifically, as part of the loan application,  Ohaebosim allegedly provided a false IRS payroll tax form indicating that his company, Spite the Movie, LLC (“STM”), had over 100 employees who had received wages of approximately $983,000 with taxes withheld of approximately $122,000 in the first quarter of 2020.  In truth, and in fact, STM had not paid these employees and had not filed this form with the IRS.  Relying on this false IRS form, the financial institution in South Florida approved and funded approximately $1.2 million in PPP loans.  Law enforcement has seized these funds.
The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act is a federal law enacted March 29.  It is designed to provide emergency financial assistance to millions of Americans who are suffering the economic effects resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.  One source of relief provided by the CARES Act is the authorization of up to $349 billion in forgivable loans to small businesses for job retention and certain other expenses through the PPP.  In April 2020, Congress authorized over $300 billion in additional PPP funding.
The PPP allows qualifying small businesses and other organizations to receive loans with a maturity of two years and an interest rate of one percent.  Businesses must use PPP loan proceeds for payroll costs, interest on mortgages, rent and utilities.  The PPP allows the interest and principal to be forgiven if businesses spend the proceeds on these expenses within a set time period and use at least a certain percentage of the loan towards payroll expenses.
A criminal complaint is merely an allegation and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a  court of law.
This case was investigated by the FDIC-OIG, TIGTA, IRS-CI, and the SBA-OIG.  Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Berger of the Southern District of Florida is prosecuting the case.

Former Foreign Exchange Trader Sentenced To Prison For Price Fixing And Bid Rigging
Akshay Aiyer, a former currency trader at a major multinational bank, was sentenced to serve eight months in jail and ordered to pay a $150,000 criminal fine for his participation in an antitrust conspiracy to manipulate prices for emerging market currencies in the global foreign currency exchange (FX) market, the Justice Department announced today.
On Nov. 20, 2019, Aiyer was convicted after a three-week jury trial in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York for conspiring to fix prices and rig bids in Central and Eastern European, Middle Eastern, and African (CEEMEA) currencies, which were generally traded against the U.S. dollar and the euro, from at least October 2010 through at least January 2013.
“Today’s sentence, including prison time, serves as yet another reminder of the consequences for those who cheat and compromise the integrity of the global financial markets,” said Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim of the Department of Justice’s Antitrust Division.  “This case, which the Antitrust Division litigated, is another step forward in the department’s ongoing commitment to prosecute and deter cartels in the financial markets that harm American consumers.”
“Today’s sentencing demonstrates the gravity of the defendant’s egregious behavior to manipulate emerging market currencies, as well as the importance of bringing him to justice,” said FDIC Inspector General Jay N. Lerner.  “This extensive conspiracy represents a serious breach of trust with both his clients and the major multinational bank for whom he worked.  We appreciate the cooperation of our law enforcement partners, and we remain committed to investigate such unscrupulous crimes that impact the integrity of our banking sector.”
According to evidence presented at trial, the defendant engaged in near-daily communications with his co-conspirators by phone, text, and through an exclusive electronic chat room to coordinate their trades of the CEEMEA currencies in the FX spot market.  The jury heard evidence that the defendant and his co-conspirators manipulated exchange rates by agreeing to withhold bids or offers to avoid moving the exchange rate in a direction adverse to open positions held by co-conspirators and by coordinating their trading to manipulate the rates in an effort to increase their profits.  By agreeing not to buy or sell at certain times, the conspiring traders protected each other’s trading positions by withholding supply of or demand for currency and suppressing competition in the FX spot market for emerging market currencies.  They also heard evidence that the defendant and his co-conspirators took steps to conceal their actions by, among other steps, using code names, communicating on personal cell phones during work hours, and meeting in person to discuss particular customers and trading strategies.
The Antitrust Division has charged five companies and six individuals in its investigation of collusion in the FX spot market. On May 20, 2015, four major banks – Citicorp, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Barclays PLC, and The Royal Bank of Scotland plc – pleaded guilty and agreed to collectively pay more than $2.5 billion in criminal fines for their participation in an antitrust conspiracy in the euro-U.S. dollar FX spot market. On Jan. 25, 2018, BNP Paribas USA, Inc. pleaded guilty and agreed to pay a $90 million criminal fine for its participation in an antitrust conspiracy involving emerging market FX prices. On Jan. 4, 2017 and Jan. 12, 2017 , plea agreements were announced for two former traders in connection with an antitrust conspiracy involving emerging market FX prices.
The sentence announced today is a result of an ongoing investigation into collusion in the financial markets, which is being conducted by the Antitrust Division’s New York Office, FDIC Office of Inspector General, and the FBI’s Washington Field Office.  The Criminal Division’s Fraud Section also provided substantial assistance in this matter.  Anyone with information on price fixing, bid rigging, or other anticompetitive conduct in the financial markets should contact the Antitrust Division’s New York Office at 212-335-8000 or visit www.justice.gov/atr/contact/newcase.html .

New York Brothers Charged With COVID-Relief Fraud
Two New York brothers were charged in a criminal complaint unsealed today for their alleged participation in a scheme to file fraudulent loan applications seeking nearly $7 million in forgivable Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (SBA) under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, announced Acting Assistant Attorney General Brian C. Rabbitt of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division and U.S. Attorney James P. Kennedy, Jr. of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of New York.
Larry Jordan, 42, Lancaster, New York, and Sutukh El, aka Curtis Jordan and Hugo Hurt, 38, of Buffalo, New York, were charged in a complaint filed in the Western District of New York with wire fraud conspiracy.  Both individuals were arrested this morning and are scheduled to appear today before U.S. Magistrate Judge H. Kenneth Schroeder, Jr. in the Western District of New York.
The complaint alleges that Jordan and El conspired to, and did, submit at least eight fraudulent loan applications in an attempt to obtain nearly $7 million.  The complaint also alleges that, in support of the fraudulent loan applications, Jordan and El made numerous false and misleading statements about the companies’ respective business operations and payroll expenses.
The complaint further alleges that the fraudulent loan applications were supported by fake documents, including falsified federal tax filings.  For example, included in one application for 5 Stems Inc was a fraudulent IRS filing that appeared to be the company’s 2019 federal unemployment tax return showing that the company paid nearly $3.3 million in employee wages that year.  In reality, the IRS has no record of such a filing.
The complaint further alleges that Jordan and El used fraudulently obtained loan proceeds on what appear to be personal expenses, including the purchase of securities, home improvements, and a vehicle.  To date, the government has seized more than $400,000 of the more than $600,000 that Jordan and El obtained in their alleged fraud.
The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act is a federal law enacted March 29.  It is designed to provide emergency financial assistance to millions of Americans who are suffering the economic effects resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.  One source of relief provided by the CARES Act is the authorization of up to $349 billion in forgivable loans to small businesses for job retention and certain other expenses through the PPP.  In April 2020, Congress authorized over $300 billion in additional PPP funding.
The PPP allows qualifying small businesses and other organizations to receive loans with a maturity of two years and an interest rate of one percent.  Businesses must use PPP loan proceeds for payroll costs, interest on mortgages, rent and utilities.  The PPP allows the interest and principal to be forgiven if businesses spend the proceeds on these expenses within a set time period and use at least a certain percentage of the loan towards payroll expenses.
A criminal complaint is merely an allegation and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.
This case was investigated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s Office of Inspector General (OIG), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection’s OIG, the Federal Housing Finance Agency’s OIG, the FBI, and the SBA’s OIG.  Trial Attorney Della Sentilles of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Charles Kruly and Grace Carducci for the Western District of New York are prosecuting the case.

One Person Indicted, Second Person to Plead Guilty in COVID-19 Stimulus Fraud Investigation
PROVIDENCE – A Massachusetts man who failed to appear in federal court in Rhode Island and who allegedly faked his own death after being charged and arraigned on fraud and conspiracy charges for his alleged participation in a conspiracy to file bank loan applications fraudulently seeking more than a half-million dollars in forgivable loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (SBA) under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, has been indicted by a federal grand jury in Providence.
David Adler Staveley, a/k/a Kurt David Sanborn, a/k/a David Sanborn, 53, of Andover, MA, has been indicted on three counts of bank fraud and one count each of conspiracy to commit bank fraud, false statements to influence the SBA, aggravated identity theft, and failure to appear in court as required.
According to an information and plea agreement filed with the court, alleged co-conspirator David Andrew Butziger, 52, of Warwick RI, has agreed to plead guilty to conspiracy to commit bank fraud. A court date has not yet been scheduled.
It is alleged that Staveley and Butziger conspired to seek forgivable loans guaranteed by the SBA, claiming to have dozens of employees earning wages at four different business, three restaurants and an electronics business, entities when, in fact, there were no employees working for any of the businesses. Additionally, it is alleged that Staveley posed as his brother in real estate transactions.
It is alleged in the indictment that Staveley, following his arrest on May 5, 2020, and released by the court on unsecured bond with certain travel restrictions, violated the terms of pre-trial release when he traveled to Connecticut without the approval of the court or United States Probation. On May 11, 2020, the court ordered Staveley to home confinement with GPS monitoring. While awaiting a further court hearing on the pre-trial release violation, it is alleged that Staveley cut off his electronic monitoring bracelet and fled.
According to the indictment, in an effort to deceive law enforcement into believing that he had died, it is alleged that Staveley staged his suicide by, among other things, leaving suicide notes with associates and in his car, which he left unlocked and parked by the Atlantic Ocean. It is alleged that from May 26, 2020, to July 23, 2020, in an effort to avoid apprehension, Staveley traveled to various States using false identities and stolen license plates. He was apprehended by the United States Marshals Service in Alpharetta, Georgia on July 23, 2020.
The CARES Act is a federal law enacted on March 29, 2020, designed to provide emergency financial assistance to the millions of Americans who are suffering the economic effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.  One source of relief provided by the CARES Act was the authorization of up to $349 billion in forgivable loans to small businesses for job retention and certain other expenses, through the PPP.  In April 2020, Congress authorized over $300 billion in additional PPP funding.
The PPP allows qualifying small-businesses and other organizations to receive loans with a maturity of two years and an interest rate of one percent.  PPP loan proceeds must be used by businesses on payroll costs, interest on mortgages, rent, and utilities.  The PPP allows the interest and principal to be forgiven if businesses spend the proceeds on these expenses within eight weeks of receipt and use at least 75 percent of the forgiven amount for payroll.
The indictment of Staveley and the filing of an information and plea agreement in the case against Butziger are announced by United States Attorney Aaron L. Weisman, Special Agent in Charge Joseph R. Bonavolonta of the FBI’s Boston Field Office, and Acting Special Agent in Charge of Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation Joleen Simpson.
A federal indictment and an information are merely accusations. A defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.
The cases are being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Lee H. Vilker.
The Justice Department acknowledges and thanks the SBA Office of Inspector General and the FDIC, Office of Inspector General for their efforts investigating this mater.

Developer Admits to Conspiring with First NBC Bank President to Defraud First NBC Bank,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/developer-admits-conspiring-first-nbc-bank-president-defraud,"September 2, 2020",2020,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Developer Admits to Conspiring with First NBC Bank President to Defraud First NBC Bank
NEW ORLEANS – The United States Attorney’s Office announced that WARREN G. TREME (“TREME”), age 55, a resident of Metairie, Louisiana, pleaded guilty today to conspiracy to defraud First NBC Bank, the New Orleans-based bank that failed in April 2017.
According to court documents, from in or around 2008 through April 2017, TREME had a banking relationship with First NBC Bank, individually and through various entities he controlled. TREME also co-owned several entities with Ashton J. Ryan (“Ryan”), President of First NBC Bank. Because of this conflict of interest, Ryan should not have been involved with TREME’s loans. However, Ryan exercised authority over TREME’s loans with William J. Burnell (“Burnell”), the Bank’s Chief Credit Officer. Throughout TREME’s borrowing relationship at First NBC Bank, TREME lacked sufficient income and cash flow from his businesses to pay his loans and personal expenses. Ryan and Burnell disguised TREME’s true financial condition by making new loans to pay TREME’s existing loans. TREME is the third person to be charged for defrauding First NBC Bank through a business relationship with Ryan, while hiding the fraud from the Bank’s Board, auditors, and examiners. Jeffrey Dunlap, a contractor on Ryan’s project with TREME, has already pled guilty to conspiring with Ryan to fund both that project and his lifestyle by defrauding the Bank. More recently, Arvind “Mike” Vira was charged with conspiring to defraud the Bank, with Ryan’s help, by submitting false financial documents to the Bank while Ryan was personally borrowing from Vira. In addition, on July 10, 2020, a grand jury indicted Ryan, Burnell, First NBC Executive Vice President Robert B. Calloway, and borrower Frank J. Adolph for their roles in the conspiracy to commit bank fraud against First NBC, including fraud involving the TREME loans.
Court documents further describe a scheme by Ryan and Burnell to take $400,000 from TREME’s business partners as part of a settlement. Rather than using the $400,000 to pay down an outstanding loan debt owed by TREME and his business partners, Ryan and Burnell gave $300,000 to TREME. TREME spent the money on gambling, a trip to the Caribbean, and expenses related to a real estate development company TREME co-owned with Ryan. During a subsequent Board meeting, Ryan and Burnell falsely stated that the $300,000 was used to pay down the outstanding loan debt owed by TREME and his business partners.
“The FBI and our law enforcement partners have dedicated significant time and resources toward investigating the failure of FNBC, which resulted in nearly a billion dollar loss to the FDIC. Individuals like Mr. Treme who engage in fraudulent schemes that impact the security of financial institutions are being held accountable. His guilty plea today should be a deterrent to others who would attempt to defraud our nation's banking system,” said Bryan Vorndran, FBI New Orleans Special Agent in Charge.
“We will hold accountable those wrongdoers whose fraudulent actions materially impact financial institutions regulated and supervised by the Federal Reserve Board. I commend our agent and law enforcement partners for their hard work that ultimately led to today’s guilty plea,” said Stephen Donnelly, Acting Special Agent in Charge, Eastern Region, Office of Inspector General for the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection.
“We are pleased to join our law enforcement colleagues in bringing Mr. Treme to justice,” stated Laurie Younger, Special Agent in Charge of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of Inspector General.
TREME pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Sections 1344 and 1349. The maximum penalties that may be imposed upon conviction are thirty years in prison; a fine of $1,000,000, or the greater of twice the gain to TREME or twice the loss to any victim; up to five years of supervised release; and a $100 mandatory special assessment.
Judge Sarah S. Vance set TREME’s sentencing on January 6, 2021, at 10:30a.m.
This case is being investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation; the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of Inspector General; and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Office of Inspector General. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Sharan E. Lieberman, Nicholas D. Moses, Matthew R. Payne, and J. Ryan McLaren are in charge of the prosecution.

Former Bank President Pleads Guilty To Embezzlement

LEXINGTON, Ky. – A former bank president admitted in federal court on Wednesday that he embezzled from the Kentucky bank where he was the president.
Thomas Hinkebein, 59, pleaded guilty to one count of embezzlement by a bank officer, before United States District Chief Judge Danny C. Reeves.  Hinkebein admitted that, between January 12, 2016 and August 13, 2018 and while he was the President of Whitaker Bank, he willfully misapplied assets of the bank.  Specifically, he admitted stealing golf carts and other property of Andover Country Club, an asset owned by Whitaker Bank, and seeking reimbursement from Whitaker Bank for a variety of personal expenses, including cell phone plans, gym memberships, fuel purchases, vehicle repairs, technology purchases for his family members, shipping expenses, and landscaping at his home. To hide the personal nature of these expenses, the Defendant falsely reported many of the expenses to Whitaker Bank to make them appear to be legitimate work expenses.
Hinkebein was charged by way of information, waiving his right to indictment by a federal grand jury.
Robert M. Duncan, Jr., United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Kentucky; John Crawford, Special Agent in Charge, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of Investigations, Chicago Region; and Stephen Donnelly, Acting Special Agent in Charge, Eastern Region, Office of Inspector General for the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, jointly announced the guilty plea.
The investigation was conducted by the FDIC and the Federal Reserve.  The United States was represented by Assistant U.S. Attorney Kate K. Smith.
Hinkebein is scheduled to be sentenced on December 4, 2020.  He faces up to 30 years in prison and a maximum fine of $1 million.  However, any sentence will be imposed by the Court, after its consideration of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and the applicable federal statutes.

Federal Criminal Probe Into Failure of Chicago Bank Adds New Charges and Four Former Employees as Defendants
CHICAGO — An ongoing federal criminal investigation into the failure of a Chicago bank has resulted in charges against four new defendants, all of whom worked for the bank.
Washington Federal Bank for Savings was shut down in December 2017 after the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency determined that the bank was insolvent and had at least $66 million in nonperforming loans.  Last year, two Illinois attorneys – bank customer ROBERT M. KOWALSKI and his sister, JAN R. KOWALSKI – were indicted for allegedly defrauding Robert Kowalski’s creditors and the trustee in his bankruptcy case by concealing cash and property belonging to Robert Kowalski’s bankruptcy estate.  A second superseding indictment returned Thursday renewed the bankruptcy fraud charges against the Kowalskis and added four former Washington Federal employees to the case.  The new indictment also identified the primary creditor victim of the bankruptcy fraud as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.  The employees allegedly conspired with Robert Kowalski and higher-ranking bank officials to embezzle at least $29 million in bank funds in the years preceding the closure.  The employees and the higher-ranking officials allegedly transferred the money to Robert Kowalski and others, often without any documentation, and falsified bank records to conceal the embezzlement from the OCC and the FDIC, the latter having become the receiver of the bank and provider of approximately $90 million to make account holders whole.
The new indictment charges Robert Kowalski, 58, of Chicago, with conspiracy to commit embezzlement and falsify bank records.  Also charged in the conspiracy are the four former bank employees: ROSALLIE C. CORVITE, 45, of Chicago, who served as Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; JANE V. IRIONDO, formerly known as Jane V. Tran, 39, of Boise, Idaho, who served as Corporate Secretary; ALICIA MANDUJANO, 49, of Chicago, who worked as a loan servicer; and CATHY M. TORRES, 39, of Chicago, who worked as a loan officer.  The four employees also face individual counts of falsifying bank records.  In addition to renewing the bankruptcy fraud charges against Robert Kowalski and Jan Kowalski, 56, of LaGrange, the new indictment also adds several tax counts against Robert Kowalski for allegedly failing to file income tax returns and filing false personal and corporate returns for various years.
Arraignments in U.S. District Court in Chicago have not yet been scheduled.
The indictment was announced by John R. Lausch, Jr., United States Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois; Jay N. Lerner, Inspector General of the FDIC’s Office of Inspector General; Kathy A. Enstrom, Special Agent-in-Charge of IRS Criminal Investigation in Chicago; Emmerson Buie, Jr., Special Agent-in-Charge of the Chicago Field Office of the FBI; Catherine Huber, Special Agent-in-Charge of the Central Region of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, Office of Inspector General; Brad Geary, Special Agent-in-Charge of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's Office of Inspector General in Chicago; Assistant Inspector for Investigations Sally Luttrell of the Department of the Treasury, Office of Inspector General; Joseph M. Ferguson, City of Chicago Inspector General; and Elissa Rhee-Lee, Chicago Housing Authority Inspector General.  Valuable assistance was provided by the U.S. Trustee Program.  The government is represented by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Brian Netols, Michelle Petersen, and Jeremy Daniel.
The criminal investigation remains ongoing.
The public is reminded that an indictment is not evidence of guilt.  The defendants are presumed innocent and entitled to a fair trial at which the government has the burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

Two Men Who Allegedly Used Synthetic Identities, Existing Shell Companies, and Prior Fraud Experience to Exploit Covid-19 Relief Programs Charged in Miami Federal Court
Miami, Fl. -- Federal prosecutors have charged two Florida residents with bank fraud conspiracy for allegedly using synthetic identities to commit crimes, including defrauding banks and stealing over $3 million from Covid-19 relief programs.
Synthetic identities combine real (albeit stolen) identity information, such as stolen social security numbers, with fraudulent identity information, such as fake names and dates of birth. Criminals create these synthetic identities and use them to open fraudulent bank and credit card accounts, and to make fraudulent purchases.
Ariana Fajardo Orshan, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida, Kyle A. Myles, Special Agent in Charge, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of Inspector General – Investigations (FDIC-OIG), Atlanta Region, Brian Swain, Special Agent in Charge, United States Secret Service (USSS), Miami Field Office, Kevin A. Kupperbusch, Special Agent in Charge, U.S. Small Business Administration, Office of Inspector General (SBA-OIG), Investigations Division, Eastern Region, Rod Owens, Special Agent in Charge, Social Security Administration, Office of the Inspector General, Antonio J. Gomez, Inspector in Charge, U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS), Miami Division, and James S. Jackson, Deputy Inspector General for Investigations, Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) made the announcement.
According to the criminal complaint affidavit, beginning around 2017, Jean Fleuridor, 41, of Broward County, Florida and Hasan Brown, 44, of Miami-Dade County, Florida, and their co-conspirators were involved in a scheme to defraud a bank located in San Antonio, Texas. They used approximately 700 synthetic identities, in addition to stolen identities, to create bank accounts and shell companies. According to the criminal complaint, fraudulent payments were made from accounts registered to synthetic identities to accounts registered to defendants Brown and Fleuridor.
From about April through July of 2020, members of the conspiracy allegedly utilized the already-established synthetic identities and associated shell companies to fraudulently apply for assistance under the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), a program established under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act to help small businesses financially survive the pandemic. According to the complaint, the defendants fraudulently sought and received over $3 million dollars in PPP relief.  This money was paid to companies registered to the synthetic identities.
Defendant Fleuridor had his initial appearance on August 26, 2020, and defendant Brown had his initial appearance on August 28, 2020, both before U.S. Magistrate Judge Alicia M. Otazo-Reyes. A copy of the criminal complaint and affidavit is attached to this release.
FDIC-OIG, USSS Miami, SBA-OIG, SSA-OIG, USPIS, and TIGTA are handling the investigation. Assistant U.S. Attorney Brooke Watson, of the Southern District of Florida, is prosecuting the case.  Assistant U.S. Attorney Nicole S. Grosnof, also of the Southern District of Florida, is handling asset forfeiture. Trial Attorney Louis Manzo, from the Department of Justice, Criminal Division, Assistant U.S. Attorney Lauren Elbert, of the Eastern District of New York, and Assistant U.S. Attorney Trenton Reichling, of the Middle District of Florida, provided assistance.
In March 2020, the CARES Act was enacted. It was designed to provide emergency financial assistance to the millions of Americans who are suffering the economic effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. One source of relief provided by the CARES Act was the authorization of up to $349 billion in forgivable loans to small businesses for job retention and certain other expenses, through the PPP. In April 2020, Congress authorized over $300 billion in additional PPP funding.
The PPP allows qualifying small businesses and other organizations to receive loans with a maturity of two years and an interest rate of one percent.  PPP loan proceeds must be used by businesses on payroll costs, interest on mortgages, rent, and utilities.  The PPP allows the interest and principal to be entirely forgiven if the business spends the loan proceeds on these expense items within a designated time after receiving the proceeds and uses a certain amount of the PPP loan proceeds on payroll expenses.
Anyone with information about allegations of attempted fraud involving COVID-19 can report it by calling the Department of Justice’s National Center for Disaster Fraud Hotline at 866-720-5721 or via the NCDF Web Complaint Form at: https://www.justice.gov/disaster-fraud/ncdf-disaster-complaint-form .

Developer Admits To Working with Bank Executives to Defraud First NBC Bank Out Of Over $123 Million
NEW ORLEANS – The United States Attorney’s Office announced that GARY R. GIBBS (“GIBBS”), age 66, a resident of Niceville, Florida, pled guilty today to conspiracy to defraud First NBC Bank, the New Orleans-based bank that failed in April 2017.
According to court documents, from in or around 2010 through April 2017, GIBBS had a banking relationship with First NBC Bank, individually and through various corporate entities he controlled.  During that time, GIBBS and his entities were regularly unable to pay existing loans or overdrafts on First NBC Bank accounts.  Bank President Ashton Ryan Jr., Chief Credit Officer William Burnell, and Executive Vice President Robert Calloway, who were all charged on July 10 in a 46-count indictment, disguised GIBBS’s and his entities’ true financial condition by making new loans to pay GIBBS’s existing loans and to cover his overdrafts.  They falsely stated in loan documents that GIBBS was able to pay his loans with cash generated by his businesses, and they hid from the First NBC Bank Board of Directors, auditors, and examiners that GIBBS was only making his existing loan payments by getting new loans from First NBC Bank.  Ryan, Burnell, and Calloway hid the fact that they actually made loans to GIBBS to keep him and his entities off of month-end reports to the Board, auditors, and examiners.  These month-end reports listed borrowers who were not paying their loans or whose accounts were overdrawn. By keeping GIBBS and his entities off of those reports, Ryan, Burnell, and Calloway were able to hide their scheme to keep lending to GIBBS despite his inability to pay his loans.
When GIBBS told Ryan and Calloway that he was considering filing bankruptcy or not paying his loans, Ryan told GIBBS that First NBC Bank could not afford for GIBBS to default on the loans.  After that, Ryan, Burnell, and Calloway continued to make false statements and material omissions in loan documents to hide from the Board, auditors, and examiners that the purpose of the new loans was to keep GIBBS and his entities from defaulting and that, in reality, GIBBS was not able to make his payments to the bank without receiving proceeds from new loans.  Neither Ryan nor Calloway ever disclosed to the Board, auditors, or examiners that GIBBS was considering defaulting on his loans or filing bankruptcy, because that would have revealed that GIBBS did not generate enough cash to pay his loans.
To hide their scheme, Ryan directed GIBBS to inflate certain financial statements that GIBBS provided to First NBC Bank, by falsely increasing the income of GIBBS’s entities to hide the amount of money these entities were losing.  Ryan did not tell the Board, auditors, or examiners that GIBBS inflated his financial statements at Ryan’s direction.  Calloway also made false statements to First NBC Bank’s external auditors about GIBBS and his loans.  By the time First NBC Bank failed in April of 2017, GIBBS and his entities owed the bank over $123 million.
“Today’s guilty plea demonstrates the FDIC OIG and our law enforcement partners will not tolerate criminals who defraud our insured financial institutions and cause harm to the nation’s banking industry,” said Laurie Younger, Special Agent in Charge, Dallas Region, Office of Inspector General for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
“The FBI and our law enforcement partners have dedicated significant time and resources toward investigating the failure of FNBC, which resulted in nearly a billion dollar loss to the FDIC. This guilty plea should be a deterrent to others who would attempt to manipulate the nation's banking system,” said Bryan Vorndran, FBI New Orleans Special Agent in Charge.
“We are committed to working with our law enforcement partners in holding accountable wrongdoers whose fraudulent actions materially impact financial institutions regulated and supervised by the Federal Reserve Board,” said Stephen Donnelly, Acting Special Agent in Charge, Eastern Region, Office of Inspector General for the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection.
GIBBS pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Sections 1344 and 1349.  The maximum penalties that may be imposed at sentencing are thirty years in prison; a fine of the greater of twice the gain to GIBBS or twice the loss to any victim; and up to five years of supervised release.
Judge Jane Triche Milazzo set GIBBS’s sentencing for December 2, 2020.
This case is being investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation; the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of Inspector General; and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Office of Inspector General. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Sharan E. Lieberman, Nicholas D. Moses, Matthew R. Payne, and J. Ryan McLaren are in charge of the prosecution.

The complaint alleges that Redfern, through a company called Wilder Effects LLC (Wilder Effects) that he formed in January 2020, fraudulently applied for two EIDLs and a PPP loan between April and June of this year.  The PPP loan application was supported by falsified documents.  The false documentation included a fake IRS filing that purported to be Wilder Effects’ Employer’s Quarterly Federal Tax Return for the first quarter of 2020, showing that the company paid wages to 20 employees, when in reality the IRS has no record of such a filing.  The complaint further alleges that EIDL and PPP loan proceeds were withdrawn in cash or transferred to Redfern’s personal bank account.  As a result of suspected fraud alerts, Wilder Effects’ bank account was frozen and approximately $402,000 of the over $414,000 in EIDL and PPP loan proceeds were recovered.
The CARES Act is a federal law enacted on March 29, 2020, designed to provide emergency financial assistance to the millions of Americans who are suffering the economic effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.  One source of relief provided by the CARES Act was the authorization of up to $349 billion in forgivable loans to small businesses for job retention and certain other expenses, through the PPP.  In April 2020, Congress authorized over $300 billion in additional PPP funding.
The PPP allows qualifying small-businesses and other organizations to receive loans with a maturity of two years and an interest rate of 1 percent.  PPP loan proceeds must be used by businesses on payroll costs, interest on mortgages, rent, and utilities.  The PPP allows the interest and principal on the PPP loan to be forgiven if businesses spend the proceeds on these expenses within a set time period and use at least a certain percentage of the loan towards payroll expenses.
The EIDL program is designed to provide economic relief to small businesses that are currently experiencing a temporary loss of revenue.  EIDL proceeds can be used to cover a wide array of working capital and normal operating expenses, such as continuation of health care benefits, rent, utilities and fixed debt payments.  If an applicant also obtains a loan under the PPP, the EIDL funds cannot be used as the same purpose as the PPP funds.
A criminal complaint is merely an accusation.  A defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.
This case was investigated by TIGTA, FDIC OIG, and IRS CI.  Trial Attorney Jessee Alexander-Hoeppner of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Meredith Ruggles for the Middle District of North Carolina are prosecuting the case.  The Justice Department thanks the SBA OIG for their support and assistance.

St. Paul Man Charged With COVID-Relief Fraud, Money Laundering
United States Attorney Erica H. MacDonald today announced the unsealing of a federal indictment charging KYLE WILLIAM BRENIZER, 32, with fraudulently obtaining $841,000 in Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans intended to provide relief for small businesses affected by COVID-19.[1] The indictment, which was returned under seal on August 19, 2020, charges BRENIZER with two counts of wire fraud and two counts of money laundering. BRENIZER, who was taken into custody earlier today, made his initial appearance before Magistrate Judge Becky R. Thorson in U.S. District Court in St. Paul, Minnesota. BRENIZER was ordered to remain in custody pending a formal detention and arraignment hearing, which is scheduled for Wednesday, August 26.
According to the allegations in the indictment, BRENIZER was the owner and manager of True-Cut Construction LLC (“True-Cut”), a contracting and construction company located in Brooklyn Park, Minnesota. In August 2018, True-Cut and BRENIZER were ordered by the Minnesota Department of Labor and Industry to cease and desist from doing business and in December 2019, True-Cut’s contractor license expired and was never renewed.
According to the allegations in the indictment, on May 1, 2020, BRENIZER submitted a false and misleading PPP application in the name of True-Cut seeking approximately $841,000, but the application was denied. On May 12, 2020, BRENIZER again submitted a false and misleading PPP application in the name of True-Cut seeking approximately $841,000 in PPP funds. This time, in order to conceal his involvement, BRENIZER submitted the application under the name of another individual whom BRENIZER falsely claimed was the 90 percent owner of True-Cut. BRENIZER falsely stated that True-Cut’s average monthly payroll was $336,400 for approximately 30 employees. In support of both loan applications, BRENIZER caused to be submitted to the lender fraudulent supporting documentation, such as falsified bank statements and IRS documents.  In addition, BRENIZER falsely certified that he was not subject to any pending criminal charges even though he was allegedly named in multiple felony charges pending in the State of Minnesota for such charges as check forgery, identify theft, and theft by swindle.  Due to these various misrepresentations and omissions, on May 13, 2020, BRENIZER’s second application was approved, and he received $841,000 in PPP funds.
According to the allegations in the indictment, instead of using the PPP funds for permissible business expenses, BRENIZER transferred approximately $650,000 to a bank account unrelated to True-Cut and made a $29,000 payment to purchase a Harley-Davidson motorcycle, spent over $1,000 on golf expenses, among other retail and entertainment expenditures for his personal benefit.

Philadelphia Cash-Advance Business Owner Indicted and Detained on Weapons Charges
PHILADELPHIA – United States Attorney William M. McSwain announced that Joseph LaForte, 49, of Haverford, PA, was arrested and charged by Indictment with possession of a firearm and ammunition by a convicted felon.
The Indictment alleges that on July 28, 2020, the defendant, a twice-convicted felon, knowingly possessed seven firearms in his home: two shotguns, four loaded handguns, and a loaded rifle.
After the defendant was arrested on August 7, 2020, the Government moved for his detention on the grounds that he was both a risk of flight and a danger to the community. The Government cited, among other things, death threats that LaForte had allegedly made to the customers of his business, Par Funding, a cash advance company based in Philadelphia. After his appearance in federal court yesterday, United States Magistrate Judge Marilyn Heffley detained the defendant until his trial.
“We’re pleased that the Court recognized that no conditions of release would be sufficient here,” said U.S. Attorney McSwain. “Joseph LaForte is where he belongs – in prison – and will now face the consequences of his alleged criminal behavior.”
“Joseph LaForte is a previously convicted felon who continues to demonstrate that he is a threat to the community,” said Michael J. Driscoll, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI’s Philadelphia Division. ""This indictment is just another example of his disregard for the law.”
If convicted, the defendant faces a maximum possible sentence of ten years of imprisonment, a $250,000 fine, 3 years of supervised release, and a $100 special assessment.
The case is being investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation – Office of Inspector General, and the Internal Revenue Service, with assistance from the Lower Merion Township Police and the Pennsylvania State Police Bureau of Criminal Investigations, and is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys Jonathan Ortiz and Patrick J. Murray.
An indictment, information, or criminal complaint is an accusation. A defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.

Arkansas Project Manager Pleads Guilty to Bank Fraud and False Statements in Connection With Covid-Relief Fraud
A project manager employed by a major retailer has pleaded guilty to bank fraud charges for filing fraudulent bank loan applications seeking more than $8 million in forgivable Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (SBA) under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.
Acting Assistant Attorney General Brian C. Rabbitt of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Trent Shores for the Northern District of Oklahoma, Acting Deputy Inspector General Richard Parker of the Federal Housing Finance Agency Office of Inspector General (FHFA OIG), Inspector General Jay N. Lerner of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) OIG and Inspector General Hannibal “Mike” Ware of the SBA OIG made the announcement.
Benjamin Hayford, 32, of Centerton, Arkansas, pleaded guilty to one count of bank fraud and four counts of false statements to a financial institution before U.S. District Judge Claire V. Eagan of the Northern District of Oklahoma.  Sentencing has been scheduled for Nov. 4 before Judge Eagan.
“Stopping COVID-related fraud is a priority for the Department of Justice. Fraudsters like Benjamin Hayford greedily steal money that should be going to America’s small business owners who are struggling during this public health crisis,” said U.S. Attorney Trent Shores. “From coast to coast, U.S. Attorneys and our federal investigative partners will continue to pursue those who would defraud the government by engaging in schemes to steal millions of dollars in forgivable PPP loans by claiming fictitious payroll expenses.”
As part of his guilty plea, Hayford admitted that he sought millions of dollars in forgivable PPP loans from multiple banks by claiming fictitious payroll expenses.  To support his applications, Hayford provided lenders with fraudulent payroll documentation purporting to establish payroll expenses that were, in fact, non-existent.  In addition, Hayford admitted to making false representations to a financial institution concerning the date that a Limited Liability Partnership for which he applied for relief was established.

Former banker and mortgage broker sent to prison for defrauding California bank,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/former-banker-and-mortgage-broker-sent-prison-defrauding,"August 6, 2020",2020,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Former banker and mortgage broker sent to prison for defrauding California bank
HOUSTON –  Two Houston-area family members have been ordered to federal prison following their convictions on multiple counts to include conspiracy, bank fraud, false statements on credit applications, wire fraud and mail fraud, announced U.S. Attorney Ryan K. Patrick.
A federal jury deliberated for approximately seven hours before convicting Carlos Wydler, 49, and Leyla Wydler, 60, both of Houston, on March 7, 2017, following a trial that spanned four weeks.
Today, U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen imposed an 84-month sentence for Carlos Wydler and ordered him to pay $6,804,260 in restitution to the victim bank and its insurer. U.S. District Judge Andrew S. Hanen sentenced his step-mother to 132 months during a telephonic sentencing hearing in June. She was also ordered to pay the $6 million in restitution joint and several with her stepson. At the hearings, the court heard from the bank’s president who testified it was the largest fraud loss in the bank’s 113-year history
“The capture, conviction and sentencing of this mother and stepson highlight the FBI’s unending commitment to hold accountable greedy individuals who take advantage of their position of trust,” said Special Agent in Charge Perrye K. Turner of the FBI. “The FBI prioritizes financial institution fraud because it is not a victimless crime. Although the Wydlers did not wield weapons or threaten tellers, they endangered the stability of the federal banking system and our economy.”
Leyla Wydler was the owner of several Houston-area businesses including Globan Mortgage Company, Casa Milagro and First Milagro. In the spring 2007, Carlos Wydler went to work at a California bank as a vice-president in charge of the bank’s credit card department. Shortly thereafter, the Wydlers developed a scheme in which Leyla Wydler would send credit card applications to the bank for Carlos Wydler to approve. He approved the applications for high credit lines and then, calling them “balance transfers,” cash advanced the entire credit line to the borrower via wire or check with Leyla Wydler taking a fee from the borrowers’ loan proceeds.
“Greed and deception were at the heart of the Wydler’s scheme, which took advantage of their positions of trust within the banking industry,” said Inspector in Charge Adrian Gonzalez of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS). “This case demonstrates that the USPIS remains resolute in our mission to bring to justice those who fraudulently use the nation’s mail system in the furtherance of their deceptive schemes.”
During trial, the evidence demonstrated that the Wydlers were also developing a real estate project in Houston at the time and used the “balance transfer” program to finance investors in their project. The jury heard that the bank did not know or approve of the fee-sharing or real estate financing arrangements.
For approximately a year, hundreds of loan applications were faxed or emailed from Leyla Wydler’s business in Houston to Carlos Wydler at the bank in California. Many of these contained falsified income information and falsified supporting documents about borrowers’ employment, income and assets. Two eyewitnesses testified they saw Leyla Wydler routinely insert falsified income numbers, sometimes using white-out, on loan applications.
Leyla Wydler skimmed more than $1.4 million from loan proceeds, with Carlos Wydler approving approximately $600,000 more in unauthorized loans to family members. More than half of the Texas borrowers run through the Wydler-family business in Houston defaulted on their loans. The bank sustained a loss of more than $6 million.
The defense attempted to convince the jury that Carlos Wydler followed bank policy in his approval decisions. Leyla Wydler’s attorney argued that she did not know that the information she was sending contained falsified information.
The jury did not believe their claims and ultimately convicted both defendants of conspiracy, bank fraud, false statements on credit applications, wire fraud and mail fraud. Carlos Wydler was also found guilty on six counts of misapplication of bank funds.
The Wydlers were taken into custody immediately after the verdict where they will remain pending transfer to a U.S. Bureau of Prisons facility to be determined in the near future.
The FBI, USPIS and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation conducted the investigation. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Belinda Beek and John Lewis prosecuted the case.

Indictment Charges Former Kankakee Wastewater Utilities' Official of $2 Million Fraud,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/indictment-charges-former-kankakee-wastewater-utilities-official,"August 4, 2020",2020,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Indictment Charges Former Kankakee Wastewater Utilities' Official of $2 Million Fraud
Springfield, Ill. – A federal grand jury today returned an indictment that charges Richard G. Simms, 73, currently of Marietta, Ohio, with defrauding Kankakee’s wastewater utilities, Kankakee River Metropolitan Agency (KRMA) and the city’s Environmental Service Utility (ESU), of more than $2 million.
According to the indictment, during the time of the alleged fraud, from 2014 through 2018, Simms served as executive director of KRMA, which was responsible for treating wastewater from its member municipalities, namely, Kankakee, Bradley, Bourbonnais, and Aroma Park, Ill. KRMA also treated wastewater from Manteno and Chebanse, Ill., by intergovernmental agreement. During this period, Simms was also the Superintendent of ESU that serves as Kankakee’s public works and sewer system. At the same time, Simms owned and operated Simms Engineering, LTD.
From 2014 through 2018, Simms received more than $2.5 million in salary and legitimate payments: approximately $1,124,288 from KRMA and approximately $1,594,585 from ESU. In addition, and independent of his salary and payments, the indictment alleges that Simms fraudulently received approximately $2.2 million - $768,000 from KRMA and $1,257,000 from ESU - as payment to Simms Engineering for software development by Plum Flower International. Simms and his daughter registered Plum Flower International with the State of Illinois in March 2014 purportedly to develop a software application for medical companies to track medical records.
The indictment alleges that although Simms did not have board approval or contracts with his engineering firm to develop software, he submitted fraudulent and inflated invoices to KRMA and ESU for software development. Simms allegedly circumvented KRMA’s invoice payment procedure by submitting invoices directly to its accounting firm. As a result, KRMA’s superintendent and administrative assistant did not approve and were unaware of the invoices.
From May 2014 through September 2018, Simms Engineering allegedly transferred more than $2 million to Plum Flower International, which represented more than 95% of its revenue during this time frame. Plum Flower International allegedly used approximately $161,000 of the funds to pay another company to create a software application which they attempted to sell on the open market. The remaining funds were allegedly used for the personal benefit of Simms and his daughter, the owners of Plum Flower International.
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General conducted the investigation. Assistant U.S. Attorney Eugene L. Miller is representing the government in the case prosecution.
The U.S. Clerk of the Court will set the date for Simms to appear in federal court in Urbana for arraignment.
If convicted, the offense of federal program fraud carries a maximum statutory penalty of 10 years in prison.
Members of the public are reminded that an indictment is merely an accusation; the defendant is presumed innocent unless proven guilty.

Boulder Man Pleads Guilty To Nearly $32 Million Bank Fraud Scheme
Michael Scott Leslie engaged in identity theft to obtain funds for fraudulent mortgages
DENVER – United States Attorney Jason R. Dunn announced today that Michael Scott Leslie, age 57, of Boulder, Colorado, pleaded guilty to federal bank fraud and aggravated identity theft charges.  Leslie appeared remotely on a $50,000 unsecured bond, which was continued at the hearing’s conclusion.  The Denver office of the FBI, and the Offices of the Inspector General for both the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) joined in today’s announcement.
According to the stipulated facts contained in Leslie’s plea agreement, Leslie owned, operated, or otherwise had an interest in several business entities, some of which were operated out of Colorado.  These entities were involved in or affiliated with financing or originating residential mortgage loans.  Through these business entities, Leslie sold residential mortgage loans to investors, including an FDIC-insured bank in Texas (“the victim bank”).
Between October 2015 and October 2017, Leslie devised and executed a scheme to defraud the victim bank by selling it 144 fraudulent residential mortgage loans valued at $31,908,806.88.  These loans were purportedly originated by one of Leslie’s companies, Montage Mortgage, and “closed”  by Snowberry, which earned fees for the closing.  The loans were then presented and sold to the victim bank until Montage identified a final investor.  For these 144 fraudulent loans, that final investor was Mortgage Capital Management (MCM).
Leslie never disclosed to the victim bank that he operated MCM and Snowberry, or the fact that sales to investor MCM, even if they had been real, were not arms-length transactions.
The 144 residential mortgage loans sold to the victim bank were not, in fact, real loans.  The borrowers listed on these 144 fraudulent loans were real individuals, but they had no idea that their identities had been used as part of the sale of the fraudulent loans. The defendant had access to their personal identifying information in one of two primary ways:  (1) the borrowers had used Montage for legitimate residential real estate transactions which were properly executed and closed, or (2) the borrowers had been solicited by Montage about refinancing their existing loans.  In the case of refinance transactions, Montage secured permission from the borrowers to request credit scores and history from the major credit agencies.  After receipt of those credit scores, Montage often told these would-be refinance borrowers that they did not qualify for a refinance.  Leslie then recycled the borrowers’ information, obtained through prior legitimate transactions or attempted refinances, to create and sell nearly $32 million of fraudulent loan packages.
To execute this scheme, Leslie forged signatures on closing documents and fabricated and altered credit reports as well as title documents, often by using the names of legitimate companies.  The fraudulent real estate transactions were never filed with the respective counties in which the properties were located, there were no closings, and no liens were ever recorded.  Through numerous bank accounts for the various business entities and his personal accounts, the defendant used money in a Ponzi-like fashion from prior fraudulent loans sold to the victim bank to fund future fraudulent loans.  This complex flow of money continued until the defendant’s fraud was detected.  When the fraud was discovered, the victim bank still had 12 fraudulent loans, valued at $3,887,505.93, on its books that it could not, given that the loans did not exist, sell to any other legitimate third-party investor.
Chief U.S. District Court Judge Philip A. Brimmer presided over the change of plea hearing today, July 31, 2020.  Leslie was first charged by information on June 5, 2020.  This case was investigated by the Denver office of the FBI, and the Offices of the Inspector General for both the Housing and Urban Development and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.  The defendant was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Hetal J. Doshi and Jeremy Sibert.

Former President of Cecil Bank Pleads Guilty to Federal Charges in Maryland of Bank Fraud Conspiracy, Receiving a Bribe, and Making False Statements in Bank Records
Baltimore, Maryland – The former President and Chief Executive Officer of Cecil Bank, Mary Beyer Halsey, age 59, of Rising Sun, Maryland, pleaded guilty today to the federal charges of conspiracy to commit bank fraud, receipt of a bribe by a bank official, and false statement in bank records, in connection with the straw purchase of a home in Rising Sun, Maryland, upon which Cecil Bank had foreclosed.
The guilty plea was announced by United States Attorney for the District of Maryland Robert K. Hur; Special Agent in Charge Mark P. Higgins of Federal Housing Finance Agency, Office of Inspector General (FHFA-OIG), Mid-Atlantic Region; Special Agent in Charge Patricia Tarasca of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of Inspector General (FDIC/OIG), New York Region; Special Inspector General Christy Goldsmith Romero for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (SIGTARP); and Inspector General Hannibal “Mike” Ware of the Small Business Administration, Office of Inspector General (SBA/OIG).
“Mary Beyer Halsey used her position as President and CEO of Cecil Bank for her personal benefit, causing a loss to the bank, which had already received federal taxpayer funds as part of the Troubled Asset Relief Program,” said U.S. Attorney Robert K. Hur.  “Corrupt bank officials undermine the public’s trust in our financial system.”
“The Federal Housing Finance Agency Office of Inspector General (FHFA-OIG) is committed to investigating allegations of fraud committed by officers of financial institutions which are members of the 11 Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBanks) because their crimes strike at the heart of the FHLBank System,” said Mark Higgins, Special Agent in Charge of the FHFA-OIG’s Mid-Atlantic Region. “We are proud to have partnered with the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Maryland on this case.”
“This plea illustrates the tremendous harm bank insiders can cause when they use their positions for personal gain, breaking the trust placed in them by their employees, shareholders, and customers,” said Patricia Tarasca, Special Agent in Charge, New York Region, Office of Inspector General for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.  “We thank our law enforcement partners and appreciate the cooperation between investigating agencies.”
“Today, another bank CEO pleads guilty to committing fraud against the bank while the bank was in TARP,” said Special Inspector General Christy Goldsmith Romero.  “Cecil Bank CEO Halsey pled guilty to conspiracy to commit bank fraud, making false statements in bank records, and receiving a bribe in a fraud that caused losses to Cecil Bank.  Taxpayers lost nearly $11 million in TARP when Cecil Bank failed.  SIGTARP commends U.S. Attorney Robert Hur and his team for fighting financial fraud related to TARP.”
“OIG and its law enforcement partners are poised to root out fraud and bring wrongdoers to justice,” said SBA Inspector General Hannibal “Mike” Ware. “I want to thank the U.S. Attorney’s Office and our law enforcement partners for their dedication and pursuit of justice.”
Cecil Bank, located in Elkton, Maryland, had received $11,560,000 in federal taxpayer funds in 2008, under the Capital Purchase Program, as part of the Troubled Asset Relief Program.  On April 20, 2011, Cecil Bank initiated the foreclosure of a single-family house located at 127 Ebenezer Church Road in Rising Sun.
According to her plea agreement, from 2012 to 2013, Halsey conspired with Daniel Whitehurst, an employee of a real estate development company that did business in Maryland, to defraud Cecil Bank and another bank to purchase a home through false pretenses, representations and promises.  Specifically, on March 28, 2012, Halsey and Whitehurst met at a restaurant in Cecil County.  Whitehurst asked Halsey if she could help him and a business partner get a $500,000 line of credit from Cecil Bank.  Halsey agreed to help Whitehurst to obtain a line of credit from Cecil Bank, in exchange for Whitehurst agreeing to serve as the straw purchaser of 127 Ebenezer on behalf of Halsey.  Halsey suggested that she increase the line of credit for Whitehurst to $650,000 to include the funds needed to buy the house.  Whitehurst agreed to Halsey’s request to secretly buy 127 Ebenezer on Halsey’s behalf.  On May 9, 2012, Halsey participated in a loan committee meeting at Cecil Bank that considered and approved a $650,000 line for credit for Whitehurst and a $500,000 line of credit for his business partner.
Halsey admitted that at her request, on May 14, 2012, Whitehurst visited 127 Ebenezer and provided Halsey with an estimate of the costs to update the house.  Whitehurst determined that beyond replacing the kitchen subflooring at a cost of about $1,000, there were no significant repairs needed.  Whitehurst provided a letter of intent to purchase the home from the bank for $150,000 for Halsey to review.  Halsey suggested lowering the price to $145,000 to allow room to increase the offer later.  Halsey knew that an exterior-only appraisal of the property ordered by Cecil Bank on November 9, 2011, showed a market value of $263,000.  A full appraisal on September 10, 2012, reflected a market value of $295,000.  To support the below-market price that Halsey wanted to pay, Whitehurst included in the letter of intent a list of lower-priced home sales in the same area that were not comparable to 127 Ebenezer and therefore was not reflective of the property’s actual market value.
As detailed in the plea agreement, on May 23, 2012, Whitehurst e-mailed Cecil Bank his offer to purchase 127 Ebenezer for $145,000.  On the same day, during a meeting of the Cecil Bank Board of Directors, Halsey advised the Board that Whitehurst had made a purchase offer of $140,000 for 127 Ebenezer, $5,000 less the actual offer.  To support the below-market price of $140,000, Halsey falsely characterized the property as having “structural deficiencies [that] will require significant repairs.”  Halsey did not disclose her personal interest in the property, nor Whitehurst’s role as her nominee to acquire the property on her behalf.  The Board authorized Halsey to “negotiate the best price.”  Thereafter, Whitehurst submitted a contract for him to purchase 127 Ebenezer from Cecil Bank for $150,000, which Halsey signed on August 17, 2012 on behalf of Cecil Bank.
According to the plea agreement, subsequent to authorizing the sale of 127 Ebenezer, Halsey told Whitehurst that he should not use his line of credit from Cecil Bank to purchase the house, but should instead get the funds from a different source.  Whitehurst applied for and obtained a $100,000 loan from another bank to purchase 127 Ebenezer, fraudulently claiming that he was purchasing the property for himself and that the down payment was from an investment account.  On October 31, 2012, prior to 127 Ebenezer going to settlement, Halsey wired $75,000 to Whitehurst’s bank account to cover the cost of the down payment as well as closing costs and upgrades to the property that Halsey directed Whitehurst to arrange.  To conceal the true purpose of the wired funds, Whitehurst sent Halsey a fictitious real estate contract purporting to show that the $75,000 was the down payment for a different property that Whitehurst owned in Havre de Grace, Maryland.
On November 21, 2012, the settlement of 127 Ebenezer was held with Halsey representing Cecil Bank as the seller, and Whitehurst as the purported purchaser, selling the property to Whitehurst for $150,000.  Both signed the HUD-1 form which falsely represented that Whitehurst had paid approximately $52,566 at settlement, when in fact, the down payment and all related closing costs were paid from the $75,000 Halsey had wired to Whitehurst’s bank account beforehand.  From October 31, 2012 through March 29, 2013, Halsey transferred an additional $60,000 to Whitehurst to cover the cost the upgrades to the house that they had previously discussed, as well as to reimburse Whitehurst for mortgage payments he made on the property.  Halsey and Whitehurst also made plans to transfer title of the property to Halsey by selling the house to her at a price that would minimize the tax consequences of the sale for Whitehurst.
In December 2012, in response to a question from a bank examiner for the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond inquiring about the sale of the property to Whitehurst, Halsey falsely stated that she was “not totally familiar with [that] property” and that the bank had difficulty marketing the property and had not listed it with a realtor because of “issues with the county over the bonds outstanding.”
In April 2013, federal agents began interviewing employees and other borrowers about banking irregularities at Cecil Bank.  Title to 127 Ebenezer was never transferred to Halsey.  Halsey never told the bank that she was the true purchaser of 127 Ebenezer, nor did the bank know that Halsey and Whitehurst had orchestrated the sale of the foreclosed property at the fraudulent price of $150,000, instead of the appraised pre-renovation price of $295,000.
As a result of Halsey’s misrepresentations and omissions, the bank lost approximately $145,000.
Halsey faces a maximum sentence of 30 years in federal prison for each offense: conspiracy to commit bank fraud; false statement in bank records; and receipt of a bribe by a bank official.  Actual sentences for federal crimes are typically less than the maximum penalties.  A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after taking into account the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.  U.S. District Judge Deborah K. Chasanow has scheduled sentencing for November 6, 2020 at 11:00 a.m.
Daniel Whitehurst, age 36, of Bel Air, Maryland, pleaded guilty under seal to the federal charge of mail fraud on April 6, 2018.  Whitehurst faces a maximum sentence of 30 years in federal prison for conspiracy to commit bank fraud.  Judge Chasanow has not scheduled a date for Whitehurst’s sentencing.
United States Attorney Robert K. Hur commended the FHFA-OIG, Mid-Atlantic Region; FDIC/OIG; SIGTARP; and SBA/OIG for their work in the investigation.  Mr. Hur thanked Assistant U.S. Attorneys Martin J. Clarke and Harry M. Gruber, who are prosecuting the case.

Seventh Conspirator Pleads Guilty to Participation in the DC Solar Ponzi Scheme Involving $2.5B in Transactions and Nearly $1B in Loss,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/seventh-conspirator-pleads-guilty-participation-dc-solar-ponzi,"July 28, 2020",2020,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Seventh Conspirator Pleads Guilty to Participation in the DC Solar Ponzi Scheme Involving $2.5B in Transactions and Nearly $1B in Loss
SACRAMENTO, Calif. — Alan Hansen, 49, of Vacaville, pleaded guilty Tuesday to his participation in a massive fraud scheme through DC Solar, a solar energy company in Benicia formerly owned and operated by Jeff and Paulette Carpoff, that defrauded investors of approximately $1 billion, U.S. Attorney McGregor W. Scott announced.
Those losses resulted from investment transactions in solar energy hardware valued at approximately $2.5 billion. Hansen also pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting money laundering. Hansen is the seventh person to plead guilty to federal criminal charges relating to the fraud scheme since October 2019. The Carpoffs pleaded guilty to their roles in the fraud conspiracy and other charges in January 2020.
According to court documents, between 2011 and 2018, DC Solar manufactured mobile solar generator units (MSG), solar generators that were mounted on trailers. The company touted the versatility and environmental sustainability of the mobile solar generators and claimed that they were used to provide emergency power to cellphone towers and lighting at sporting and other events. The Carpoffs and their co-conspirators solicited investors by claiming that there were favorable federal tax benefits associated with investments in alternative energy. The conspirators pulled off their scheme by selling solar generators that did not exist to investors, making it appear that solar generators existed in locations that they did not, creating false financial statements, and obtaining false lease contracts, among other efforts to conceal the fraud. In reality, at least half of the approximately 17,000 solar generators claimed to have been manufactured by DC Solar did not exist and DC Solar paid early investors with funds contributed by later investors.
According to court documents, Hansen was an employee of a telecom company with which DC Solar had done business and executed certain contracts. In that role, Hansen accepted $1 million from co-conspirators at DC Solar to fraudulently sign a false contract those co‑conspirators later used to induce investments by victims. Thereafter, Hansen took a job at DC Solar at a significant pay increase and left his former employment. Later, as a DC Solar executive, Hansen and a co-conspirator agreed to share $20,000 to sign a false contract related to the earlier agreement, using a fake name. The conspirators also used that false contract to induce an investment by victims. Hansen was paid for signing the first false contract through a series of interstate wire transfers into an account he set up in the name of a consulting company. Hansen knew the money he was paid came from payments by DC Solar investors, and that DC Solar was deceiving them to induce those payments. Nevertheless, Hansen provided a co-conspirator with information to complete those wire transfers, intending to commit money laundering.
Joseph W. Bayliss, 44, of Martinez, and Ronald J. Roach, of Walnut Creek, each pleaded guilty to related charges on Oct. 22, 2019. Robert A. Karmann, 53, of Clayton, pleaded guilty to related charges on Dec. 17, 2019. Ryan Guidry, 53, of Pleasant Hill, pleaded guilty to related charges on Jan. 14. Jeff and Paulette Carpoff pleaded guilty to related charges on Jan. 24 and are scheduled for sentencing on Nov. 10. The investigation into the fraud remains ongoing.
This case is the product of an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, IRS‑Criminal Investigation, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General. Assistant U.S. Attorneys André M. Espinosa and Kevin C. Khasigian are prosecuting the case.
Hansen is scheduled to be sentenced by U.S. District Judge John A. Mendez on Nov. 3. Hansen faces a maximum statutory penalty of 15 years in prison. The actual sentence, however, will be determined at the discretion of the court after consideration of any applicable statutory factors and the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, which take into account a number of variables.

David T. Hines, 29, of Miami, Florida, was charged by criminal complaint, unsealed today upon his initial appearance before U.S. Chief Magistrate Judge John J. O’Sullivan in the Southern District of Florida, with one count of bank fraud, one count of making false statements to a financial institution and one count of engaging in transactions in unlawful proceeds.
The complaint alleges that Hines sought approximately $13.5 million in PPP loans through applications to an insured financial institution on behalf of different companies.  The complaint alleges that Hines caused to be submitted fraudulent loan applications that made numerous false and misleading statements about the companies’ respective payroll expenses.  The financial institution approved and funded approximately $3.9 million in loans.

Rabbitt at of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division and U.S. Attorney Brian T. Moran of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Washington.
Mukund Mohan, 48, of Clyde Hill, Washington, was charged by criminal complaint, unsealed today after he was taken into custody, in the Western District of Washington with one count of wire fraud and one count of money laundering.  He is expected to make his initial appearance before U.S. Chief Magistrate Judge Brian A.

According to the indictment, Buoi is the president and CEO of an information technology services company, Sosuda Tech, LLC. Between April 2020 and June 2020, Buoi allegedly submitted fraudulent applications for over $13 million in PPP loans through SBA-approved lenders.

Three First NBC Executives Indicted For Fraud against Failed $5 Billion Bank,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/three-first-nbc-executives-indicted-fraud-against-failed-5,"July 10, 2020",2020,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Three First NBC Executives Indicted For Fraud against Failed $5 Billion Bank
NEW ORLEANS – The United States Attorney’s Office announced that a grand jury indicted ASHTON J. RYAN, age 72, of Kenner; WILLIAM BURNELL, age 70, of Kenner; ROBERT BRAD CALLOWAY, age 60, of Metairie; and FRANK J. ADOLPH, age 60, of Kenner, for defrauding First NBC Bank, the New Orleans-based bank that failed in April 2017.
According to the 46-count Indictment, from 2006 through April 2017, RYAN, BURNELL, CALLOWAY, and ADOLPH conspired to defraud First NBC Bank (the “Bank”) through a variety of schemes. RYAN was the President and CEO of the Bank for most of its existence. BURNELL was the Chief Credit Officer. CALLOWAY was an Executive Vice President. ADOLPH was a borrower at the Bank who was charged with conspiring with the three Bank executives to obtain loans based on false statements and forged documents.
The Indictment alleges that RYAN, BURNELL, CALLOWAY, ADOLPH, and others conspired to defraud First NBC Bank by disguising the true financial status of certain borrowers and their troubled loans, concealing the true financial condition of the Bank from the Board, auditors, and examiners. The borrowers included real estate developer Gary Gibbs, real estate developer Kenneth Charity, Bank general counsel Gregory St. Angelo, factoring business owner FRANK ADOLPH, hotel owner Arvind “Mike” Vira, contractor Warren Treme, and contractor Jeffrey Dunlap. CALLOWAY was Gibbs’s loan officer, and RYAN served as the loan officer or oversaw the loan officers for all of those borrowers. BURNELL approved the risk rating for all of these borrowers’ loans and was the gatekeeper tasked with protecting the safety and soundness of the Bank’s loan portfolio. Dunlap, Charity, and St. Angelo have previously been charged in individual Bills of Information with conspiracy to commit bank fraud, and all three have pled guilty. Vira, Gibbs, and Treme have been charged more recently, in their own individual Bills of Information, with conspiring to defraud First NBC Bank. All six of these borrowers are listed in the Indictment as members of the bank fraud conspiracy with RYAN, BURNELL, CALLOWAY, and ADOLPH.
During the course of the conspiracy, RYAN, BURNELL, and CALLOWAY repeatedly extended loans to borrowers who were unable to pay their loans without relying on loan payments to keep them current. To hide this practice, RYAN, BURNELL, and CALLOWAY made false statements in loan documents and elsewhere about the purposes of loans, the borrowers’ abilities to repay those loans, and the sources of funds used to pay those loans. When the borrowers were unable to pay those loans, RYAN, BURNELL, and CALLOWAY made new loans to these same borrowers and then used the proceeds from those new loans to pay the existing loans. This created the false impression that the borrowers were able to pay their loans, when in fact they would not have been able to pay their loans without going further into debt through new borrowing from the Bank. The new loans prevented these borrowers from appearing on lists that RYAN and BURNELL gave the Bank’s Board each month, which would have highlighted that the borrowers were unable to make loan payments or had cash flow problems. RYAN, BURNELL, and CALLOWAY also made false statements about the purpose of those loans, misrepresenting in Bank documents that the borrowers were able to pay loans with cash generated from the borrowers’ businesses, when in fact the borrowers were only able to pay those loans with proceeds from new Bank loans. The borrowers often spent the proceeds of these business loans on unrelated personal expenses, including by overdrawing their checking accounts at the Bank, and RYAN, BURNELL, and CALLOWAY paid these overdrafts by issuing new loans to the borrowers. This practice kept the borrowers off of month-end overdraft reports to the Board and hid the borrowers’ inability to pay their own expenses without new loan proceeds.
For certain loans, RYAN, BURNELL, and CALLOWAY included borrower documents in loan files despite knowing that the documents were false. For example, even after RYAN and BURNELL learned that ADOLPH was submitting falsified documents to the Bank to inflate his collateral, RYAN and BURNELL continued to submit loans for ADOLPH that included the false documents. Similarly, even though RYAN, BURNELL, and CALLOWAY knew that Gibbs could not pay his loans with cash generated from his businesses, they continued to submit loan documents that included false documents showing that Gibbs’s business earned enough cash to pay his loans at the Bank.
When members of the Board or the Bank’s outside auditors or examiners asked about loans to these borrowers, RYAN, BURNELL, and CALLOWAY made false statements about the borrowers and their loans, and left out the truth about the borrowers’ inability to pay their debts without getting new loans. As a result, the balance on these borrowers’ loans continued to grow. By the time regulators closed First NBC Bank in April of 2017, Gibbs owed the Bank $123 million; Charity owed $18 million; St. Angelo owed $46 million; ADOLPH owed $6 million; Vira owed $39 million; Treme owed $6 million; and Dunlap owed $22 million. The Bank’s failure cost the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation deposit insurance fund just under $1 billion.
RYAN, BURNELL, and CALLOWAY each received millions of dollars in compensation from the Bank during the course of the conspiracy. RYAN also received personal benefits from three of the borrower relationships. Vira lent millions of dollars to RYAN at the same time Vira was a borrower at the Bank, and RYAN and Vira conspired to hide their business dealings from the Board, auditors, and examiners. Treme was RYAN’s partner in several businesses and real estate development projects, and RYAN used Treme’s borrowing from the Bank as a way to spend Bank loan proceeds on RYAN’s own projects. Even when parts of RYAN’s business dealings with Vira and Treme were revealed to regulators, RYAN continued to conceal from regulators that he exercised authority over loans to Vira and Treme. Dunlap was a contractor for a business that RYAN and Treme ran, and RYAN used loan proceeds from Dunlap’s business to benefit his own development project, Wadsworth Estates. RYAN never disclosed his business relationship with Dunlap to the Board, auditors, or examiners. BURNELL was aware of this business relationship and also never disclosed it to the Board, auditors, or examiners.
“Along with our partners, the FBI has dedicated significant time and resources toward investigating the failure of First NBC Bank, which resulted in nearly a billion dollar loss to the FDIC,” stated FBI New Orleans Special Agent in Charge Bryan Vorndran. “This should be a deterrent for others interested in participating in fraudulent schemes that affect our financial system.”
“Today’s indictment sends a clear message that bank executives who engage in fraud that impacts the safety and soundness of financial institutions will be held accountable for their actions,” said Stephen Donnelly, Acting Special Agent in Charge, Eastern Region, Office of Inspector General for the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection.
“This indictment is the product of a complex investigation involving multiple agencies over a long period,” said Laurie Younger, Special Agent in Charge, Dallas Region, Office of Inspector General for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.  “It sends an important message to those who would attempt to unlawfully manipulate the nation’s banking system.”
RYAN, BURNELL, CALLOWAY, and ADOLPH are each charged in Count 1 of the Indictment with conspiracy to commit bank fraud, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Sections 1344 and 1349. RYAN, BURNELL, CALLOWAY, and ADOLPH are also charged with multiple instances of bank fraud, as listed in Counts 2 through 37, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1344. RYAN, BURNELL, and CALLOWAY are charged with making false entries in bank records, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1005, as listed in Counts 38 through 46. For each of the charged counts, the maximum penalties that may be imposed upon conviction are thirty years in prison; a fine of $1,000,000, or the greater of twice the gain to a defendant or twice the loss to any victim; up to five years of supervised release; and a $100 mandatory special assessment.
The United States Attorney’s Office stated that an Indictment is merely an accusation and that the guilt of the defendants must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.
This case is being investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation; the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of Inspector General; and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Office of Inspector General. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Sharan E. Lieberman, Matthew R. Payne, Nicholas D. Moses, and J. Ryan McLaren are in charge of the prosecution.

North Suburban Man Charged in Federal Court With Illegal Sports Bookmaking and Tax Offenses
CHICAGO — The U.S. Attorney’s Office in Chicago today charged a north suburban man with illegal sports bookmaking and filing a false federal income tax return.
From 2014 to 2018, DOMINIC POETA, 63, of Highland Park, unlawfully operated a business that provided sports betting and wagering services, both domestically and abroad, according to a criminal information filed in U.S. District Court in Chicago.  The information also charges Poeta with filing a false federal income tax return for the calendar year 2016 that falsely reported his total income was $81,609, knowing his actual income substantially exceeded that amount.
Poeta will be arraigned in federal court in Chicago on a future date to be set by the Court.
The information was announced by John R. Lausch, Jr., United States Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois; Kathy A. Enstrom, Special Agent-in-Charge of the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation Division in Chicago; and John Crawford, Special Agent-in-Charge of the Chicago Regional Office of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of Inspector General.   The government is represented by Assistant U.S. Attorney Patrick King.
The public is reminded that an information is not evidence of guilt.  The defendant is presumed innocent and entitled to a fair trial at which the government has the burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.
The tax charge is punishable by up to three years in federal prison, while the bookmaking charge is punishable by up to two years.  If convicted, the Court must impose a reasonable sentence under federal statutes and the advisory U.S. Sentencing Guidelines.

Developer Charged With Conspiracy to Defraud First NBC Bank over $6 Million,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/developer-charged-conspiracy-defraud-first-nbc-bank-over-6,"July 9, 2020",2020,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Developer Charged With Conspiracy to Defraud First NBC Bank over $6 Million
NEW ORLEANS – The United States Attorney’s Office announced that WARREN G. TREME (“TREME”), age 55, a resident of Metairie, Louisiana, was charged July 8, 2020 with conspiracy to defraud First NBC Bank, the New Orleans-based bank that failed in April 2017.
According to the Bill of Information, from in or around 2008 through April 2017, TREME had a banking relationship with First NBC Bank, individually and through various entities he controlled. TREME also co-owned several entities with Bank President A. Because of this conflict of interest, Bank President A should not have been involved with TREME’s loans. However, Bank President A exercised authority over TREME’s loans with Bank Officer B. Throughout his borrowing relationship at First NBC Bank, TREME lacked sufficient income and cash flow from his businesses to pay his loans and personal expenses. Bank President A and Bank Officer B disguised TREME’s true financial condition by making new loans to pay TREME’s existing loans.
The Bill of Information further describes a scheme by Bank President A and Bank Officer B to take $400,000 from TREME’s business partners as part of a settlement. Rather than using the $400,000 to pay down an outstanding loan debt owed by TREME and his business partners, Bank President A and Bank Officer B gave $300,000 to TREME. TREME spent the money on gambling, a trip to the Caribbean, and expenses related to a real estate development company TREME co-owned with Bank President A. During a subsequent Board meeting, Bank President A and Bank Officer B falsely stated that the $300,000 was used to pay down the outstanding loan debt owed by TREME and his business partners.
TREME is charged in the Bill of Information with one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Sections 1344 and 1349.  The maximum penalties that may be imposed upon conviction are thirty years in prison; a fine of $1,000,000, or the greater of twice the gain to TREME or twice the loss to any victim; up to five years of supervised release; and a $100 mandatory special assessment.
The United States Attorney’s Office stated that a Bill of Information is merely an accusation and that the guilt of the defendant must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.
This case is being investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation; the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of Inspector General; and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Office of Inspector General. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Sharan E. Lieberman, Nicholas D. Moses, Matthew R. Payne, and J. Ryan McLaren are in charge of the prosecution.

Former Bank Executive Sentenced For Using Bank Funds For Luxury Vacations and Other Personal Expenses,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/former-bank-executive-sentenced-using-bank-funds-luxury,"July 9, 2020",2020,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Thursday, July 9, 2020
United States Attorney Matthew D. Krueger announced that on July 8, 2020, Archie G. Overby (age 71; formerly of Waupaca, Wisconsin, and currently of Parker, Texas) was sentenced in federal court following his guilty plea to misapplication of funds by a bank officer, in violation of Title 18 United States Code, Section 656.
According to court filings, Overby had been the President, Chief Operating Officer, and Chairman of the Board of First National Bank in Waupaca.  Pursuant to a plea agreement, Overby admitted that starting by 2010 and continuing through 2013, he caused the bank to pay for $1.6 million in travel, entertainment, and other personal expenses for himself, family members, friends, and associates, all of which had no legitimate banking purpose. The expenses included airfare, lodging, and a climbing expedition to Mt. Kilimanjaro, Tanzania, as well as stays at a spa in Arizona and in villas in St. Maarten.
The criminal case followed a civil action by the Office of the Comptroller of Currency (OCC), the bank’s federal regulator. That case, which Overby settled in 2017, resulted in his lifetime prohibition from participation in the financial institution industry, and his agreement to pay $1.6 million in restitution and a $100,000 civil money penalty. After the settlement, however, Overby released a statement asserting that he had admitted no wrongdoing and “never would.” He described the regulator as “overzealous,” claimed to be the victim, and alleged that the regulator improperly had sought to “tarnish his reputation.”  As part of his guilty plea, Overby acknowledged not only his criminal conduct but also that the OCC had acted properly and within the bounds of its authority.
Pursuant to the plea agreement accepted by the Court, Senior United States District Court Judge William C. Griesbach did not impose a prison sentence.
Instead, because of Overby’s age and documented and significant health issues, and the potential impact of COVID-19, Judge Griesbach ordered Overby to pay $1.6 million in restitution and forfeit $146,023.35 to the United States.
Judge Griesbach noted that Overby’s criminal conduct, which had gone on for years, was serious and hard to understand, particularly in light of the fact that Overby had been “so well compensated.”  Judge Griesbach concluded that it was a betrayal of trust that could only be attributed to “greed and callous disregard for others.”  Judge Griesbach explained that “in ordinary circumstances, this case would call for a guideline prison sentence.”  However, Judge Griesbach found that due to Overby’s age and demonstrated health issues, exposure to COVID-19 in prison could amount to a death sentence.  As such, Judge Griesbach accepted the recommendation that Overby receive a non-custodial sentence.
United States Attorney Krueger stated, “This case serves as an example that professionals who abuse their positions of trust will be held accountable.  For years, Archie Overby used his position and authority to treat himself and his family to lavish vacations and to use the financial institution he oversaw as his personal piggy bank.  When caught, he tried to portray himself as a victim.  I commend the determined work of the regulators and the criminal investigators in bringing Mr. Overby to justice.”
Special Agent in Charge John T. Crawford, FDIC Office of Inspector General, Chicago Region stated “Overby’s guilty plea and sentencing should serve as a warning to others who take advantage of the financial institution industry.  Regulators are put in place to monitor the financial industry and law enforcement is at the ready to assist when fraudster’s take advantage of the industry.  In this case, our Office, the regulators, and the USAO worked to together to ensure Overby took responsibility for his actions, paid for his actions, and can no longer be in a position to commit further financial institution fraud.”
This case was investigated by Special Agents of the Federal Deposit Corporation-Office of Inspector General and United States Department of Treasury-Office of Inspector General.
The case was prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Carol L. Kraft.

Developer Charged With Conspiracy to Defraud First NBC Bank Out Of Over $123 Million
NEW ORLEANS – The United States Attorney’s Office announced that GARY R. GIBBS (“GIBBS”), age 66, a resident of Niceville, Florida, was charged today with conspiracy to defraud First NBC Bank, the New Orleans-based bank that failed in April 2017.
According to the Bill of Information, from in or around 2010 through April 2017, GIBBS had a banking relationship with First NBC Bank, individually and through various corporate entities he controlled.  During that time, GIBBS and his entities were regularly unable to pay existing loans or overdrafts on First NBC Bank accounts.  Bank President A, Bank Officer B, and Bank Officer C disguised GIBBS’s and his entities’ true financial condition by making new loans to pay GIBBS’s existing loans and to cover his overdrafts.  They falsely stated in loan documents that GIBBS was able to pay his loans with cash generated by his businesses, and they hid from the First NBC Bank Board of Directors, auditors, and examiners that GIBBS was only making his existing loan payments by getting new loans from First NBC Bank.  Bank President A, Bank Officer B, and Bank Officer C hid the fact that they actually made loans to GIBBS to keep him and his entities off of month-end reports to the Board, auditors, and examiners.  These month-end reports listed borrowers who were not paying their loans or whose accounts were overdrawn. By keeping GIBBS and his entities off of those reports, Bank President A, Bank Officer B, and Bank Officer C were able to hide their scheme to keep lending to GIBBS despite his inability to pay his loans.
When GIBBS told Bank President A and Bank Officer C that he was considering filing bankruptcy or not paying his loans, Bank President A told GIBBS that First NBC Bank could not afford for GIBBS to default on the loans.  After that, Bank President A and Bank Officer C continued to make false statements and material omissions in loan documents to hide from the Board, auditors, and examiners that the purpose of the new loans was to keep GIBBS and his entities from defaulting and that, in reality, GIBBS was not able to make his payments to the bank without receiving proceeds from new loans.  Neither Bank President A nor Bank Officer C ever disclosed to the Board, auditors, or examiners that GIBBS was considering defaulting on his loans or filing bankruptcy, because that would have revealed that GIBBS did not generate enough cash to pay his loans.
To hide their scheme, Bank President A directed GIBBS to inflate certain financial statements that GIBBS provided to First NBC Bank, by falsely increasing the income of GIBBS’s entities to hide the amount of money these entities were losing.  Bank President A did not tell the Board, auditors, or examiners that GIBBS inflated his financial statements at Bank President A’s direction.  Bank Officer C also made false statements to First NBC Bank’s external auditors about GIBBS and the GIBBS loans.  By the time First NBC Bank failed in April of 2017, GIBBS and his entities owed the bank over $123 million.
GIBBS is charged in the Bill of Information with one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Sections 1344 and 1349.  The maximum penalties that may be imposed upon conviction are thirty years in prison; a fine of $250,000, or the greater of twice the gain to GIBBS or twice the loss to any victim; up to five years of supervised release; and a $100 mandatory special assessment.
The United States Attorney’s Office stated that a Bill of Information is merely an accusation and that the guilt of the defendant must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.
This case is being investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation; the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of Inspector General; and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Office of Inspector General. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Sharan E. Lieberman, Nicholas D. Moses, Matthew R. Payne, and J. Ryan McLaren are in charge of the prosecution.

Seattle Doctor Charged with COVID Relief Fraud
A Seattle doctor was taken into custody today on allegations that he fraudulently sought over $3 million in Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans.
Dr. Eric R. Shibley, 41, of Seattle, Washington, was charged by criminal complaint, unsealed today upon his arrest, in the Western District of Washington with one count of wire fraud and one count of bank fraud.  He is expected to make his initial appearance before U.S. Magistrate Judge Michelle L. Peterson at 2 p.m. PDT today.
The complaint alleges that Shibley submitted several fraudulent PPP loan applications to federally insured financial institutions, other U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA)-approved lenders, and the SBA in the names of businesses with no actual operations or by misrepresenting the business’s eligibility.  In the applications, Shibley allegedly misrepresented the number of employees and payroll expenses in several applications and concealed his own criminal history.  To support the fraudulent applications, the complaint alleges that Shibley submitted fake tax documents and the names of purported employees who did not, in fact, work for the businesses for which Shibley claimed they worked.  The complaint alleges that Shibley fraudulently sought over $3 million in PPP loans.
The CARES Act is a federal law enacted March 29.  It is designed to provide emergency financial assistance to millions of Americans who are suffering the economic effects resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.  One source of relief provided by the CARES Act is the authorization of up to $349 billion in forgivable loans to small businesses for job retention and certain other expenses through the PPP.  In April 2020, Congress authorized over $300 billion in additional PPP funding.
The PPP allows qualifying small businesses and other organizations to receive loans with a maturity of two years and an interest rate of one percent.  Businesses must use PPP loan proceeds for payroll costs, interest on mortgages, rent and utilities.  The PPP allows the interest and principal to be forgiven if businesses spend the proceeds on these expenses within a set time period and use at least a certain percentage of the loan towards payroll expenses.

Texas Man Charged with COVID-Relief Fraud, False Statements and Money Laundering
Owner of Wedding Planning Company Fraudulently Sought More Than $3 Million in Small Business Administration Paycheck Protection Program Loans
A Texas man was charged in an indictment unsealed today with wire fraud, false statements to a financial institution and money laundering for his alleged participation in a scheme to file fraudulent loan applications seeking more than $3 million in forgivable Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (SBA) under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.
Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Stephen J. Cox of the Eastern District of Texas, Special Agent in Charge Donald Abram of SBA Office of Inspector General (OIG) Central Region, Inspector General J.

Lerner of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) made the announcement.
Fahad Shah, 44, of Murphy, Texas, was charged in an indictment filed in the Eastern District of Texas with three counts of wire fraud, one count of false statements to a bank, and four counts of money laundering.  Shah was arrested this morning and appeared today before U.S. Magistrate Judge Christine A. Nowak of the Eastern District of Texas.
The indictment alleges that Shah submitted fraudulent applications for over $3 million in PPP loans to two different SBA-approved lenders filed under the name of WBF Weddings by Farah Inc. In these applications, Shah claimed to have over 120 employees earning wages when, in fact, no employees worked for his business at the time, the indictment alleges.  The indictment also alleges that Shah submitted fraudulent documentation in support of his applications.  Shah ultimately received over $1.5 million in PPP loan funds and used the funds primarily for personal purposes, including purchasing a Tesla, personal investments, and home mortgage payments, the indictment alleges.

Bonavolonta of the FBI’s Boston Field Office, Special Agent in Charge Kristina O’Connell of the IRS-Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI), Inspector General Mark Bialek of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Consumer Protection Bureau, Office of Inspector General (FRB-CFPB OIG), and Inspector General Jay N. Lerner of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of Inspector General (FDIC OIG) made the announcement.
Elijah Majak Buoi, 38, of Winchester, Massachusetts, was charged in a criminal complaint filed in the District of Massachusetts with wire fraud, and will appear in federal court in Boston this afternoon.
The complaint alleges that Buoi is the president and CEO of an information technology services company, Sosuda Tech LLC.  Between April 2020 and June 2020, Buoi allegedly submitted fraudulent applications for over $13 million in PPP loans through SBA-approved lenders.  In these applications, Buoi misrepresented the number of employees and payroll expenses and falsely certified that the United States was the primary residence for his employees.  Buoi also allegedly submitted falsified documentation in support of his applications for PPP funds.  The complaint further alleges that Buoi ultimately received over $2 million in PPP funds.  The government has seized approximately $1.98 million from Sosuda’s business bank accounts.
The CARES Act is a federal law enacted on March 29, 2020, designed to provide emergency financial assistance to the millions of Americans who are suffering the economic effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.  One source of relief provided by the CARES Act was the authorization of up to $349 billion in forgivable loans to small businesses for job retention and certain other expenses, through the PPP.  In April 2020, Congress authorized over $300 billion in additional PPP funding.
The PPP allows qualifying small-businesses and other organizations to receive loans with a maturity of two years and an interest rate of 1 percent.  PPP loan proceeds must be used by businesses on payroll costs, interest on mortgages, rent, and utilities.  The PPP allows the interest and principal on the PPP loan to be entirely forgiven if the business spends the loan proceeds on these expense items within a designated period of time after receiving the proceeds and uses at least a certain percentage of the PPP loan proceeds on payroll expenses.
A federal criminal complaint is merely an accusation. A defendant is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.
Trial Attorney Della Sentilles of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Mackenzie Queenin and Carol Head for the District of Massachusetts are prosecuting the case.  The Justice Department acknowledges and thanks the FBI, IRS-CI, FRB-CFOB OIG, and the FDIC OIG for their efforts in investigating this matter.  The Justice Department would also like to thank the SBA OIG for their support and assistance.

Federal Complaint Filed Against Austin Man for Multi-Million Dollar Fraud Scheme Related to the SBA Paycheck Protection Program During COVID-19 Pandemic
In Austin today, federal authorities arrested Michael George McQuarn, 51 of Austin, for allegedly defrauding the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) Paycheck Protection Program of more than $2 million.
U.S. Attorney John F. Bash; SBA Office of Inspector General (SBA OIG) Central Region Special Agent in Charge Donald Abram; Acting IRS-Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI) Special Agent in Charge Rodrick Benton, Houston Field Office; Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration Office of Investigations (TIGTA) Special Agent in Charge Gary L. Smith, Mid-States Field Division; Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC-OIG) Special Agent in Charge Laurie L. Younger, Dallas; and, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton made today’s announcement.
This year, Congress has authorized over $600 billion in emergency financial assistance to millions of Americans suffering economic hardship caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.  A portion of those funds included forgivable loans to small businesses for job retention and certain other expenses (payroll, rent, utilities, mortgage payments, etc.) through the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP).  In order to receive funding, businesses must submit an application along with supporting documentation which must be approved by the SBA.
A criminal complaint unsealed this morning charges McQuarn with wire fraud and making false statements to the SBA.  The complaint alleges that beginning in April 2020, McQuarn implemented a scheme whereby he submitted fraudulent applications and supporting paperwork of two fictitious companies he created—Vantastic Voyages, LLC and Happy Days Movers, LLC—to secure SBA-backed PPP loans.  McQuarn claimed the funds were for legitimate business purposes when, in fact, the money was used for his own personal use, including purchasing a 26’ Pavati Wake Boat and a Rolls Royce.  The complaint further alleges that McQuarn fraudulently received in excess of $2 million in PPP funds.
“The Paycheck Protection Program was designed to help Americans struggling with financial hardship during the pandemic. Our office will be aggressive in targeting anyone who defrauds this critical program,” stated U.S. Attorney Bash.
“The defendant egregiously sought personal gain from a program intended to assist hardworking Americans in this challenging time,” said SBA OIG Central Region Special Agent in Charge Abram.  “SBA OIG and its law enforcement partners will aggressively pursue allegations of wrongdoing to maintain the integrity of SBA’s programs.  I want to thank the U.S. Attorney’s Office and our law enforcement partners for their dedication and pursuit of justice.”
“We are pleased to join our law enforcement partners in pursuit of those individuals using the COVID-19 pandemic as an opportunity to defraud the nation’s financial institutions and government relief programs,” stated FDIC-OIG Special Agent in Charge Younger.
Upon conviction, McQuarn faces terms of imprisonment up to 20 years for wire fraud and up to five years for making false statements to the SBA.
SBA OIG, IRS-CI, FDIC-OIG, TIGTA and the Texas Attorney General’s Office are conducting this ongoing investigation.  Assistant U.S. Attorneys Matthew Devlin, Michael Galdo and Robert Almonte are prosecuting this case on behalf of the government.

New Orleans Hotel Owner Charged With Conspiracy to Defraud First NBC Bank
NEW ORLEANS – The United States Attorney’s Office announced that ARVIND “MIKE” VIRA (“VIRA”), age 74, a resident of New Orleans, Louisiana, was charged today with conspiracy to defraud First NBC Bank, the New Orleans-based bank that failed in April 2017.
According to the Bill of Information, from in or around April 2010 through April 2017, VIRA had a banking relationship with First NBC Bank, individually and through his companies.  During that time, Bank President A acted as VIRA’S de facto loan officer and ensured that VIRA received beneficial interest rates on savings accounts, checking accounts, and loans.  In return, VIRA agreed to make loans to Bank President A.  VIRA agreed to keep these loans to Bank President A concealed from employees of First NBC Bank at the direction of Bank President A.  Bank President A likewise concealed this relationship from others at First NBC Bank and from Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) examiners.
The Bill of Information also alleges that, at the direction of Bank President A, VIRA inflated his own assets on financial statements that he submitted to First NBC Bank in support of his loans.  As a result, VIRA and Bank President A were able to defraud First NBC Bank by using nominee loans to funnel money to Bank President A without bank or regulatory scrutiny.
VIRA is charged in the Bill of Information with one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Sections 371 and 1344.  The maximum penalties that may be imposed upon conviction are five years in prison, a $250,000.00 fine, up to three years of supervised release, and a mandatory $100 special assessment.
The U.S. Attorney’s Office stated that a Bill of Information is merely an accusation and that the guilt of the defendant must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.

Owner of Business Consulting Firm Admits Orchestrating Multimillion-Dollar Bank Fraud and Securities Fraud Scheme,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/owner-business-consulting-firm-admits-orchestrating-multimillion,"June 11, 2020",2020,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Owner of Business Consulting Firm Admits Orchestrating Multimillion-Dollar Bank Fraud and Securities Fraud Scheme
NEWARK, N.J. – A Passaic County, New Jersey, man who founded and owned a business consulting firm admitted today to orchestrating a multimillion-dollar bank fraud and securities fraud scheme operated through that firm, U.S. Attorney Craig Carpenito announced.
Edward Espinal, 44, of Wayne, New Jersey, the chief executive officer of Cash Flow Partners LLC (Cash Flow) pleaded guilty by videoconference before U.S. District Judge Kevin McNulty to an information charging him with one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud and one count of securities fraud.
“Edward Espinal coordinated a vast fraud scheme that lured people into taking out fraudulent loans that his company helped obtain and, in many cases, put that borrowed money into sham investments he also controlled,” U.S. Attorney Carpenito said. “His complex scam tricked numerous investors out of a substantial amount of money, and now he will have to pay for his crimes.”
“This defendant is the quintessential con artist,” Acting FBI Special Agent in Charge Douglas Korneski said. “He played a shell game with other people’s hard-earned money, making promises he never intended to keep, and walking away with ill-gotten gains while leaving them high and dry. Fraudsters like Edward Espinal keep the FBI in business, and we work diligently to bring his type to justice.”
According to documents filed in this case and statements made in court:
The Bank Fraud Conspiracy
Espinal was the founder and chief executive officer of Cash Flow and controlled the company’s operations. From March 2016 through December 2019, Espinal led and directed a bank fraud conspiracy designed to obtain millions of dollars in loans from banks on the basis of false representations. To attract customers, Cash Flow released internet advertisements and held seminars offering to assist customers with low-paying salaries in obtaining loans. These advertisements included promotional videos featuring Espinal and a former telenovela actor. Customers contacted Cash Flow and were routed to the company’s sales department.
Employees in the sales department then encouraged customers to sign up for various loan programs that Cash Flow provided and to enter into contracts with Cash Flow. Under those contracts, employees would help customers obtain loans from banks. The Cash Flow contracts permitted customers to keep a portion of the loan proceeds and customers agreed to provide the remaining percentage of the proceeds to Cash Flow. Cash Flow agreed to pay off the loans on behalf of its customers.
Cash Flow then used false information and fraudulent documents to obtain loans for its customers for which they otherwise would not have qualified, and posed as the customers in communications with the banks.
The Securities Fraud
From July 2016 through September 2019, Espinal obtained more than $5 million in investments from victim investors on the basis of false and fraudulent pretenses and representations.
Espinal solicited investments from prospective customers using a marketing campaign on Spanish language television channels and the internet, the “Cash Flow TV” YouTube page, and live presentations in Cash Flow’s offices and elsewhere. Espinal also solicited investments from individuals who obtained loans through Cash Flow’s bank fraud conspiracy, encouraging loan customers to invest loan proceeds in Cash Flow’s investment program. Once investors agreed to invest in Cash Flow, Espinal issued “promissory notes” to investors that guaranteed monthly investment returns between 1.25 percent and 4 percent. The promissory notes stated that Cash Flow would return investors’ principal either one year from the date of the promissory note, or 60 days after investors demanded payment. Espinal and other Cash Flow employees signed the promissory notes on behalf of Cash Flow.
Espinal made a number of misrepresentations to investors. He told investors that he would pool their funds with the funds of other investors in investments related to real estate, real estate companies, a gold mine in Ecuador, and construction projects in countries outside of the United States. In reality, Espinal used investor funds to pay returns to earlier investors, to pay for personal expenses for himself, his family, and another Cash Flow employee, to perpetuate the bank fraud scheme, and to market the bank fraud and investment scheme to future victims. Espinal falsely claimed that Cash Flow’s purported real estate fund, Cash Flow Capital, was “licensed” by the Securities and Exchange Commission. He guaranteed monthly returns on investment based on the purported proceeds from the sale of properties in Cash Flow’s investment portfolio. In reality, Espinal did not sell Cash Flow properties, so no profits were derived from the sale of Cash Flow properties.
Two other individuals, Raymundo Torres and Jennie Frias, have previously pleaded guilty to their roles in the Cash Flow bank fraud conspiracy and are awaiting sentencing.
The conspiracy to commit bank fraud charge carries a maximum potential penalty of 30 years in prison and a $1 million fine. The securities fraud counts carry a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and a $5 million fine. Sentencing is scheduled for Oct. 13, 2020.
Individuals who believe they may have information about this case may contact the FBI at 1-800-CALL-FBI (225-5324).
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has filed a civil complaint against Espinal based on the allegations underlying the securities fraud charge.
U.S. Attorney Carpenito credited special agents of the FDIC-Office of the Inspector General (FDIC-OIG), under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Patricia Tarasca in New York, and special agents of the FBI, under the direction of Acting Special Agent in Charge Douglas Korneski in Newark, with the investigation leading to today’s guilty plea. He also thanked the SEC for the assistance provided by its Enforcement Division.
The government is represented by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Ari B. Fontecchio and J. Stephen Ferketic of the U.S. Attorney’s Criminal Division in Newark.

Delta County Bank President Guilty of Bank Fraud and Arson Violations
SHERMAN, Texas – A 57-year-old former bank president has pleaded guilty to federal violations in the Eastern District of Texas, announced U.S. Attorney Stephen J. Cox today.
Anita Gail Moody, of Cooper, Texas, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit bank fraud and arson today before U.S. Magistrate Judge Christine A. Nowak.
According to information presented in court, Moody was President of Enloe State Bank in Cooper, Texas.  On May 11, 2019, the bank had a fire that was determined to be arson.  The fire was contained to the bank’s boardroom, but the entire bank suffered smoke damage.  Several files had been stacked on the boardroom table, all of which were burned in the fire. Coincidentally, the bank was scheduled for a review by the Texas Department of Banking the next day.  Further investigation into the fire and the bank revealed that Moody had been creating false nominee loans in the names of several people, including some actual bank customers.  Moody eventually admitted to setting the fire in the boardroom to cover up the criminal activity concerning the false loans.  She also admitted to using the fraudulently obtained money to fund her boyfriend’s business, other businesses of friends, and her own lifestyle.  The fraudulent activity, which began in 2012, resulted in a loss to the bank of approximately $11 million.
Moody has agreed to a sentence of 84 months in federal prison and will pay restitution in the amount of $11,136,241.82  A sentencing hearing will be scheduled after the completion of a presentence investigation by the U.S. Probation Office.
This case was investigated by the FDIC-OIG and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives and prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Maureen Smith and Wes Wynne.

Rochester Man Indicted on Fraud Charges for Allegedly Operating a Medical Equipment Reseller Business that Defrauded Victims of More Than $250,000
SPRINGFIELD, Ill. – A federal grand jury has indicted a Rochester, Ill., man, Chase Brown, 20, of the 1000 block of Heathrow Lane, Rochester, Ill., on fraud charges for allegedly operating a medical equipment reseller business that defrauded businesses from various states of more than $250,000. Brown was previously arrested and charged in a criminal complaint filed in March 2020. Brown was arrested on March 10, 2020, in the Middle District of Florida and made his initial appearance in federal court in Tampa, Fla. Brown has been transferred to the Central District of Illinois and has been ordered to remain detained in the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service.
The indictment alleges Brown established a business known as Midwest Surgical, LLC, in May 2019, purportedly to engage in the purchase and resale of medical equipment. As part of the scheme, in December 2018, seven months after forming the business, Brown applied for an aviation credit card. In the application, the indictment alleges that Brown falsely stated that Midwest’s annual revenue was more than $18 million and that it employed 26 employees. After obtaining the credit card, Brown incurred more than $200,000 in charges for fuel, private charter flights and plane maintenance, including approximately $4,500 from an aviation company in Springfield, Ill.
Brown allegedly made repeated false and fraudulent promises and representations to various persons and businesses throughout the country that he would buy or sell medical equipment that he had no intention or ability to sell or purchase. After falsely representing that he would sell medical equipment, Brown used the buyers’ credit card information for personal purchases for himself and one or more of his friends but never provided the equipment to the buyer, Similarly, after falsely representing to a seller that he would purchase medical equipment, Brown provided false or fraudulent payment information, knowing that he had no intention or ability to legitimately fund the purchases.
As alleged in the indictment, Brown contacted and defrauded victim businesses in Pennsylvania, Illinois, Texas and Idaho, including in October 2019, when Brown entered into a consignment agreement with an Illinois hospital to liquidate its equipment. As part of the agreement, Brown was required to make two payments of $375,000 to the hospital. Although Brown received the equipment, the $375,000 check he provided bounced and he falsely represented that he submitted a separate $375,000 wire transfer that never occurred. Brown ultimately returned most of the equipment to the hospital but retained approximately $10,000 worth of equipment for which he made no payment.
The indictment alleges Brown used another victim’s credit card information to purchase a used Jeep Wrangler, a set of tires for the vehicle, to pay a bill at a Springfield sports bar, payment to a law firm, and the purchase of a second vehicle for a friend.
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) Office of Inspector General and the Springfield Police Department conducted the investigation. Assistant U.S. Attorney Timothy A. Bass represents the government in the prosecution.
If convicted, the statutory penalty for each count of wire fraud (two counts) is up to 30 years in prison; for access device fraud, the penalty is up to 10 years in prison.
Members of the public are reminded that an indictment is merely an accusation; the defendant is presumed innocent unless proven guilty.

Arkansas Project Manager Charged in Oklahoma with COVID-Relief Fraud
Information Technology Professional Fraudulently Sought More than $8 Million in CARES Act SBA Paycheck Protection Program Loans
A project manager employed by a major retailer was charged in a complaint unsealed Wednesday for allegedly filing fraudulent bank loan applications seeking more than $8 million in forgivable loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (SBA) under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.
Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Trent Shores for the Northern District of Oklahoma, Acting Deputy Inspector General Richard Parker of the Federal Housing Finance Agency Office of Inspector General (FHFA OIG), Inspector General Jay N. Lerner of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC OIG) and Inspector General Hannibal “Mike” Ware of the Small Business Administration Office of Inspector General (SBA OIG) made the announcement.
Benjamin Hayford, 32, of Centerton, Arkansas, was charged in a federal criminal complaint filed in the Northern District of Oklahoma with wire fraud, bank fraud, making false statements to a financial institution, and making false statements to the SBA.
Hayford allegedly sought millions of dollars in forgivable loans guaranteed by the SBA from multiple banks by claiming fictitious payroll expenses.  To support his applications, Hayford allegedly provided lenders with fraudulent payroll documentation purporting to establish payroll expenses that were, in fact, non-existent.  In addition, Hayford represented to a financial institution that the Limited Liability Partnership for which he applied for relief was established in January 2020 and was operating as of Feb. 15, 2020.  In fact, a search of the contents of Hayford’s email account revealed that Hayford did not create the partnership until April 2020, several days before he began applying for Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans.
The CARES Act is a federal law enacted on March 29, 2020, designed to provide emergency financial assistance to the millions of Americans who are suffering the economic effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.  One source of relief provided by the CARES Act was the authorization of up to $349 billion in forgivable loans to small businesses for job retention and certain other expenses, through the PPP.  In April 2020, Congress authorized over $300 billion in additional PPP funding.
The PPP allows qualifying small businesses and other organizations to receive loans with a maturity of two years and an interest rate of 1 percent.  PPP loan proceeds must be used by businesses on payroll costs, interest on mortgages, rent, and utilities.  The PPP allows the interest and principal to be forgiven if businesses spend the proceeds on these expenses within eight weeks of receipt and use at least 75 percent of the forgiven amount for payroll.
A federal criminal complaint is merely an accusation. A defendant is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.
Deputy Chief Brian R. Young of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Victor A.S. Régal for the Northern District of Oklahoma are prosecuting the case.  The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Arkansas provided valuable assistance in this matter.

Former President of First Mortgage Company Charged with 24 Counts of Financial Fraud
OKLAHOMA CITY – Yesterday, a federal grand jury returned a 24-Count Indictment charging Ronald J. McCord, 69, of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, with defrauding two locally-based banks, Fannie Mae, and others, announced Timothy J. Downing, United States Attorney for the Western District of Oklahoma.  The charges include bank fraud, money laundering, and making a false statement to a financial institution.
McCord was the former President of First Mortgage Company, LLC (""FMC""), an Oklahoma City-based mortgage lending and loan servicing company.  The Indictment alleges a broad range of fraudulent conduct spanning approximately three years.
McCord is charged in Counts 1 through 7 with defrauding Spirit Bank (""Spirit"") and Citizens State Bank (""Citizens"")—two state-chartered financial institutions—as well as their respective residential mortgage subsidiaries, American Southwest Mortgage Corporation (""Mortgage Corp."") and American Southwest Mortgage Funding Corporation (""Funding Corp."").  According to the Indictment, in approximately June 2016, an independent audit discovered that McCord had sold more than $14,100,000.00 in Spirit/Mortgage Corp. and Citizens/Funding Corp. loans ""out of trust"" by failing to repay Spirit/Mortgage Corp. when certain Spirit/Mortgage Corp.-initiated loans were refinanced or otherwise paid off.  At the time of this discovery, FMC carried outstanding balances of about $200,000,000.00 and $140,000,000.00 on the Spirit/Mortgage Corp. and Citizens/Funding Corp. lines of credit, respectively.
According to the Indictment, this discovery prompted further internal review.  An internal audit revealed that McCord had misappropriated additional Spirit/Mortgage Corp. and Citizens/Funding Corp. loans by: (1) using FMC’s warehouse line of credit with (i.e., obtaining mortgage loans from) Spirit/Mortgage Corp. or Citizens/Funding Corp., selling those Spirit/Mortgage Corp. or Citizens/Funding Corp. loans to Fannie Mae, then resubmitting the loan documents to Spirit/Mortgage Corp. or Citizens/Funding Corp. to receive additional money from the Spirit/Mortgage Corp. or Citizens/Funding Corp. line of credit; (2) using FMC’s warehouse line of credit with Spirit/Mortgage Corp. or Citizens/Funding Corp. to refinance the resulting loans without repaying Spirit/Mortgage Corp. or Citizens/Funding Corp. the originally loaned funds; (3) using FMC’s Spirit/Mortgage Corp. or Citizens/Funding Corp. line of credit to fund mortgages to borrowers, receiving payments from those borrowers, but never repaying Spirit/Mortgage Corp. or Citizens/Funding Corp.; (4) obtaining funds from Spirit/Mortgage Corp. or Citizens/Funding Corp. for loans that never closed, then failing to return the funds to Spirit/Mortgage Corp. or Citizens/Funding Corp.; and (5) using FMC’s warehouse lines of credit with Spirit/Mortgage Corp. and Citizens/Funding Corp. to ""double fund"" loans by obtaining funds from both financial institutions to fund the same loans.  The Indictment alleges that McCord’s actions involved Spirit/Mortgage Corp. and Citizens/Funding Corp. loans that totaled approximately $40,000,000.00, in addition to the more than $14,100,000.00 in Spirit/Mortgage and Citizens/Funding Corp. loans that McCord had sold out of trust.
The Indictment further alleges that, upon learning of McCord’s conduct, Spirit/Mortgage Corp. and Citizens/Funding Corp. terminated future warehouse lending to FMC, and instituted new notification requirements that required McCord to assign FMC-funded mortgages to Spirit/Mortgage Corp. and Citizens/Funding Corp., to ensure that the title companies handling those mortgages sent payoffs directly to the banks.  Though McCord filed the assignments as required, his employees contacted the title companies handling the mortgages and directed payments to FMC, not Spirit/Mortgage Corp. and Citizens/Funding Corp.  McCord continued to collect loan payoffs without repaying Spirit/Mortgage Corp. and Citizens/Funding Corp.  He then signed releases on the assigned mortgages after receiving the payoffs, subjecting the properties to potential foreclosure should Spirit/Mortgage Corp. or Citizens/Funding Corp. try to collect payments on the mortgages, to which they held title.
According to Count 8 of the Indictment, Spirit/Mortgage Corp. and Citizens/Funding Corp.’s refusal to fund new FMC mortgages prompted McCord to seek out a new warehouse lender.  In early 2017, McCord began negotiating with CapLOC, LLC, a North Carolina-based mortgage lending business, and offered to sell FMC’s mortgage lending business in exchange for quick funding from CapLOC.  In the course of those negotiations, McCord made false statements and representations to obtain CapLOC funds.  McCord then used the money to repay Spirit/Mortgage Corp. part of his outstanding $40,000,000.00 debt.
Finally, the Indictment alleges that, in 2017, FMC serviced approximately 12,000 loans worth a total of approximately $1,800,000,000.00 for the Federal National Mortgage Association (""Fannie Mae"").  Counts 9 through 24 of the Indictment allege that McCord defrauded Fannie Mae by diverting escrow monies intended to pay homeowners’ taxes, insurance, principal, and interest, to cover FMC’s operating expenses.  As a result, McCord bounced checks to more than sixty taxing authorities, and borrowers throughout the Oklahoma City area and elsewhere missed making their tax payments.  The Indictment further alleges that McCord laundered the stolen escrow monies by using the funds to write himself checks, pay more than half the purchase price of his son’s $900,000.00 Oklahoma City home, and build a custom vacation home in Colorado.
With regard to the bank fraud and false statement to a financial institution charges in the Indictment, McCord faces up to 30 years in prison and a fine of up to $1,000,000.00 on each count.  He also faces up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 .00 fine on to each of the money laundering counts. Furthermore, the Indictment seeks forfeiture from McCord in the amount of the proceeds of the fraudulent schemes and in the amount of the property involved in the offenses.
This case is the result of an investigation by the Federal Housing Finance Agency Office of the Inspector General, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation Oklahoma City Field Office.  It is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Julia E. Barry.

Hollywood Film Producer Charged with $1.7 Million COVID-Relief Fraud,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/hollywood-film-producer-charged-17-million-covid-relief-fraud,"May 22, 2020",2020,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Hollywood Film Producer Charged with $1.7 Million COVID-Relief Fraud
Individual Used Funds for Personal Expenses
A California man has been charged with allegedly filing bank loan applications fraudulently seeking more than $1.7 million dollars in forgivable Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (SBA) under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.
William Sadleir, 66, of Beverly Hills, California, was charged in a federal criminal complaint filed in the Central District of California with wire fraud, bank fraud, false statements to a financial institution, and false statements to the SBA.
“This defendant allegedly used Paycheck Protection Program loans to pay off his personal credit card debts and other personal expenses, rather than using the funds for legitimate business needs,” said Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division.  “As the department has made clear, those who defraud the PPP to line their own pockets at the expense of the American people will be brought to justice.”
“This film producer allegedly made a series of misrepresentations to a bank and the Small Business Administration to illegally secure taxpayer money that he then used to fund his nearly empty personal bank account,” said U.S. Attorney Nick Hanna of the Central District of California. “The Paycheck Protection Program was implemented to help small businesses stay afloat during the financial crisis, and we will act swiftly against those who abuse the program for their own personal gain.”
“These funds were designed to be a lifeline to businesses struggling to stay afloat during the current crisis,” said Assistant Director in Charge Paul Delacourt of the FBI’s Los Angeles Field Office.  “The FBI is committed to maintaining the integrity of the PPP and will hold accountable those who cheat the system at the expense of American taxpayers.”
“SBA OIG applauds due diligence by SBA’s lending partners to maintain the integrity of the lending programs,” said Special Agent in Charge Weston King of the SBA Office of Inspector General (SBA OIG) Western Region.  “Providing false statements to gain access to SBA’s programs will be aggressively investigated by our office in partnership with our law enforcement counterparts.  I want to thank the U.S. Attorney’s Office and our law enforcement partners for their dedication and pursuit of justice.”
“Today’s charges hold the defendant responsible for his alleged actions to swindle money out of a federal program intended to help those in need during a pandemic crisis,” said Special Agent in Charge Wade V. Walters of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC OIG).  “When an individual cheats the Paycheck Protection Program out of money, it deprives hard-working Americans and deserving small businesses.  The FDIC OIG is committed to working with our law enforcement partners to investigate financial crimes in order to preserve the integrity of the nation’s banking sector.”
According to court documents unsealed today in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, Sadleir allegedly obtained over $1.7 million in forgivable loans guaranteed by the SBA by falsely representing that the funds would be used to support payroll expenses for three film production and distribution companies, when, in fact, Sadleir intended to use and did use a significant portion of the funds for personal and non-business-related expenses, including personal credit cards and a car loan.  Sadleir allegedly used three entities he controlled to obtain over $1.7 million in PPP loans guaranteed by the SBA for COVID-19 relief.
The applications submitted to the lenders certified that the funds would be used for payroll expenses and other specific business-related expenses, such as utilities or rent payments.  According to the complaint, these certifications were false.  As soon as Sadleir obtained the funds, he allegedly transferred over half the money to a personal bank account and began using and attempting to use the funds to pay off personal credit card debts totaling more than $80,000 and a car loan totaling approximately $40,000, among other personal expenses.
The CARES Act is a federal law enacted on March 29, 2020, designed to provide emergency financial assistance to the millions of Americans who are suffering the economic effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.  One source of relief provided by the CARES Act was the authorization of up to $349 billion in forgivable loans to small businesses for job retention and certain other expenses, through the PPP.  In April 2020, Congress authorized over $300 billion in additional PPP funding.
The PPP allows qualifying small-businesses and other organizations to receive loans with a maturity of two years and an interest rate of 1 percent.  PPP loan proceeds must be used by businesses on payroll costs, interest on mortgages, rent, and utilities.  The PPP allows the interest and principal to be forgiven if businesses spend the proceeds on these expenses within eight weeks of receipt and use at least 75 percent of the forgiven amount for payroll.
A federal criminal complaint is merely an accusation. A defendant is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.
Trial Attorney Amanda R. Vaughn of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Alex Wyman for the Central District of California are prosecuting the case.
The Justice Department acknowledges and thanks the FBI, the SBA OIG, and the FDIC OIG for their efforts investigating this mater.

Engineer Charged in Texas with COVID-Relief Fraud
Texas Engineer Fraudulently Sought More than $10 Million in CARES Act SBA Paycheck Protection Loans
An engineer has been charged in the Eastern District of Texas with allegedly filing bank loan applications fraudulently seeking more than $10 million dollars in forgivable loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (SBA) under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.
Shashank Rai, 30, of Beaumont, Texas, allegedly sought millions of dollars in forgivable loans guaranteed by the SBA from two different banks by claiming to have 250 employees earning wages when, in fact, no employees worked for his purported business.
Rai is charged by way of a federal criminal complaint with violations of wire fraud, bank fraud, false statements to a financial institution, and false statements to the SBA.
“As alleged, Rai fraudulently pursued millions of dollars in loans intended for legitimate small businesses suffering the economic hardships of the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division.  “The department and our law enforcement partners will remain vigilant in our efforts to protect critical CARES Act relief programs from fraud and abuse.”
“The behavior in this case was very brazen,” said U.S. Attorney Joseph D. Brown of the Eastern District of Texas.  “Those who submit these applications for loans or other assistance need to understand that there are people checking on the representations made, and those representations are made under oath and subject to the penalties of perjury. Federal agencies are watching for fraud, and people who lie and try to cheat the system are going to be caught and prosecuted.”
“To support small and community banks, the Federal Home Loan Banks can accept Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans as collateral when making loans to their members,” said Richard Parker, Acting Deputy Inspector General for Investigations for the Federal Housing Finance Agency, Office of Inspector General.  “The Office of Inspector General is proud to work with our partners in law enforcement to prevent, detect, and deter attempts to perpetrate fraud in the Federal Home Loan Bank System and steal the assistance intended for small business owners and employees under this important part of the CARES Act.”
“Today’s charges hold the defendant responsible for his actions to swindle money out of a federal program intended to help those in need during a pandemic crisis,” said Inspector General Jay N. Lerner of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC OIG).  “When an individual cheats the Paycheck Protection Program out of money, it deprives hard-working Americans and deserving small businesses.  The FDIC OIG is committed to working with our law enforcement partners to investigate financial crimes in order to preserve the integrity of the nation’s banking sector.”
“SBA OIG and its law enforcement partners will aggressively investigate fraud in the Paycheck Protection Program,” said SBA Inspector General Hannibal “Mike” Ware.  “The nation’s small businesses are counting on this program, and we will safeguard it to maintain the public trust.  I want to thank the U.S. Attorney’s Office and our law enforcement partners for their dedication and pursuit of justice.”
“While the government is trying to help out small businesses, scammers are out there trying to help themselves,” said Inspector in Charge Delany De Leon-Colon of the Criminal Investigations Group. “Postal Inspectors are proud to work alongside the Department of Justice and our other law enforcement partners to identify and investigate anyone who capitalizes on this pandemic to commit fraud. The U.S. Postal Inspection Service is committed to protecting small business owners, and the American public, from those who seek to do financial harm.”
According to court documents unsealed today in U.S. District Court in Beaumont, Rai allegedly made two fraudulent claims to two different lenders for seek loans guaranteed by the SBA for COVID-19 relief through the PPP.  In the application submitted to the first lender, Rai allegedly sought $10 million in PPP loan proceeds by fraudulently claiming to have 250 employees with an average monthly payroll of $4 million.  In the second application, Rai allegedly sought approximately $3 million in PPP loan proceeds by fraudulently claiming to have 250 employees with an average monthly payroll of approximately $1.2 million.
According to court documents, the Texas Workforce Commission provided information to investigators of having no records of employee wages having been paid in 2020 by Rai or his purported business, Rai Family LLC. In addition, the Texas Comptroller’s Office of Public Accounts reported to investigators that Rai Family LLC reported no revenues for the fourth quarter of 2019 or the first quarter of 2020.
According to court documents, materials recovered from the trash outside of Rai’s residence included handwritten notes that appear to reflect an investment strategy for the $3 million, which is the amount of money that Rai allegedly sought from the second lender.
The CARES Act is a federal law enacted on March 29, 2020, designed to provide emergency financial assistance to the millions of Americans who are suffering the economic effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.  One source of relief provided by the CARES Act was the authorization of up to $349 billion in forgivable loans to small businesses for job retention and certain other expenses, through the PPP.  In April 2020, Congress authorized over $300 billion in additional PPP funding.

Two Charged with Stimulus Fraud,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/two-charged-stimulus-fraud,"May 5, 2020",2020,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Two Charged with Stimulus Fraud
First in the nation to be charged with fraudulently seeking CARES Act SBA Paycheck Protection Loans
PROVIDENCE – Two businessmen have been charged in the District of Rhode Island with allegedly filing bank loan applications fraudulently seeking more than a half-million dollars in forgivable loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (SBA) under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.
David A. Staveley, aka Kurt D. Sanborn, 52, of Andover, Massachusetts, and David Butziger, 51, of Warwick, Rhode Island, ar charged with conspiring to seek forgivable loans guaranteed by the SBA, claiming to have dozens of employees earning wages at four different business entities when, in fact, there were no employees working for any of the businesses.
Staveley and Butziger are charged by way of a federal criminal complaint with conspiracy to make false statements to influence the SBA and conspiracy to commit bank fraud. Additionally, Staveley is charged with aggravated identity theft. Butziger is charged with bank fraud.
“Tens of millions of Americans have lost their jobs and have had their lives thrown into chaos because of the coronavirus pandemic. It is unconscionable that anyone would attempt to steal from a program intended to help hard working Americans continue to be paid so they can feed their families and pay some of their bills,” said U.S. Attorney Aaron L. Weisman for the District of Rhode Island. “Attorney General Barr has directed all U.S. Attorneys to prioritize the investigation and prosecution of crimes related to coronavirus and COVID-19, and we are doing just that.”
“Every dollar stolen from the Paycheck Protection Program comes at the expense of employees and small business owners who are working hard to make it through these difficult times,” said Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division.  “The Criminal Division is committed to working with our law enforcement partners to root out abuse of the important relief programs established under the CARES Act.”
“As alleged, David Staveley and David Butziger tried to capitalize on the coronavirus crisis by conspiring to fraudulently obtain more than half a million dollars in forgivable loans that were intended to help small businesses teetering on the edge of financial ruin,” said Special Agent in Charge Joseph R. Bonavolonta of the FBI’s Boston Field Office. “Thankfully we were able to stop them before taxpayers were defrauded, but today’s arrests should serve as a warning to others that the FBI and our law enforcement partners will aggressively go after bad actors like them who are utilizing the COVID-19 pandemic as an opportunity to commit fraud.”
“The alleged actions of defendants Staveley and Butziger are criminally reprehensible,” said Special Agent in Charge Kristina O’Connell of the IRS-Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI). “Defrauding a government program designed to provide financial assistance to small business owners during the Coronavirus pandemic is tantamount to taking money directly out of the pockets of those who need it most.  Today’s arrests exemplify the hard work, dedication and efficiency of IRS-CI and the entire investigative team.”
“This is a critical time for our nation’s small businesses.  It is well known that fraudsters prey upon those in vulnerable positions,” said SBA Inspector General Hannibal “Mike” Ware.  “As this result shows, SBA-OIG and its law enforcement partners are actively working together to root out fraud in SBA’s programs and bring those responsible to justice.  I want to thank the U.S. Attorney’s Office and our law enforcement partners for their leadership and dedication throughout this investigation.”
According to court documents unsealed today in U.S. District Court in Providence, Rhode Island, the fraudulent loan requests were to pay employees of businesses that were not operating prior to the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and had no salaried employees, or, as in one instance, to pay employees at a business the loan applicant did not own.
Allegedly, Staveley and Butziger discussed via email the creation of fraudulent loan applications and supporting documentations to seek loans guaranteed by the SBA for COVID-19 relief through the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). It is alleged that Staveley posed as his brother in real estate transactions.
It is alleged that Staveley claimed in loan applications requesting more than $438,500 that he had dozens of employees at three restaurants he owned, two in Warwick, Rhode Island, and one in Berlin, Massachusetts. An investigation determined that one of the Rhode Island restaurants, the former Remington House, and the Massachusetts restaurant, On The Trax, were not open for business prior to the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, at the time the loan applications were submitted, or at any time thereafter. Moreover, Staveley did not own or have any role in the second Rhode Island restaurant, Top of the Bay, for which he was seeking financial relief.
According to court documents, Staveley’s Massachusetts restaurant was closed by March 10, 2020, when the town of Berlin revoked the business’ liquor license for numerous reasons, including that “Sanborn” allegedly misrepresented that his brother owned the restaurant. Investigators obtained information that Staveley/Sanborn allegedly used his brother’s personal identifying information in other real estate transactions as well.
According to court documents, it is alleged that on April 6, 2020, Butziger filed an application seeking a $105,381 SBA loan under the PPP as owner of an unincorporated entity named Dock Wireless.  Butziger claimed in documentation filed with the bank and in a telephone call with an FBI undercover agent posing as a bank compliance officer that he had seven full-time employees on Dock Wireless’ payroll, including himself. Butziger falsely represented to the agent that he brought the employees on full-time on Jan. 1, 2020, and laid them off at the end of March. Butziger claimed the employees continued to work without being paid through April 2020, and that he would use SBA PPP funds to pay them.
The Rhode Island State Department of Revenue provided information to the IRS of having no records of employee wages having been paid in 2020 by Butziger or Dock Wireless. Agents interviewed several of the supposed Dock Wireless employees who reported that they never worked for Butziger or Dock Wireless.
The CARES Act is a federal law enacted on March 29, 2020, designed to provide emergency financial assistance to the millions of Americans who are suffering the economic effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.  One source of relief provided by the CARES Act was the authorization of up to $349 billion in forgivable loans to small businesses for job retention and certain other expenses, through the PPP.  In April 2020, Congress authorized over $300 billion in additional PPP funding.
The PPP allows qualifying small-businesses and other organizations to receive loans with a maturity of two years and an interest rate of 1 percent.  PPP loan proceeds must be used by businesses on payroll costs, interest on mortgages, rent, and utilities.  The PPP allows the interest and principal to be forgiven if businesses spend the proceeds on these expenses within eight weeks of receipt and use at least 75 percent of the forgiven amount for payroll.
Staveley and Butziger are the first individuals in the nation charged with allegedly defrauding the CARES Act SBA Paycheck Protection Program.
A federal criminal complaint is merely an accusation. A defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.
Assistant Chief Lawrence Atkinson of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Lee H. Vilker for the District of Rhode Island are prosecuting the case.
The Justice Department acknowledges and thanks the FBI, IRS-CI, SBA Office of Inspector General, and the FDIC, Office of Inspector General for their efforts investigating this mater.

Second Employee in Cash Flow Partners’ Bank Fraud Conspiracy Admits Role in Multimillion-Dollar Loan Scheme
NEWARK, N.J. – A Bergen County, New Jersey, woman today admitted participating in a scheme that involved the creation of false documentation to secure over $4 million in bank loans, U.S. Attorney Craig Carpenito announced.
Jennie Frias, a/k/a “Jennie Castillo,” 36, of Englewood, New Jersey, pleaded guilty by teleconference before U.S. District Judge Kevin McNulty to an information charging her with one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud.
According to documents filed in this case and statements made in court:
Between March 2016 and May 2018, Cash Flow Partners LLC, a business consulting firm with offices in New York and New Jersey, released internet advertisements and held seminars offering to assist customers in obtaining bank loans, including loans insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). When customers submitted documentation supporting their bank loan applications to Cash Flow Partners, Frias and others created false documentation to make customers’ loan applications appear more financially viable than they actually were. Victim banks sustained losses of over $4 million.
One of Frias’ conspirators, Raymundo Torres, previously pleaded guilty to charges relating to his role in the Cash Flow bank fraud conspiracy.
The conspiracy to commit bank fraud charge carries a maximum potential penalty of 30 years in prison and a $1 million fine. Sentencing is scheduled for Sept. 2, 2020.
Individuals who believe they may have information about this case may contact the FBI at 1-800-CALL-FBI (225-5324).
U.S. Attorney Carpenito credited special agents of the FDIC-Office of the Inspector General (FDIC-OIG), under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Patricia Tarasca in New York, and special agents of the FBI, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Gregory W. Ehrie in Newark, with the investigation leading to today’s guilty plea.

Huntington Woman Indicted as Part of International Nigerian Fraud Scheme for Laundering Funds,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/huntington-woman-indicted-part-international-nigerian-fraud,"February 26, 2020",2020,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Huntington Woman Indicted as Part of International Nigerian Fraud Scheme for Laundering Funds
CHARLESTON, W.Va. -- United States Attorney Mike Stuart announced that a federal grand jury has indicted a Huntington woman in connection with laundering funds from an international fraud scheme that scammed money from individuals, many of whom were elderly, in several states and foreign countries.
A twelve count indictment was returned against Patricia Dudding, 68, of Huntington, charging her with conspiracy to commit money laundering, bank fraud and unlawful money transactions.  The indictment alleges that Dudding acted as a money mule for a Nigerian scammer.  According to the indictment, Dudding met “Lucas” online in the early spring of 2018, and although they never actually met in person, Dudding and Lucas communicated frequently by email and text messages.   The indictment alleges that Dudding set up numerous bank accounts in her name at over 10 different banks and that she would use these bank accounts to wire and receive fraudulent funds.  Dudding received numerous deposits in those bank accounts from more than two dozen individuals located in the United States and abroad.  She, and unnamed co-conspirators, would then transfer these funds to bank accounts located in Nigeria. To further the scheme, Dudding admittedly would make false and fraudulent representations to the financial institutions to make it appear that the wire transfers were being sent for legitimate purposes.
“Egregious. This is the largest elder fraud scheme ever prosecuted in the history of West Virginia and our work continues.  This case is significant on a national and international level,” said United States Attorney Mike Stuart. “Elder fraud is an important priority for Attorney General Barr and me.  Elder fraud is a diabolical crime that preys on the vulnerabilities of some of the most vulnerable among us. By all outward appearances, Mrs. Dudding was just an ordinary neighbor but, instead, the indictment alleges she was what we call a “money mule” actively engaged in facilitating a money laundering scheme that left many, many victims in its wake. The stories of the victims are tragic. Our goal is to hold those responsible accountable and to do our best to make victims of these despicable crimes whole. This investigation is on-going.”
“The exploitation of both a vulnerable population as well as our financial systems is a particular evil,” said U.S. Secret Service Charleston Resident Agent in Charge Wade Fleming. “These criminals may not hide behind false identities and fraudulent accounts, and our skilled investigators will continue to pursue and bring these malicious actors before our justice system.”
Money mules play critical roles in the commission and facilitation of fraudulent schemes including elder fraud.  A money mule is someone who transfers illegally acquired money on behalf of or at the direction of another party. Criminal enterprises recruit what is referred to as a “mule” to move money electronically through bank accounts, move physical currency, or assist in the movement of money through a variety of other methods. Money mules are inherently dangerous, as they add layers to the money trail from a victim to a criminal and launder money illegally to aid a criminal actor.
The indictment alleges that Dudding used over $100,000 of victim funds for her personal benefit over the course of the scheme.  Dudding used those funds to pay her utility bills, satellite television service, groceries, drug store purchases, gasoline purchases, department store purchases, restaurants and took numerous cash withdrawals.  Her total cash withdrawals amounted to nearly $42,000.  The total loss contributed to the fraudulent scheme is $3.2 million.  Over $3 million was transferred or deposited into Dudding’s accounts during the scheme and she attempted to transfer over $1.6 million to Nigeria during this period.
During the course of the investigation, warrants were issued for the seizure of nearly $1.9 million related to the alleged scheme.  The indictment seeks forfeiture of those funds.
The victims in this case that have been identified are from six (6) countries including the United States, Australia, Canada, Nevis, Poland, and Sweden as well as twenty (20) states including Alaska, Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, New Jersey, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Texas, and Washington.
The investigation was conducted by the United States Secret Service, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) – Office of Inspector General and the South Charleston Police Department.   Assistant United States Attorney Kathleen Robeson is handling the matter.
“Elder fraud and financial fraud are complex frauds.   I want to commend the excellent, detailed work of the Secret Service, the FDIC-OIG and the South Charleston Police Department, and my team, including AUSA Robeson and my remarkable investigators, Steve Rowley and Tony Hussion.  This was a team effort and I’m proud of their work,” continued Stuart.
If convicted on all counts, Dudding faces up to 20 years in prison.  The investigation is ongoing and could result in additional federal and state charges in the future.
Since President Trump signed the bipartisan Elder Abuse Prevention and Prosecution Act (EAPPA) into law, the Department of Justice has participated in hundreds of enforcement actions in criminal and civil cases that targeted or disproportionately affected seniors.  In particular, in March 2019, the department announced the largest elder fraud enforcement action in American history, charging more than 260 defendants in a nationwide elder fraud sweep .  The department has likewise conducted hundreds of trainings and outreach sessions across the country since the passage of the Act.
More information about the department’s efforts to help American seniors is available at its Elder Justice Initiative webpage .  Elder fraud complaints may be filed with the FTC at www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov or at 877-FTC-HELP.  The Department of Justice provides a variety of resources relating to elder fraud victimization through its Office for Victims of Crime, which can be reached at https://www.ovc.gov .
Please Note:  An indictment is merely an allegation and the defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.

Wells Fargo Agrees to Pay $3 Billion to Resolve Criminal and Civil Investigations into Sales Practices Involving the Opening of Millions of Accounts without Customer Authorization,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/wells-fargo-agrees-pay-3-billion-resolve-criminal-and-civil,"February 21, 2020",2020,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Wells Fargo Agrees to Pay $3 Billion to Resolve Criminal and Civil Investigations into Sales Practices Involving the Opening of Millions of Accounts without Customer Authorization
$3 Billion Payment Result of Deferred Prosecution Agreement in Criminal Matter, Settlement of Civil Claims under FIRREA and Resolution of SEC Proceedings
Wells Fargo & Company and its subsidiary, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., have agreed to pay $3 billion to resolve their potential criminal and civil liability stemming from a practice between 2002 and 2016 of pressuring employees to meet unrealistic sales goals that led thousands of employees to provide millions of accounts or products to customers under false pretenses or without consent, often by creating false records or misusing customers’ identities, the Department of Justice announced today.
As part of the agreements with the United States Attorney’s Offices for the Central District of California and the Western District of North Carolina, the Commercial Litigation Branch of the Civil Division, and the Securities and Exchange Commission, Wells Fargo admitted that it collected millions of dollars in fees and interest to which the Company was not entitled, harmed the credit ratings of certain customers, and unlawfully misused customers’ sensitive personal information, including customers’ means of identification.
“When companies cheat to compete, they harm customers and other competitors,” said Deputy Assistant Attorney General Michael D. Granston of the Department of Justice’s Civil Division.  “This settlement holds Wells Fargo accountable for tolerating fraudulent conduct that is remarkable both for its duration and scope, and for its blatant disregard of customer’s private information.  The Civil Division will continue to use all available tools to protect the American public from fraud and abuse, including misconduct by or against their financial institutions.”
“Our settlement with Wells Fargo, and the $3 billion monetary penalty imposed on the bank, go far beyond ‘the cost of doing business.’  They are appropriate given the staggering size, scope and duration of Wells Fargo’s illicit conduct, which spanned well over a decade,” said U.S. Attorney Andrew Murray for the Western District of North Carolina. “When a reputable institution like Wells Fargo caves to the pernicious forces of greed, and puts its own interests ahead of those of the customers it claims to serve, my office will not sit idle.  Today’s announcement should serve as a stark reminder that no institution is too big, too powerful, or too well-known to be held accountable and face enforcement action for its wrongdoings.”
“This case illustrates a complete failure of leadership at multiple levels within the Bank. Simply put, Wells Fargo traded its hard-earned reputation for short-term profits, and harmed untold numbers of customers along the way,” said U.S. Attorney Nick Hanna for the Central District of California.  “We are hopeful that this $3 billion penalty, along with the personnel and structural changes at the Bank, will ensure that such conduct will not reoccur.”
“Our office is committed to bringing to justice those who deliberately falsify and fabricate bank records in order to deceive regulators and the public,” said Inspector General Mark Bialek of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection.  “I commend our agent and our law enforcement partners for their hard work and persistence that led to today’s announcement.”
“Today’s multi-billion-dollar penalty holds Wells Fargo accountable for its unlawful sales practices and pressure tactics in which it deceived millions of clients, thus causing substantial hardship for the very individuals who placed their trust in the institution,” said Inspector General Jay N. Lerner Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.  “The FDIC Office of Inspector General is committed to working with our law enforcement partners in order to investigate such financial crimes that harm customers and investors, and undermine the integrity of the banking sector.”
The criminal investigation into false bank records and identity theft is being resolved with a deferred prosecution agreement in which Wells Fargo will not be prosecuted during the three-year term of the agreement if it abides by certain conditions, including continuing to cooperate with further government investigations.  Wells Fargo also entered a civil settlement agreement under the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA) based on Wells Fargo’s creation of false bank records.  FIRREA authorizes the federal government to seek civil penalties against financial institutions that violate various predicate criminal offenses, including false bank records.  Wells Fargo also agreed to the SEC instituting a cease-and-desist proceeding finding violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The $3 billion payment resolves all three matters, and includes a $500 million civil penalty to be distributed by the SEC to investors.
The 16-page statement of facts accompanying the deferred prosecution agreement and civil settlement agreement outlines a course of conduct over 15 years at Well Fargo’s Community Bank, which was then the largest operating segment of Wells Fargo, consistently generating more than half of the company’s revenue.  The statement of facts outlines top Community Bank leaders’ knowledge of the conduct.  As part of the statement of facts, Wells Fargo admitted the following:
Beginning in 1998, Wells Fargo increased its focus on sales volume and reliance on annual sales growth.  A core part of this sales model was the “cross-sell strategy” to sell existing customers additional financial products.  It was “the foundation of our business model,” according to Wells Fargo.  In its 2012 Vision and Values statement, Wells Fargo stated: “We start with what the customer needs – not with what we want to sell them.”
But, in contrast to Wells Fargo’s public statements and disclosures about needs-based selling, the Community Bank implemented a volume-based sales model in which employees were directed and pressured to sell large volumes of products to existing customers, often with little regard to actual customer need or expected use.  The Community Bank’s onerous sales goals and accompanying management pressure led thousands of its employees to engage in unlawful conduct – including fraud, identity theft and the falsification of bank records – and unethical practices to sell product of no or little value to the customer.
Many of these practices were referred to within Wells Fargo as “gaming.”  Gaming strategies varied widely, but included using existing customers’ identities – without their consent – to open checking and savings, debit card, credit card, bill pay and global remittance accounts. From 2002 to 2016, gaming practices included forging customer signatures to open accounts without authorization, creating PINs to activate unauthorized debit cards, moving money from millions of customer accounts to unauthorized accounts in a practice known internally as “simulated funding,” opening credit cards and bill pay products without authorization, altering customers’ true contact information to prevent customers from learning of unauthorized accounts and prevent Wells Fargo employees from reaching customers to conduct customer satisfaction surveys, and encouraging customers to open accounts they neither wanted or needed.
The top managers of the Community Bank were aware of the unlawful and unethical gaming practices as early as 2002, and they knew that the conduct was increasing due to onerous sales goals and pressure from management to meet these goals.  One internal investigator in 2004 called the problem a “growing plague.”  The following year, another internal investigator said the problem was “spiraling out of control.”  Even after senior managers in the Community Bank directly called into question the implementation of the cross-sell strategy, Community Bank senior leadership refused to alter the sales model, which contained unrealistic sales goals and a focus on low-quality secondary accounts.
Despite knowledge of the illegal sales practices, Community Bank senior leadership failed to take sufficient action to prevent and reduce the incidence of such practices.  Senior leadership of the Community Bank minimized the problems to Wells Fargo management and its board of directors, by casting the problem as driven by individual misconduct instead of the sales model itself.  Community Bank senior leadership viewed negative sales quality and integrity as a necessary byproduct of the increased sales and as merely the cost of doing business.
* * *
The government’s decision to enter into the deferred prosecution agreement and civil settlement took into account a number of factors, including Wells Fargo’s extensive cooperation and substantial assistance with the government’s investigations; Wells Fargo’s admission of wrongdoing; its continued cooperation in the investigations; its prior settlements in a series of regulatory and civil actions; and remedial actions, including significant changes in Wells Fargo’s management and its board of directors, an enhanced compliance program, and significant work to identify and compensate customers who may have been victims.  The deferred prosecution agreement will be in effect for three years.
The global settlement also reflects coordination between the Department of Justice and the SEC to ensure a resolution that appropriately addresses the severity of the defendants’ conduct while avoiding the imposition of fines and penalties that are unnecessarily duplicative.
The deferred prosecution agreement was handled by the United States Attorney’s Offices in Los Angeles and Charlotte, with investigative support from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation - Office of Inspector General, the Federal Housing Finance Agency - Office of Inspector General, the Office of Inspector General for the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and the United States Postal Inspection Service.
The civil settlement agreement was the result of a coordinated effort between the Civil Division’s Commercial Litigation Branch and the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Los Angeles.

Former President Of Cecil Bank Facing Federal Indictment For A Bank Fraud Conspiracy, Receiving A Bribe, And Making False Statements In Bank Records And To Bank Examiners
Baltimore, Maryland – A federal grand jury has indicted the former President and Chief Executive Officer of Cecil Bank, Mary Beyer Halsey, age 59, of Rising Sun, Maryland, on the federal charges of conspiracy to commit bank fraud, bank fraud, receipt of a bribe by a bank official, false statement in bank records, and false statement to a bank examiner, in connection with an alleged straw purchase of a home in Rising Sun, Maryland, upon which Cecil Bank had foreclosed.  The indictment was returned on February 13, 2020, and was unsealed at her initial appearance today.
The indictment was announced by United States Attorney for the District of Maryland Robert K. Hur; Special Agent in Charge Mark P. Higgins of Federal Housing Finance Agency, Office of Inspector General (FHFA-OIG), Mid-Atlantic Region; Inspector General Jay N. Lerner of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of Inspector General (FDIC/OIG); Special Inspector General Christy Goldsmith Romero for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (SIGTARP); and Inspector General Hannibal “Mike” Ware of the Small Business Administration, Office of Inspector General (SBA/OIG).
“TARP bailed out banks to stabilize financial institutions, and SIGTARP is charged with investigating fraud in banks while the bank was in TARP,” said Special Inspector General Christy Goldsmith Romero.  “Bankers that break the law to personally enrich themselves will be investigated, caught, and prosecuted.  I thank U.S. Attorney Robert K. Hur and his team for standing with SIGTARP in the fight against TARP-related crime.”
Cecil Bank, located in Elkton, Maryland, had received $11,560,000 in federal taxpayer funds in 2008, under the Capital Purchase Program, as part of the Troubled Asset Relief Program.  On April 20, 2011, Cecil Bank initiated the foreclosure of a single-family house located at 127 Ebenezer Church Road in Rising Sun.  Later that year, Cecil Bank ordered an exterior-only appraisal of the property the showed a market value of $263,000.  On September 10, 2012, Cecil Bank ordered a full appraisal of the property that showed a market value of $295,000.
According to the six-count indictment, from 2012 to 2013, Halsey conspired with Daniel Whitehurst, an employee of a real estate development company that did business in Maryland, to defraud Cecil Bank and another bank to purchase a home through false pretenses, representations and promises.  Specifically, the indictment alleges that Halsey agreed to help Whitehurst to obtain a $650,000 line of credit from Cecil Bank, in exchange for Whitehurst agreeing to serve as the straw purchaser of 127 Ebenezer on behalf of Halsey.
The indictment alleges: that Halsey provided Whitehurst with her personal e-mail address, so that they could communicate about the plans to purchase 127 Ebenezer; Halsey and Whitehurst understated the physical condition of the property; and that they used inappropriate residential properties as comparables to justify the sale price of $150,000 for the property, which was less than its fair market value.  Halsey sought authorization from Cecil Bank’s Board of Directors to sell 127 Ebenezer to Whitehurst, but allegedly did not disclose her personal interest in the property, nor Whitehurst’s role as her nominee to acquire the property on her behalf.
Specifically, the indictment alleges that on March 28, 2012, Halsey and Whitehurst met at a restaurant in Cecil County and Halsey agreed to review Whitehurst’s request for a $650,000 personal line of credit from Cecil Bank in return for Whitehurst agreeing to secretly buy 127 Ebenezer on Halsey’s behalf.  On May 9, 2012, the indictment alleges that Halsey participated in a loan committee meeting at Cecil Bank that considered and approved a $650,000 line for credit for Whitehurst.
As detailed in the indictment, on May 23, 2012, Whitehurst e-mailed Cecil Bank his offer to purchase 127 Ebenezer for $145,000, which has previously been approved by Halsey.  On the same day, during a meeting of the Cecil Bank Board of Directors, Halsey advised the Board that Whitehurst had made a purchase offer of $140,000 for 127 Ebenezer, $5,000 less the actual offer, and further noted that the property had “structural deficiencies and will require significant repairs.” The Board authorized Halsey to “negotiate the best price.”  Thereafter, Whitehurst submitted a contract for him to purchase 127 Ebenezer from Cecil Bank for $150,000, which Halsey signed on August 17, 2012 on behalf of Cecil Bank.
According to the indictment, in October 2012, Whitehurst applied for and obtained a $100,000 loan from another bank to purchase 127 Ebenezer, fraudulently claiming that he was purchasing the property for himself.  The indictment alleges that Halsey subsequently wired $75,000 to Whitehurst’s bank account prior to the settlement of 127 Ebenezer to cover the cost of the down payment as well as closing costs and upgrades to the property that Halsey directed Whitehurst to arrange.  On November 21, 2012, the settlement of 127 Ebenezer was held with Halsey representing Cecil Bank as the seller, and Whitehurst as the purported purchaser, selling the property to Whitehurst for $150,000.  In December 2012, in response to a question from a bank examiner for the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond inquiring about the sale of the property to Whitehurst, Halsey falsely stated that she was “not totally familiar with [that] property” and that the bank had difficulty marketing the property and had not listed it with a realtor because of “issues with the county over the bonds outstanding.”
Finally, the indictment alleges that Halsey and Whitehurst exchanged e-mails concerning money Halsey owed Whitehurst for improving and maintaining 127 Ebenezer, including the monthly mortgage payment and loan fees on the $100,000 loan he had secured from Rosedale Federal to purchase the property for Halsey.  Halsey allegedly issued three checks to Whitehurst totaling $60,000 in response to Whitehurst’s request.
If convicted, Halsey faces a maximum sentence of 30 years in federal prison for each offense (all 6 counts have maximum sentence of 30 years): 1 Count of Conspiracy to commit bank fraud; 2 Counts of Bank Fraud; 1 Count of Receipt of Bribe by Bank Official; 1 Count of False Statement in Records; and 1 Count of False Statement to a Bank Examiner.  Actual sentences for federal crimes are typically less than the maximum penalties. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after taking into account the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.  At today’s initial appearance in U.S. District Court in Baltimore, U.S. Magistrate Judge Thomas DiGirolamo ordered that Halsey be released pending trial under the supervision of U.S. Pretrial Services.
An indictment is not a finding of guilt.  An individual charged by indictment is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty at some later criminal proceedings.
Daniel Whitehurst, age 35, of Bel Air, Maryland, pleaded guilty under seal to mail fraud on April 6, 2018.  His guilty plea was also unsealed today.  Whitehurst faces a maximum sentence of 30 years in federal prison for conspiracy to commit bank fraud.  U.S. District Judge Deborah K. Chasanow has not scheduled a date for sentencing.
United States Attorney Robert K. Hur commended the FHFA-OIG, Mid-Atlantic Region; FDIC/OIG; SIGTARP; and SBA/OIG for their work in the investigation.  Mr. Hur thanked Assistant U.S. Attorneys Martin J. Clarke and Harry M. Gruber, who are prosecuting the case.

Man Sentenced for Embezzling $3 Million from Employer
ALEXANDRIA, Va. – A Maryland man was sentenced today to 30 months in prison for embezzling over $3.2 million from his employer.
According to court documents, Reginald Zayas, 49, of Upper Marlboro, was the Controller at a Virginia-based company. Over the course of almost four years, Zayas embezzled over $3.2 million from the company by unlawfully transferring funds from the company’s bank account to his own bank account, and he then often transferred the money from his account to others. Zayas transferred over $300,000 to accounts controlled by his wife, his girlfriend, and the mother of one of his children.
Zayas used the laundered money to pay for his own personal expenses, including exorbitant credit card bills, car payments, dining expenses and entertainment, and private school tuition.
In addition to the prison sentence, Zayas was also ordered to pay full restitution and forfeiture.
G. Zachary Terwilliger, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia; Timothy M. Dunham, Special Agent in Charge, Criminal Division, FBI Washington Field Office; and Jay N. Lerner, Inspector General of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC-OIG), made the announcement after sentencing by Senior U.S. District Judge Claude M. Hilton.

Former Stockman Bank employee sentenced to prison for stealing from customers
BILLINGS—A former Stockman Bank commercial loan assistant who admitted stealing money from the accounts of two customers, including a mentally incompetent elderly man, was sentenced today to 57 months in prison and five years of supervised release and ordered to pay $195,949 restitution, U.S. Attorney Kurt Alme said.
Shawn Al Logan, 31, of Shepherd, pleaded guilty in October to theft, embezzlement, misapplication by bank employee, engaging in monetary transactions in criminally derived property and aggravated identity theft.
U.S. District Judge Susan Watters presided and continued Logan’s release pending assignment by the Bureau of Prisons.
In court documents filed in the case, the prosecution said Logan, a commercial loan assistant, fraudulently obtained or attempted to obtain more than $243,000 in customer funds for his personal benefit. Logan worked on customer accounts of an elderly man who was mentally incompetent and interacted with the man’s representative, who had power of attorney. The representative lived in Florida, was authorized to handle the man’s accounts and traveled to Billings a few times a year.
Beginning in September 2017, Logan made unauthorized withdrawals from the man’s account for his own benefit by issuing debit cards in the representative’s name. When the representative confronted Logan about unauthorized debit transactions, Logan made a series of misrepresentations to the representative, all designed to hide what had actually occurred.
Logan also made a series of unauthorized internal transfers from the account of another Stockman bank customer to the elderly man’s account, from which Logan would pay his own creditors and make deposits into his own accounts.
When interviewed by the bank, Logan initially said all of the flagged internal bank transfers and checks were approved by Stockman customers. However, when confronted by evidence concerning one of the checks payable to his American Express account, Logan said he did not want to answer any more questions.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Zeno Baucus prosecuted the case, which was investigated by the FBI, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s Office of Inspector General and the IRS.

Top Executives Plead Guilty to Participating in a Billion Dollar Ponzi Scheme—the Biggest Criminal Fraud Scheme in the History of the Eastern District of California,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/top-executives-plead-guilty-participating-billion-dollar-ponzi,"January 24, 2020",2020,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Top Executives Plead Guilty to Participating in a Billion Dollar Ponzi Scheme—the Biggest Criminal Fraud Scheme in the History of the Eastern District of California
SACRAMENTO, Calif. — The owners of DC Solar, a Benicia-based company, pleaded guilty today to charges related to a billion dollar Ponzi scheme— the biggest criminal fraud scheme in the history of the Eastern District of California. The government’s investigation has resulted in the largest criminal forfeiture in the history of the District with over $120 million in assets forfeited that will go to victims, and has returned $500 million to the United States Treasury, with more to come, U.S. Attorney McGregor W. Scott announced.
Jeff Carpoff, 49, of Martinez, pleaded guilty today to conspiracy to commit wire fraud and money laundering. His wife, Paulette Carpoff, 46, pleaded guilty today to conspiracy to commit an offense against the United States and money laundering. According to court documents, between 2011 and 2018, DC Solar manufactured mobile solar generator units (MSG), solar generators that were mounted on trailers that were promoted as able to provide emergency power to cellphone towers and lighting at sporting events. A significant incentive for investors were generous federal tax credits due to the solar nature of the MSGs.
The conspirators pulled off their scheme by selling solar generators that did not exist to investors, making it appear that solar generators existed in locations that they did not, creating false financial statements, and obtaining false lease contracts, among other efforts to conceal the fraud. In reality, at least half of the approximately 17,000 solar generators claimed to have been manufactured by DC Solar did not exist.
U.S. Attorney Scott stated: “This billion dollar Ponzi scheme hurt investors and took money from the United States Treasury. This case represents not only the largest criminal fraud scheme in the history of the District, it also represents the largest criminal forfeiture in the history of the District with over $120 million in assets forfeited. All of this money will be returned to the victims. This scheme also targeted the United States Treasury, and we have returned $500 million to the Treasury to date. Agents, investigators and attorneys from various federal agencies are still working to continue to return money to victims and the United States Treasury. Today’s guilty pleas sends a strong message that fraudsters will get caught and will pay for their crimes. You can run, but you cannot hide.”
The forfeiture included seizing and auctioning 148 of the Carpoffs’ luxury and collector vehicles, including the 1978 Firebird previously owned by actor Burt Reynolds. This historical auction resulted in recouping approximately $8.233 million for victims. In addition to their collection of luxury and collector vehicles, Jeff and Paulette Carpoff used money from the scheme to pay for a minor-league professional baseball team and a NASCAR racecar sponsorship; to purchase luxury real estate in California, Nevada, the Caribbean, Mexico, and elsewhere; a subscription private jet service; a suite at a professional football stadium; and jewelry.
“The Carpoffs and their co-conspirators wove a web of lies and deceit in a massive fraud scheme. Meticulous review and analysis of millions of documents revealed the operation and true intention of the scheme,” said Special Agent in Charge Sean Ragan. “The FBI is committed to our partnerships with the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General, and U.S. Marshals Service. Together, we seek to uncover fraud that exploits investors and taxpayers, ensuring criminals face justice.”
“By all outer appearances this was a legitimate and successful company,” said Kareem Carter, Special Agent in Charge IRS Criminal Investigation. “But in reality it was all just smoke and mirrors — a Ponzi scheme touting tax benefits to the tune of over $900 million. IRS CI is committed to investigating those who take advantage and impact the financial well-being of others for their own personal gain.”
“The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of Inspector General (FDIC-OIG) is pleased to join our law enforcement colleagues in announcing these guilty pleas,” stated Special Agent in Charge Wade Walters for the FDIC OIG San Francisco Regional Office. “The defendants conspired with others to create a fraudulent business venture that duped unsuspecting entities, including banks, to invest approximately $1 billion, which the two later used to support a lavish lifestyle. They also knowingly engaged in a money laundering transaction involving criminally derived property. The FDIC-OIG is committed to ensuring that those who use our Nation’s banks to undermine the integrity of the financial system will be held accountable.”
Four defendants have previously pleaded guilty to federal criminal charges related to the fraud scheme since October. Joseph W. Bayliss, 44, of Martinez, and Ronald J. Roach, of Walnut Creek, each pleaded guilty to related charges on Oct. 22, 2019. Robert A. Karmann, 53, of Clayton, pleaded guilty to related charges on Dec. 17, 2019. Ryan Guidry, 53, of Pleasant Hill, pleaded guilty to related charges on Jan. 14, 2020. A seventh co-conspirator is scheduled to plead guilty on Feb. 11. The investigation into the fraud remains ongoing.
This case is the product of an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, IRS‑Criminal Investigation, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General. Assistant U.S. Attorneys André M. Espinosa and Kevin C. Khasigian are prosecuting the case.
Jeff and Paulette Carpoff are scheduled to be sentenced by U.S. District Judge John A. Mendez on May 19. Jeff Carpoff faces a maximum statutory penalty of 30 years in prison. Paulette Carpoff faces a maximum statutory penalty of 15 years in prison. The actual sentences, however, will be determined at the discretion of the court after consideration of any applicable statutory factors and the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, which take into account a number of variables.

Minnesota Couple Sentenced to Prison for Long-Running Fraud Scheme
Real Estate Company Ordered to Pay Criminal Fine and Restitution
Detloff Marketing and Asset Management Inc. (Detloff Marketing), a real estate company based in Hopkins, Minnesota; its owner, Jeffrey J. Detloff; and its accountant, Lori K. Detloff, were sentenced today in the U.S. District Court in St. Paul, Minnesota, for their participation in a long-running fraudulent bidding and kickback scheme in connection with foreclosed properties, the Department of Justice announced.
Jeffrey Detloff was sentenced to 16 months’ imprisonment and two years of supervised release. Lori Detloff was sentenced to seven months’ imprisonment and one year of supervised release. Detloff Marketing was sentenced to a pay a $593,000 criminal fine. The defendants were also sentenced to pay full restitution to the victims of the scheme.
“Today’s sentences reflect the significant harm caused by the defendants’ years long scheme that lined their pockets by defrauding lenders and undermining competition,” said Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim of the Department of Justice’s Antitrust Division. “The Antitrust Division and its partners are committed to rooting out anticompetitive conduct, whatever its form, and holding companies and executives accountable.”
“The defendants created a scheme to squeeze as much money as they could from these properties with no regard for the victim,” said FBI Special Agent in Charge Jill Sanborn of the Minneapolis Division. “These scams victimize a large number of people and the FBI along with our law enforcement partners will continue to work these schemes and hold accountable those responsible for defrauding the system.”
According to court documents, from September 2007 and continuing until June 2015, Jeffrey Detloff, of Minnetonka, Minnesota, conspired to defraud mortgage lenders and guarantors who had hired Detloff, a realtor, to oversee maintenance and repairs on foreclosed homes in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area. Jeffrey Detloff steered maintenance and repair contracts to contractors who would pay a kickback to Detloff Marketing. Unbeknownst to his customers, Jeffrey Detloff and Detloff Marketing included the kickbacks within bids and invoices sent to the lender or guarantor for reimbursement on maintenance and repairs. Lori Detloff, also of Minnetonka, Minnesota, was an accountant responsible for ensuring the kickbacks were paid by contractors to Detloff Marketing. In all, Detloff Marketing received over $291,505 in kickbacks.
Detloff Marketing and Jeffery Detloff pleaded guilty to Count 1 of the Indictment, which charged a conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud affecting a financial institution.  Lori Detloff pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting the principal offense described in Count 4 of the indictment, mail fraud affecting a financial institution.  As part of their plea agreements, the Antitrust Division agreed to move to dismiss the remaining counts against Detloff Marketing, Jeffery Detloff, and Lori Detloff upon sentencing.
The underlying investigation of housing repair contracts in the Minneapolis area is being conducted by the Antitrust Division’s Chicago Office and the FBI’s Minneapolis Division. Anyone with information on customer allocation, bid rigging, price fixing, or other anticompetitive conduct related to the real estate industry in Minnesota should contact the Antitrust Division’s Chicago Office at 312-984-7200 or visit www.justice.gov/atr/contact/newcase.html .

Fourth Conspirator Pleads Guilty to Participation in a Ponzi Scheme Involving $2.5B in Transactions and $1B in Loss,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/fourth-conspirator-pleads-guilty-participation-ponzi-scheme,"January 14, 2020",2020,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Fourth Conspirator Pleads Guilty to Participation in a Ponzi Scheme Involving $2.5B in Transactions and $1B in Loss
SACRAMENTO, Calif. — Ryan Guidry, 43, of Pleasant Hill, pleaded guilty today to participating in a massive fraud scheme involving a solar energy company in Benicia that defrauded investors of approximately $1 billion, U.S. Attorney McGregor W. Scott announced.
Those losses resulted from investment transactions in solar energy hardware valued at approximately $2.5 billion. Guidry also pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting money laundering. Guidry is the fourth person to plead guilty to federal criminal charges relating to the fraud scheme since October.
According to court documents, between 2011 and 2018, the solar energy company manufactured mobile solar generator units (MSG), solar generators that were mounted on trailers. The company touted the versatility and environmental sustainability of the MSGs and claimed that they were used by cellphone companies to provide emergency power to cell towers in the case of a power failure. They were also claimed to be used to power lights at sporting and other events.
The company solicited investors by claiming that there were very favorable federal tax benefits associated with investments in alternative energy. The company structured the transactions in order to maximize the tax benefits to the investors. Investors would buy the MSGs without ever taking possession of them. They would pay a percentage of the sales price and finance the balance with the company. Then the investors would lease the MSGs back to the company, which in turn leased them to third parties. A portion of the lease revenue would be used to pay the investors’ debts to the company and to the investors. The third‑party leases, however, generated little income and the company paid early investors with funds contributed by later investors.
According to court documents, Guidry joined the company in 2012 and became its Vice President of Operations. Guidry and his co-conspirators used fraudulent financial statements and other false information to hide from investors the company’s use of later investor payments to pay financial obligations the company made to earlier investors — in a classic Ponzi scheme. Additionally, Guidry accepted $1 million from a co-conspirator to obtain an unauthorized signature on a false contract his co-conspirator later used to induce investments by victims. In another instance, Guidry accepted $20,000 from that co-conspirator to obtain a signature on a related false contract, which the co-conspirator also used to induce an investment by victims. Guidry and another conspirator signed that second contract using a fake name and shared the $20,000. During the conspiracy, Guidry also worked with co-conspirators to frustrate certain investors’ inspections of MSGs to conceal from those investors the fact that the company had not built the MSGs it sold to those investors. For example, in advance of an inspection, Guidry and certain co-conspirators scraped off VIN number stickers identifying MSGs sold to one investor and replaced them with VIN number stickers identifying MSGs sold to a later investor. On another occasion, Guidry and his co-conspirators coordinated the delivery of MSGs to field inspection sites before and on the day of an inspection to trick the inspectors into believing those MSGs had been deployed at those sites all along, when they had not.
Joseph W. Bayliss, 44, of Martinez, and Ronald J. Roach, of Walnut Creek, each pleaded guilty to related charges on Oct. 22, 2019. Robert A. Karmann, 53, of Clayton, pleaded guilty to related charges on Dec. 17, 2019. The investigation into the fraud remains ongoing.
This case is the product of an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, IRS‑Criminal Investigation, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General. Assistant U.S. Attorneys André M. Espinosa and Kevin C. Khasigian are prosecuting the case.
Guidry is scheduled to be sentenced by U.S. District Judge John A. Mendez on April 21. Guidry faces a maximum statutory penalty of 15 years in prison. The actual sentence, however, will be determined at the discretion of the court after consideration of any applicable statutory factors and the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, which take into account a number of variables.

Former Chief Lending Officer Of New Jersey Bank Admits Making False Statements To United States In An Effort To Secure Federal Guarantees On Loans,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/former-chief-lending-officer-new-jersey-bank-admits-making-false,"January 8, 2020",2020,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Former Chief Lending Officer Of New Jersey Bank Admits Making False Statements To United States In An Effort To Secure Federal Guarantees On Loans
TRENTON, N.J. – A Pennsylvania man today admitted improperly securing a federal guarantee on a loan by making false statements to the Small Business Administration (SBA) about the creditworthiness of those loans while serving as the chief lending officer of a New Jersey bank, U.S. Attorney Craig Carpenito announced.
James Bortolotti, 51, pleaded guilty before U.S. District Judge Michael Shipp in Trenton federal court to an information charging him with one count of knowingly making false statements for the purpose of influencing the action of the SBA.
According to documents filed in this case and statements made in court:
While serving as the chief lending officer of a New Jersey bank (Bank-1), Bortolotti became aware of a Small Business Administration lending program to incentivize lenders, including banks, to loan money to small businesses by providing a 75 percent SBA-backed guarantee on loans. When a lender applies an SBA guarantee on a loan, the lender must disclose information related to the creditworthiness of the small business. Bank-1 hired a consulting firm to help the bank apply for SBA-backed guarantees.
On Feb. 29, 2012, a consultant from the consulting firm submitted an application to the SBA for a guarantee of approximately $3.75 million on loans totaling approximately $5 million made to a small business located in Robbinsville, New Jersey. The application contained false information related to the creditworthiness of the business. Bortolotti knew the application contained false information, but reviewed and signed the application on behalf of the bank.
Making false statements for the purpose of influencing the action of the SBA carries a maximum potential penalty of 30 years in prison and a $1 million fine. Sentencing is scheduled for April 16, 2020.

C.E.O. And Founder Of Cash Flow Partners Charged With Multimillion-Dollar Bank Fraud And Securities Fraud Scheme
NEWARK, N.J. – A Passaic County, New Jersey, man was charged today for a multi-million dollar bank fraud and securities fraud scheme operated through his company, Cash Flow Partners LLC (Cash Flow), U.S. Attorney Craig Carpenito announced.
Edward Espinal, 44, of Wayne, New Jersey, was charged by complaint with one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud and one count of securities fraud. He is scheduled to have his initial appearance this afternoon before U.S. Magistrate Judge Cathy L. Waldor in Newark federal court.
According to documents filed in this case and statements made in court:
The Bank Fraud Conspiracy
Espinal was the founder and chief executive officer (CEO) of Cash Flow, and controlled the company’s operations. From March 2016 through December 2019, Espinal led and directed a bank fraud conspiracy designed to obtain millions of dollars in loans from banks on the basis of false representations. To attract customers, Cash Flow released internet advertisements and held seminars offering to assist customers with low-paying salaries in obtaining loans. These advertisements included promotional videos featuring Espinal and a former telenovela actor. Customers contacted Cash Flow and were routed to the company’s sales department.
Employees in the sales department then encouraged customers to sign up for various loan programs that Cash Flow provided and to enter into contracts with Cash Flow. Under those contracts, employees would help customers obtain loans from banks. The Cash Flow contracts permitted customers to keep a portion of the loan proceeds and customers agreed to provide the remaining percentage of the proceeds to Cash Flow. Cash Flow agreed to pay off the loans on behalf of its customers.
Cash Flow then used false information and fraudulent document to obtain loans for its customers for which they otherwise would not have qualified, and posed as the customers in communications with the banks.
The Securities Fraud Scheme
From July 2016 through September 2019, Espinal obtained more than $5 million in investments from victim investors on the basis of false and fraudulent pretenses and representations.
Espinal solicited investments from prospective customers using a marketing campaign on Spanish language television channels and the internet, the “Cash Flow TV” YouTube page, and live presentations in Cash Flow’s offices and elsewhere. Espinal also solicited investments from individuals who obtained loans through Cash Flow’s bank fraud conspiracy, encouraging loan customers to invest loan proceeds in Cash Flow’s investment program. Once investors agreed to invest in Cash Flow, Espinal issued “promissory notes” to investors that guaranteed monthly investment returns between 1.25 percent and 4 percent. The promissory notes stated that Cash Flow would return investors’ principal either one year from the date of the promissory note, or 60 days after investors demanded payment. Espinal and other Cash Flow employees signed the promissory notes on behalf of Cash Flow.
Espinal made a number of misrepresentations to investors. He told investors that he would pool their funds with the funds of other investors in investments related to real estate, real estate companies, a gold mine in Ecuador, and construction projects in countries outside of the United States. In reality, Espinal used investor funds to pay returns to earlier investors, to pay for personal expenses for himself, his family, and another Cash Flow employee, to perpetuate the bank fraud scheme, and to market the bank fraud and investment scheme to future victims. Espinal falsely claimed that Cash Flow’s purported real estate fund, Cash Flow Capital, was “licensed” by the Securities and Exchange Commission. He guaranteed monthly returns on investment based on the purported proceeds from the sale of properties in Cash Flow’s investment portfolio. In reality, Espinal did not sell Cash Flow properties, so no profits were derived from the sale of Cash Flow properties.
Two other individuals, Raymundo Torres and Jennie Frias, have previously been charged for their roles in the Cash Flow bank fraud conspiracy. Torres has pleaded guilty.
The conspiracy to commit bank fraud charge carries a maximum potential penalty of 30 years in prison and a $1 million fine. The securities fraud counts carry a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and a $5 million fine.
Individuals who believe they may have information about this case may contact the FBI at 1-800-CALL-FBI (225-5324).
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) also filed a civil complaint against Espinal today based on the allegations underlying the securities fraud charge.
U.S. Attorney Carpenito credited special agents of the FDIC-Office of the Inspector General (FDIC-OIG), under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Patricia Tarasca in New York, and special agents of the FBI, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Gregory W. Ehrie in Newark, with the investigation leading to today’s charges. He also thanked the SEC for the assistance provided by its Enforcement Division.
The government is represented by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Ari B. Fontecchio of the Economic Crimes Unit and J. Stephen Ferketic of the U.S. Attorney’s Office Opioid Abuse Prevention and Enforcement Unit in Newark.
The charges and allegations contained in the complaints are merely accusations, and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.

Former Bank President Who Aided the Obstruction of an FDIC Investigation Sentenced
Court Also Ordered Defendant to Pay More than $460,000 in Restitution
A former bank president who aided the obstruction of an FDIC examination was sentenced today to 5 years’ probation.
Cecil Capper, age 74, from Marion, Iowa, received the probation term after a June 25, 2019 guilty plea to aiding and abetting the obstruction of an FDIC investigation.
Information at sentencing showed that Capper worked as a bank president from 2009 to 2013, and that in December 2010 Capper prepared a handwritten memo and made an entry in the bank’s computer system purporting to show that Capper’s bank had assumed a $500,000 loan from another affiliated bank.  Capper did so in order to aid in concealing underlying delinquent loans from FDIC scrutiny.  The bank ended up being unable to collect on the majority of the $500,000 loan, ultimately losing $462,304.84.
Capper was sentenced in Cedar Rapids by United States District Court Judge C.J. Williams.  Capper was sentenced to 5 years’ probation.  He was ordered to make $462,304.84 in restitution.
The case was prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Anthony Morfitt and investigated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General and the United States Secret Service.

Former CB&T City Bank President, Co-Conspirators Involved In $5+ Million Fraud Scheme Sentenced To Prison, Ordered To Pay Back Millions
Macon, Ga. – Three co-conspirators involved in a multi-million dollar scheme to defraud millions from Citizens Bank and Trust (CB&T) have been sentenced for their crimes, announced Charles “Charlie” Peeler, the United States Attorney for the Middle District of Georgia. On Monday, December 16, 2019, former CB&T City Bank President McDonald Hardin, 57, of Kathleen, Georgia was sentenced to 60 months imprisonment, three years supervised release and ordered to pay $1,437,651.07 in restitution to CB&T and $1,900,000 in restitution to Progressive Insurance after pleading guilty on May 2, 2019 to count one of a 14 count indictment charging him with conspiracy to commit bank fraud. His co-conspirator, Steve Stokeling, 55, formerly of Warner Robins, Georgia, was sentenced to 78 months imprisonment, five years supervised release and ordered to pay $28,832.15 in restitution to CB&T after pleading guilty on May 2, 2019 to count nine of a 14 count indictment charging him with bank fraud. This morning, the third co-conspirator, Joseph Askew, 43, of Perry, Georgia, was sentenced to 18 months imprisonment, one year supervised release and ordered to pay $1,437,651.07 in restitution to CB&T and $120,765.10 in restitution to Progressive Insurance after pleading guilty on January 30, 2018 to one count information charging the defendant with conspiracy to commit bank fraud. U.S. District Judge Marc Treadwell presided over the sentencings. There is no parole in the federal system.
Beginning in February 2008 through August of 2010, Hardin, the City President and Senior Lending Officer at the CB&T Warner Robins branch, participated in a loan scheme designed to generate loan proceeds from fraudulent loans to Stokeling and Askew, their friends and family members, and borrowers recruited by Stokeling and Askew who would sign loan documents without any expectation of receiving the loan proceeds. Hardin approved the loans, and CB&T would issue checks. The loan money was distributed to various persons, including defendant Stokeling for his personal gain, and not used for the intended purposes of the loan, like the purchase of cars or homes. In all, CB&T was defrauded of $5,067,333.17.
“Community banks are a cornerstone of our local economy. They employ our citizens, fund local businesses, support local organizations and bank our families. When criminals defraud local banks our office will prosecute them to the fullest extent of the law,” said U.S. Attorney Charlie Peeler. “The FDIC-OIG initiated this investigation after a tip from within CB&T. The FBI and FDIC-OIG did a tremendous job getting to the bottom of this complex loan scheme, and helping root out the fraud.”
“These sentencings hold the conspirators accountable for defrauding the bank of more than $5 million in a scheme designed to line their pockets,” said FDIC Inspector General Jay N. Lerner.  “We are committed to working with our law enforcement partners to preserve the integrity of the banking system against insiders who abuse their positions to commit fraud.”
“The sentencing of these three subjects brings to a close a lengthy investigation and prosecution of a criminal enterprise that obtained fraudulent loans that caused extensive damage to a local community bank,” said Chris Hacker, Special Agent in Charge of FBI Atlanta. “This case is an example of the FBI’s commitment to combatting such criminal actions that defraud hard working citizens.”
The case was investigated by the FDIC-OIG and the FBI. Assistant U.S. Attorney Shanelle Booker prosecuted the case for the Government. Questions can be directed to Pamela Lightsey, Public Information Officer, United States Attorney’s Office, at (478) 621-2603 or Melissa Hodges, Public Affairs Director (Contractor), United States Attorney’s Office, at (478) 765-2362.

Former Executives and Employees of Health Technology Start-Up Charged in a $1 Billion Scheme to Defraud Clients, Lenders and Investors
Four former executives and two former employees of Outcome Health (Outcome), a Chicago-based health technology start-up company founded in 2006, were charged for their alleged roles in a fraud scheme that targeted the company’s clients, lenders and investors, and involved approximately $1 billion in fraudulently obtained funds.
Charged in a superseding indictment filed in the Northern District of Illinois and unsealed today are:
Charged in an information filed in the same district are:
An initial appearance and arraignment for Shah, Agarwal and Purdy in federal court in Chicago have not yet been scheduled. An initial appearance and arraignment for Desai are set for Dec. 3, 2019, at 10:00 a.m., before U.S. District Judge Thomas M. Durkin.
An initial appearance and arraignment for Choi and Han are set for Dec. 5, 2019, at 1:30 p.m., before U.S. Magistrate Judge Jeffrey Gilbert.
“Outcome’s former executives and employees allegedly deceived lenders, investors, and their own auditors by falsely representing revenue for additional profit,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General John P. Cronan of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division.  “The charges announced today demonstrate that lies and deception cannot serve as the basis for any company, including start-up companies, to falsely grow revenue for additional capital and private gain.”
“The deception alleged to have been committed by the defendants tricked clients into paying for advertising it failed to deliver and served to falsely inflate the value of Outcome Health,” said Assistant U.S. Attorney Brian Hayes, Chief of the Criminal Division for the Northern District of Illinois.  “Our office will continue to investigate and hold accountable those who perpetrate fraud schemes.”
“These charges demonstrate that the FBI and its partners will hold businesses accountable for their misconduct,” said Deputy Special Agent in Charge Larry L. Lapp of the FBI’s Chicago Field Office.
“The defendants were charged with allegedly over-inflating the company’s revenue figures in order to fraudulently obtain loans from banks,” said Inspector General Jay N. Lerner of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s Office of Inspector General (FDIC-OIG).  “This scheme was orchestrated by former leaders of the organization who personally benefitted from hundreds of millions of dollars.  We are committed to working with our law enforcement partners to investigate individuals involved in the crime and to preserve the integrity of the banking system.”
As alleged in the superseding indictment and information, from 2011 to 2017, the former executives and employees of Outcome, a digital provider of medical information and advertising in doctors’ offices, sold tens of millions of dollars of advertising inventory that did not exist.  This allegedly resulted in inflated financial statements that the former executives used to raise nearly $1 billion in debt and equity financing in 2016 and 2017.  Shah, Agarwal and Purdy are each charged with various counts of mail fraud, wire fraud and bank fraud.  Purdy is also charged with one count of false statements to a financial institution, and Shah is also charged with two counts of transactions in criminal proceeds.  Desai is charged with one count of wire fraud.  Choi and Han are each charged with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud.
According to the allegations, the former executives and employees perpetrated a fraudulent scheme by selling clients—most of whom were pharmaceutical companies—advertising inventory the company did not have and then under-delivering on its advertising campaigns.  Despite these under-deliveries, the company allegedly still invoiced its clients as if it had delivered in full.  To conceal the under-deliveries, the former executives and employees allegedly falsified affidavits and proofs of performance to make it appear the company was delivering advertising content to the number of screens in its clients’ contracts, and also inflated patient engagement metrics regarding how frequently patients engaged with Outcome’s tablets.  Furthermore, Desai allegedly altered a number of studies presented to clients to make it appear that the campaigns were more effective than they actually were.
The charging documents also allege that the under-delivery resulted in a material overstatement of Outcome’s revenue for the years 2015 and 2016.  The company’s outside auditor signed off on the 2015 and 2016 revenue numbers because Purdy, Desai, Choi and Han allegedly fabricated data to conceal the under-deliveries from the auditor.  Shah, Purdy and Agarwal then allegedly used the inflated revenue figures in Outcome’s 2015 and 2016 audited financial statements to raise $110 million in debt financing in April 2016, $375 million in debt financing in December 2016 and $487.5 million in equity financing in early 2017.  The $110 million debt financing allegedly resulted in a $30.2 million dividend to Shah and a $7.5 million dividend to Agarwal; the $487.5 million equity financing allegedly resulted in a $225 million dividend to Shah and Agarwal.
An indictment is merely an allegation, and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.
The FBI and FDIC-OIG are investigating the case.  Assistant Chief William E. Johnston and Trial Attorney Kyle C. Hankey of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Matthew F. Madden of the Northern District of Illinois are prosecuting the case.  Daniel Olinghouse of the Criminal Division’s Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section has assisted with forfeiture matters.

Former Trader for Major Multinational Bank Convicted for Price Fixing and Bid Rigging in FX Market,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/former-trader-major-multinational-bank-convicted-price-fixing,"November 20, 2019",2019,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Former Trader for Major Multinational Bank Convicted for Price Fixing and Bid Rigging in FX Market
A former currency trader was convicted today in New York for his participation in an antitrust conspiracy to manipulate prices for emerging market currencies in the global foreign currency exchange (FX) market, the Justice Department announced today.
Following a three-week trial in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, a jury convicted Akshay Aiyer (former Executive Director at a major multinational bank) of conspiring to fix prices and rig bids in Central and Eastern European, Middle Eastern and African (CEEMEA) currencies, which were generally traded against the U.S. dollar and the euro, from at least October 2010 through at least January 2013.
“Today, a jury of citizens held the defendant accountable for fixing prices and rigging bids for emerging market currencies traded in the United States and elsewhere,” said Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim of the Department of Justice’s Antitrust Division.  “This conviction serves as a reminder of our commitment to hold individuals responsible for their involvement in complex financial schemes which violate the integrity of the global financial markets.”
“Today’s verdict holds the defendant accountable for manipulating the foreign currency market for his own benefit at the expense of free and open competition,” said Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) Inspector General Jay N. Lerner.  “We are dedicated to working with our law enforcement partners to investigate such complex crimes which undermine the integrity of financial markets, and to bring bank insiders to justice.”
According to evidence presented at trial, the defendant engaged in near-daily communications with his co-conspirators by phone, text and through an exclusive electronic chat room to coordinate their trades of the CEEMEA currencies in the FX spot market.  The jury heard evidence that the defendant and his co-conspirators manipulated exchange rates by agreeing to withhold bids or offers to avoid moving the exchange rate in a direction adverse to open positions held by co-conspirators and by coordinating their trading to manipulate the rates in an effort to increase their profits.  By agreeing not to buy or sell at certain times, the conspiring traders protected each other’s trading positions by withholding supply of or demand for currency and suppressing competition in the FX spot market for emerging market currencies.  They also heard evidence that the defendant and his co-conspirators took steps to conceal their actions by, among other steps, using code names, communicating on personal cell phones during work hours and meeting in person to discuss particular customers and trading strategies.
The Antitrust Division has charged five companies and six individuals in its investigation of collusion in the FX spot market. On May 20, 2015, four major banks – Citicorp, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Barclays PLC and The Royal Bank of Scotland plc – pleaded guilty and agreed to pay collectively more than $2.5 billion in criminal fines for their participation in an antitrust conspiracy in the euro-U.S. dollar FX spot market. On Jan. 25, 2018, BNP Paribas USA Inc. pleaded guilty and agreed to pay a $90 million criminal fine for its participation in an antitrust conspiracy involving emerging market FX prices. On Jan. 4, 2017 and Jan. 12, 2017 , plea agreements were announced for two former traders in connection with an antitrust conspiracy involving emerging market FX prices.
The Antitrust Division’s investigation of collusion in the financial markets is ongoing.  The investigation in today’s case is being conducted by the FDIC Office of Inspector General and the FBI’s Washington Field Office, and the prosecution is being handled by the Antitrust Division’s New York Office.  The Criminal Division’s Fraud Section also provided substantial assistance in this matter.  Anyone with information on price fixing, bid rigging or other anticompetitive conduct in the financial markets should contact the Antitrust Division’s New York Office at 212-335-8000 or visit www.justice.gov/atr/contact/newcase.html .

Former Park Avenue Bank Director Mendel Zilberberg And Co-Conspirator Charged In $1.4 Million Bank Fraud,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/former-park-avenue-bank-director-mendel-zilberberg-and-co,"November 12, 2019",2019,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Former Park Avenue Bank Director Mendel Zilberberg And Co-Conspirator Charged In $1.4 Million Bank Fraud
Geoffrey S. Berman, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, William F. Sweeney Jr., Assistant Director-in-Charge of the New York Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”), and Jay N. Lerner, Inspector General of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), announced today the unsealing of an Indictment charging attorney MENDEL ZILBERBERG, a former director of Park Avenue Bank (the “Bank”), and ARON FRIED with bank fraud and related charges for perpetrating a fraudulent scheme to obtain a $1.4 million loan from the Bank.  The defendants caused the Bank to issue the loan to a straw borrower on the basis of false statements and misrepresentations, when in fact the defendants received and used the loan proceeds, resulting in a loss of over $1 million to the Bank when the loan defaulted.  ZILBERBERG was also separately charged with embezzlement and misappropriation of Bank funds while he was a director and insider of the Bank.  ZILBERBERG and FRIED were arrested this morning and will be presented later today before U.S. Magistrate Judge Katharine H. Parker.  The case has been assigned to U.S. District Judge George B. Daniels.
Manhattan U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman said:  “As alleged, Mendel Zilberberg and Aron Fried conspired with another to defraud the bank where Zilberberg served as a director.  In a textbook case of self-dealing and breach of fiduciary duty, Zilberberg allegedly exploited his position at the bank to grease the skids for a loan given under blatantly false pretenses, a huge chunk of the proceeds of which he himself dipped into.”
FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge William F. Sweeney Jr said:  “As alleged, when Fried and his co-conspirator realized they wouldn’t be able to secure a loan the traditional way – by legitimately obtaining the money from an authorized financial institution – they brought a straw borrower and bank director into their circle to effectively carry out the fraudulent activity.  As alleged, Mendel Zilberberg, the bank’s director, played a key role in carrying out this scheme, driving the loan through the approval process while shrouding the details in secrecy.  When the bank realized a loss of more than $1 million, the defendants allegedly walked away with the money from the defaulted loan.  Making false statements and misrepresentations on a loan application is a federal crime, a lesson those charged today have learned the hard way. Furthermore, bank insiders, of all people, should model the legal and ethical obligations of the financial institutions they serve, instead of breaking the law.”
According to the allegations contained in the Indictment [1] unsealed today in Manhattan federal court:
In or about 2009, ARON FRIED and a co-conspirator not named in the Indictment (“CC-1”) sought to obtain a fraudulent loan from the Bank in Manhattan in order to finance an investment in a home health care business.  However, knowing that CC-1 would not be credit-worthy and had a criminal record, FRIED and CC-1 used a straw borrower (the “Straw Borrower”) for the loan application who was recruited by CC-1.  To effectuate the scheme, FRIED and CC-1 partnered with MENDEL ZILBERBERG, then a director of the Bank, who had the power to personally shepherd the fraudulent loan through the Bank’s approval process and guard it from scrutiny.  Together, the defendants concocted a false premise for the loan, supported the loan application with false representations, and set up pass-through bank accounts to funnel the proceeds of the fraudulent loan to themselves.  Specifically, the defendants made or otherwise caused false statements to be made to the Bank regarding, among other things, (a) that the borrower on the loan was the Straw Borrower, when in fact the actual borrowers and beneficiaries of the loan were ZILBERBERG, FRIED, and CC-1; and (b) that the purpose of the loan was for business investments by the Straw Borrower, when in fact the actual purpose of the loan was to benefit ZILBERBERG, FRIED, and CC-1.
Based on the false representations made to the Bank and ZILBERBERG’s involvement in the loan approval process, the Bank issued a $1.4 million loan to the Straw Borrower, which was quickly disbursed to the defendants through multiple bank accounts and transfers.  In total, ZILBERBERG received at least approximately $466,000 of the loan proceeds, FRIED received at least approximately $434,000 of the loan proceeds, and CC-1 received the remainder of the loan proceeds.  The loan ultimately defaulted, resulting in a loss of over $1 million.
*                *                *
ZILBERBERG, 61 of Monsey, New York, and FRIED, 46 of Toms River, New Jersey, are each charged with one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud, one count of bank fraud, and one count of making false statements to a bank, each of which carries a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison, as well as one count of conspiracy to make false statements to a bank, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison.  ZILBERBERG is also charged with one count of embezzlement and misappropriation of bank funds, which carries a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison.  The maximum potential sentences are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendants will be determined by the judge.
Mr. Berman praised the investigative work of the FBI and the FDIC, Office of the Inspector General, and noted that the investigation remains ongoing.  Mr. Berman also thanked the Office of the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (“SIGTARP”) and the New York State Department of Financial Services for their assistance with the investigation.
The prosecution of this case is being handled by the Office’s Complex Frauds and Cybercrime Unit.  Assistant United States Attorneys Kimberly Ravener and Sagar K. Ravi are in charge of the prosecution.
The charges contained in the Indictment are merely accusations, and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.

Delhi Farmer Sentenced for Lying to Various Business and Government Entities to Steal Nearly $18 Million
MONROE, La. – A Delhi, Louisiana, farmer was sentenced today to 10 years in federal prison followed by three years of supervised release, for lying to more than seven financial institutions, insurance providers and government entities in an effort to obtain over $18 million illegally, announced United States Attorney David C. Joseph.
U.S. District Judge Terry A. Doughty also ordered Thomas A. Dickerson to pay $18,048,304.71 in restitution to the victims for the money he stole during the course of the scheme. Dickerson pled guilty on July 15, 2019.
According to court documents and information provided to the court, Dickerson was a Franklin Parish Louisiana farmer who, during the 2015 crop year, used at least 13 farming entities he was either a part of or was the sole owner of to certify farming acreage in Catahoula, Franklin, Tensas, Richland, Madison and Morehouse parishes in Louisiana, as well as Ashley, Chicot and Drew Counties in Arkansas. He applied for crop production and grain storage loans from AG Resource Management, farm operating loans from various FDIC insured banking entities, credit from seed and chemical dealers such as Greenpoint AG, LLC and Jimmy Sanders Seed, advances on contracts with Kennedy Rice Dryers, insurance policies and claims from Producers Agriculture Insurance Company and CGB Insurance Company, and several marketing assistance loans from the Commodity Credit Corporation.  Dickerson lied on many of these applications in order to obtain loans and other compensation by overstating or understating the amount of crops produced or claiming crops as collateral when he’d already sold the crops or didn’t possess them.
“The sentence imposed today should serve as a warning to those who engage in fraudulent practices and schemes,” U.S. Attorney Joseph stated. “Mr. Dickerson’s conduct in this case caused significant financial loss to victims throughout northeast Louisiana. This type of behavior will not be tolerated in the Western District of Louisiana.”
The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Office of Inspector General, investigated the case. U.S. Attorney David C. Joseph and Assistant U.S. Attorney Tiffany E. Fields prosecuted the case.

Outcome Health Agrees to Pay $70 Million to Resolve Fraud Investigation
ContextMedia Health LLC, which operates under the trade name Outcome Health (Outcome), a digital provider of medical information and advertising in doctors’ offices, has agreed to a resolution with the Department of Justice by which it will pay $70 million to victims of a fraud scheme that targeted its clients, lenders and investors.
Outcome, a privately held company headquartered in Chicago, Illinois, admitted in resolution documents that from 2012 to 2017, former executives and employees of the company perpetrated a scheme to defraud its clients—most of which were pharmaceutical companies—by selling advertising inventory that it did not have.
“Outcome Health deceived its lenders and investors, and overbilled its clients, by fraudulently misrepresenting both the quality and quantity of its advertising services and concealing those misrepresentations from auditors,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General John P. Cronan.  “Today’s resolution demonstrates the Criminal Division’s unyielding commitment to making whole victims of fraud.”
“Outcome’s payment of $70 million is an appropriate resolution for the corporate entity given the misconduct of executives and employees acting on its behalf,” said Assistant U.S. Attorney Brian Hayes, Chief of the Criminal Division for the Northern District of Illinois.  “This resolution demonstrates that there are significant consequences for businesses whose executives and employees engage in fraud.”
“For five years, employees of Outcome Health purposely failed to deliver on advertising campaigns and engaged in a pattern of misrepresentations to conceal their fraud,” said Special Agent in Charge Emmerson Buie Jr. of the FBI’s Chicago Field Office.  “This resolution demonstrates the FBI’s commitment to working with its prosecutorial and investigative partners to ensure that justice is done.”
“Today’s agreement holds a healthcare technology company accountable for systematically committing fraudulent business practices for financial gain over many years,” said Inspector General Jay N. Lerner of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s Office of Inspector General (FDIC-OIG).  “The FDIC-OIG is committed to investigating such corporate corruption which harms lending institutions, investors, customers, and competitors.  We remain dedicated to working with our law enforcement partners to investigate those who commit such misconduct.”
Outcome admitted that as a result of its practice of selling clients inventory it did not have, it under-delivered on its advertising campaigns.  Despite these under-deliveries, the company still invoiced its clients as if it had delivered in full.  To conceal the under-deliveries, Outcome employees at the time falsified affidavits and proofs of performance to make it appear the company was delivering advertising content to the number of screens in its clients’ contracts.  Outcome executives and employees during that time also inflated patient engagement metrics regarding how frequently patients engaged with Outcome’s devices.  Furthermore, an executive at the time altered a number of studies presented to clients to make it appear that the campaigns were more effective than they actually were, Outcome admitted.
Outcome further admitted that its under-delivery on advertising campaigns resulted in a material overstatement of its revenue for the years 2015 and 2016.  The company’s outside auditor signed off on the 2015 and 2016 revenue numbers because executives and employees at the time fabricated data to conceal the under-deliveries from the auditor.  Outcome used the inflated revenue figures in its 2015 and 2016 audited financial statements to raise $110 million in debt financing in April 2016, $375 million in debt financing in December 2016, and $487.5 million in equity financing in early 2017, it admitted.
The Department and Outcome entered into a non-prosecution agreement (NPA) to resolve this matter.  Outcome’s obligations under the agreement will have a term of three years, unless the term is modified by the government.  Under the terms of the NPA, Outcome and its current parent company, Outcome Health LLC (Outcome Parent), committed to compensating the pharmaceutical client victims in the amount of $70 million, approximately $65.5 million of which has already been made through a combination of cash payments and in-kind services, and to set aside an additional $4.5 million to compensate any additional pharmaceutical clients who have not yet been made whole.  The NPA does not require Outcome and Outcome Parent to provide compensation to lenders and investors who were victims of Outcome’s scheme, however, because many of those lenders and investors are now the companies’ new owners.  Under the terms of the NPA, Outcome and Outcome Parent also agreed to cooperate with the government’s ongoing investigation of individuals, to report evidence or allegations of U.S. federal law to the Department, and to enhance their existing compliance program and internal controls, where necessary and appropriate, to ensure they are designed to detect and deter violations of U.S. federal law.
The Department reached this resolution based on a number of factors, including Outcome and Outcome Parent’s ongoing cooperation with the United States and for taking extensive remedial measures.  For example, Outcome no longer employs the executives or employees who were involved in the wrongdoing, and Outcome and Outcome Parent made significant improvements to address and improve the reliability of reporting on advertising campaign delivery, including hiring third parties to audit all of their advertising campaigns.
The FBI and FDIC-OIG are investigating the case.  Assistant Chief William E. Johnston and Trial Attorney Kyle C. Hankey of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Matthew F. Madden of the Northern District of Illinois are prosecuting the case.

Two plead guilty to participation in a Ponzi scheme involving $2.5 billion in transactions and $1 billion in loss,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/two-plead-guilty-participation-ponzi-scheme-involving-25-billion,"October 22, 2019",2019,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Two plead guilty to participation in a Ponzi scheme involving $2.5 billion in transactions and $1 billion in loss
SACRAMENTO, Calif. — Two defendants pleaded guilty today to their participation in a massive fraud scheme involving a solar energy company in Benicia, that defrauded investors of approximately $1 billion, U.S. Attorney McGregor W. Scott announced. Those losses resulted from investment transactions in solar energy hardware valued at approximately $2.5 billion.
According to court documents, between 2011 and 2018, the solar energy company manufactured mobile solar generator units (MSG), solar generators that were mounted on trailers. The company touted the versatility and environmental sustainability of the MSGs and claimed that they were used by cellphone companies to provide emergency power to cell towers in the case of a power failure. They were also claimed to be used to power lights at sporting and other events.
The company solicited investors by claiming that there were very favorable federal tax benefits associated with investments in alternative energy. The company structured the transactions in order to maximize the tax benefits to the investors. Investors would buy the MSGs without ever taking possession of them. They would pay a percentage of the sales price and finance the balance with the company. Then the investors would lease the MSGs back to the company, which in turn leased them to third parties. A portion of the lease revenue would be used to pay the investors’ debts to the company and to the investors. The third‑party leases, however, generated little income and the company paid early investors with funds contributed by later investors.
According to court documents, Ronald J. Roach, 53, of Walnut Creek, a certified public accountant, provided accounting and tax services to the solar energy company. To trick investors, Roach prepared years of financial statements that falsely characterized investments to purchase MSGs as revenue earned from the rental of those MSGs. Roach and his co-conspirators used those fraudulent financial statements to hide from investors the company’s use of later investor payments to pay financial obligations the company made to earlier investors—in a classic, Ponzi-like scheme. Roach also pleaded guilty to securities violations associated with the same investment fraud scheme.
Joseph W. Bayliss, 44, of Martinez, a general contractor and electrician who provided services to the solar energy company, pleaded guilty to conspiring with Roach and others in connection with the same scheme to defraud investors. Bayliss admitted to preparing thousands of false reports certifying the existence and operating specifications of thousands of MSGs sold to investors. Bayliss admitted that, for at least two years, he signed many of those false reports knowing that the MSGs associated with them did not exist, and knowing investors would rely on those false reports. Bayliss also admitted that, at the direction of a co-conspirator, he flew to Las Vegas to destroy evidence after the execution of search warrants at the company’s headquarters and other locations in December 2018.
This case is the product of an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, IRS‑Criminal Investigation, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General. Assistant U.S. Attorneys André M. Espinosa and Kevin C. Khasigian are prosecuting the case.
The investigation is ongoing. Roach and Bayliss are schedule to be sentenced by U.S. District Judge John A. Mendez on Jan. 28, 2020. Roach faces a maximum statutory penalty of 10 years in prison. Bayliss faces a maximum statutory penalty of five years in prison. The actual sentences, however, will be determined at the discretion of the court after consideration of any applicable statutory factors and the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, which take into account a number of variables.

Former Bank Executive Pleads Guilty to Fraud Related to Failed Country Bank of Aledo, Illinois
ROCK ISLAND, Ill. – The former executive vice president and chief loan officer for the failed Country Bank of Aledo, Ill., Dana Frye, today pleaded guilty to charges of making false statements to the bank. During his appearance before Chief U.S. District Judge Sara Darrow, Frye pleaded guilty to conspiring with others to make materially false statements to the Country Bank board of directors to influence the bank to make loans to entities in which he held a personal financial interest.
Frye, 66, currently of Bettendorf, Iowa, served as executive vice president and chief lending officer for Country Bank, in Aledo, from its formation in March 2000 to Dec. 31, 2010. During that time, Frye held financial interest in multiple real estate developments. These developments included a golf course and surrounding residential lots in Sherrard, Ill., known as the “Fyre Lake Project,” which benefitted from Country Bank loans that totaled more than $20 million.
Frye admitted that he conspired with others to influence Country Bank to make loans to projects in which he held a personal financial interest, including the Fyre Lake Project, but failed to disclose his financial interest. Frye further admitted that he used his position to assist others to secure loans for the Fyre Lake Project and another project in Milan, Ill.
Frye held ownership in multiple companies that either directly participated in real estate development or provided services to persons and entities engaged in the development. One company, known as Webgem, Inc., owned by Frye and his son, provided accounting and other services to developers. Frye did not disclose to the bank board of directors that Webgem was going to be paid, and eventually was paid, $480,000, from bank loans of $5 million related to the project in Milan. In May 2009, Country Bank received $4.1 million in aid through the Department of Treasury’s Troubled Asset Relief Program, known as TARP. In October 2011, Country Bank failed and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, as receiver, covered losses in excess of $70 million.
At sentencing, scheduled on February 26, 2020, Frye faces a potential sentence of imprisonment of five years along with payment of restitution.
The FDIC Office of Inspector General and the Office of the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (SIGTARP) conducted the investigation. First Assistant U.S. Attorney Douglas Quivey and Assistant U.S. Attorney Douglas McMeyer represent the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Central District of Illinois in the case prosecution.

Bradley Chiropractor to Serve Nearly Three Years in Prison, Pay $495,000 Restitution for Insurance Billing Fraud, Failure to File Tax Returns
PEORIA, Ill. – U.S. District Judge James E. Shadid has ordered that Joseph Mayotte, who previously owned and operated Bradley Chiropractic Clinic, in Bradley, Ill., serve 33 months in prison, the sentence recommended by the government, and pay restitution in the amount of $401,000 to Blue Cross Blue Shield and $93,526 to the IRS. The hearing for Mayotte, 72, of Kankakee, Ill., concluded late afternoon on Oct. 3, before Judge Shadid in Peoria. Mayotte was ordered to report to the federal Bureau of Prisons on Dec. 17, 2019, to begin serving his sentence.
Mayotte entered pleas of guilty to the offenses charged on Feb. 11, 2019, as jury selection was beginning for trial. Mayotte admitted that from January 2007 to October 2015, he submitted false billing claims to defraud Blue Cross Blue Shield Insurance. The false claims were typically made on behalf of patients for whom the clinic had not provided any services or were in excess of the actual services provided. As a result, Blue Cross Blue Shield paid the clinic money to which it was not entitled, which Mayotte then used for his own benefit. In addition, Mayotte admitted that he failed to file federal income tax returns for tax years 2011 through 2014.
In addition to Mayotte, the clinic’s former office manager, Constance Leadingham, aka Connie, previously pleaded guilty to bank fraud and filing false income tax returns, and was sentenced on March 1, 2019. Leadingham, of Watseka, was sentenced to 12 months in federal prison for her role in the fraud scheme. As the clinic’s office manager, Leadingham admitted she submitted false billing claims, then wrote checks payable to herself from the clinic’s checking account in addition to her salary. Leadingham also admitted that in addition to the fraud scheme, she filed false income tax returns for tax years 2011, 2012, and 2013.
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Office of Inspector General; Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigations; and the Federal Bureau of Investigation conducted the investigation. Supervisory Assistant U.S. Attorney Eugene L. Miller and Assistant U.S. Attorney Timothy A. Bass represented the government in the case prosecutions.

Man Pleads Guilty to Embezzling Over $3 Million From Employer
ALEXANDRIA, Va. – A Maryland man pleaded guilty today to embezzling money from his employer, a Virginia business.
According to court documents, Reginald Zayas, 48, of Upper Marlboro, was the Controller at a Virginia-based company.  Over the course of almost four years, Zayas embezzled approximately $3.2 million from the company. Zayas embezzled the money by unlawfully transferring funds from the company’s bank account to his own bank account, and he then often transferred the money from his account to others. Zayas used the laundered money to pay for his own personal expenses.
Zayas pleaded guilty to violating the Travel Act and faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison when sentenced on Jan. 31, 2020. Actual sentences for federal crimes are typically less than the maximum penalties. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after taking into account the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.
G. Zachary Terwilliger, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, Timothy M. Dunham, Special Agent in Charge, Criminal Division, FBI Washington Field Office, and Jay N. Lerner, Inspector General of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC-OIG), made the announcement after Senior U.S. District Judge Claude M. Hilton accepted the plea. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Cristina Stam and William Fitzpatrick are prosecuting the case.

Second Employee In Cash Flow Partners Bank Fraud Conspiracy Charged In Multimillion-Dollar Loan Scheme
NEWARK, N.J. – A Bergen County, New Jersey, woman has been charged for her role in a conspiracy that involved the creation of false documentation to secure over $4 million dollars in bank loans, U.S. Attorney Craig Carpenito announced.
Jennie Frias, a/k/a “Jennie Castillo,” 36, of Englewood, New Jersey, was charged by complaint with one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud. Frias had her initial appearance Sept. 25, 2019, before U.S. Magistrate Judge James B. Clark III in Newark federal court and was released on a $100,000 unsecured bond.
According to documents filed in this case and statements made in court:
Between March 2016 and May 2018, Cash Flow Partners LLC, a business consulting firm with offices in New York and New Jersey, released internet advertisements and held seminars offering to assist customers in obtaining bank loans, including loans insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). When customers submitted documentation supporting their bank loan applications to Cash Flow Partners, Frias and others created false documentation to make customers’ loan applications appear more financially viable than they actually were. Employees in Cash Flow’s “File Building Department” falsified payroll records by including fictitious financial and employment information, such as fake jobs, on template payroll forms and IRS tax forms. Then, employees in Cash Flow’s “Funding Department,” of which Frias became director, took steps to pose as the loan applicants when communicating with the victim banks. For example, Funding Department employees remotely controlled computers located at the homes of the loan applicants to submit documents to the banks. Funding Department employees also took possession of the loan applicants’ cell phones and communicated with the banks posing as the loan applicants. The victim banks sustained losses of over $4 million.
One of Frias’ conspirators, Raymundo Torres, pleaded guilty Sept. 24, 2019 , to charges relating to his role in the Cash Flow bank fraud conspiracy.
The conspiracy to commit bank fraud charge carries a maximum potential penalty of 30 years in prison and a $1 million fine.
Individuals who believe they may have information about this case may contact the FBI at 1-800-CALL-FBI (225-5324).
U.S. Attorney Carpenito credited special agents of the FDIC-Office of the Inspector General (FDIC-OIG), under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Patricia Tarasca in New York, and special agents of the FBI, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Gregory W. Ehrie in Newark, with the investigation leading to the charges.
The government is represented by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Ari B. Fontecchio of the Economic Crimes Unit and J. Stephen Ferketic of the U.S. Attorney’s Office Opioids Unit in Newark.
The charge and allegations against Frias are merely accusations, and she is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.

Raleigh County Woman Indicted on Multiple Counts of Wire Fraud, Bank Fraud, Bankruptcy Fraud and Money Laundering
BECKLEY, W.Va. – A federal grand jury returned an indictment yesterday charging a Beckley woman with multiple counts of fraud, announced United States Attorney Mike Stuart.   Natalie P. Cochran, 38, owner of Technology Management Solutions (TMS) and Tactical Solutions Group (TSG), was charged in a 26-count indictment with wire fraud, bank fraud, money laundering, aggravated identity theft and bankruptcy fraud.
“A 26-count indictment alleging wire fraud, bank fraud, money laundering, aggravated identity theft and bankruptcy fraud,” said United States Attorney Mike Stuart.  “All indictments are serious and this is a serious matter. Ms. Cochran pretended to be a government contractor, intentionally misled investors to raise money for her fraudulent schemes, intentionally stole personal identification information from multiple individuals, falsely marketed herself and her companies as experienced, leading suppliers of government services while never being awarded a single federal contract and having two potential state contracts cancelled, and then engaged in bankruptcy fraud.  I want to thank the work of my team and the West Virginia State Police, Secret Service, FDIC and ATF for their tremendous work in this matter.”
“The results of this investigation demonstrate the Secret Service’s commitment to strong partnerships between local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies,” said Thomas Fleming, Resident Agent in Charge of the U.S. Secret Service Charleston Resident Office.  “We are committed to protecting our nation’s financial institutions and the citizens of West Virginia.  We would like to thank the West Virginia State Police, the ATF, and the FDIC OIG for their cooperation and partnership in this case.”
According to the indictment, Cochran has pretended to be an experienced government contractor since 2017.  She advertised TMS and TSG as experienced government contracting businesses.   TSG’s website even boasted that it was a leading supplier to the Department of Defense.  Investigators learned however, that TSG was never awarded a single federal or state government contract.  TMS was awarded two state government contracts, but the State of West Virginia ultimately cancelled these awards because of TMS’ repeated delays in performance.
It is further alleged in the indictment that Cochran received investments from at least 11 individuals in her government contracting businesses, TSG and TMS.  Cochran received these investments as a result of her false misrepresentations regarding TSG’s and TMS’ experience and purported success as government contractors.  Cochran also received funds from at least one financial institution as a result of her false and misleading statements regarding TSG and TMS.  During the course of her fraudulent schemes, Cochran stole identification information from multiple individuals, who were either employed by the federal government or the banking industry.  She would then send investors emails that were purportedly from these individuals in order to further her wire fraud and bank fraud schemes.
This past July, Cochran filed for bankruptcy.  The indictment further alleges that she made several material misrepresentations within her bankruptcy filing and lied while testifying under oath at her meeting of creditors.
The indictment alleges that Cochran fraudulently obtained over $2.5 million during her scheme and is believed to have spent over $1 million of investor money.  Cochran used investor money to fund her lifestyle for over a year and a half, as she was unemployed during that time outside of her work with TSG and TMS. She also used the investor money for extravagant purchases, including jewelry, a 1965 Shelby Cobra, and multiple properties.
If convicted, the defendant faces a maximum penalty of 30 years in prison.
The West Virginia State Police, the United States Secret Service, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) conducted the investigation.   Assistant United States Attorney Kathleen Robeson is handling the prosecution.
Please note:  An indictment contains allegations that a defendant has committed a crime. Every defendant is presumed to be innocent until and unless proven guilty in court.

Former Bank Employee in Austin Sentenced to Federal Prison for Stealing over One Million Dollars from Customer,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/former-bank-employee-austin-sentenced-federal-prison-stealing,"September 19, 2019",2019,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Former Bank Employee in Austin Sentenced to Federal Prison for Stealing over One Million Dollars from Customer
In Austin today, a federal judge sentenced 40–year-old former Austin Capital One bank employee Paola Gallego of Round Rock, TX, to five years in federal prison for stealing over $1 million from a bank customer, announced U.S. Attorney John F. Bash, FBI Special Agent in Charge Christopher Combs, San Antonio Division, and Special Agent in Charge Laurie L. Younger, FDIC Office of Inspector General (FDIC OIG), Dallas Region.
In addition to the prison term, U.S. District Judge Robert Pitman ordered Gallego to pay a monetary judgment forfeiture in the amount of $1.2 Million; pay $1,403,979.13 in restitution to Capital One Bank (which had reimbursed the victims for their losses); and, be placed on supervised release for a period of four years after completing her prison term.  Gallego remains on a $1 million bond pending Bureau of Prisons notification as to when and where to report to begin her prison sentence.
On May 9, 2019, Gallego pleaded guilty to one count of bank fraud and agreed to liquidate and remit certain assets and properties to be applied towards restitution.
Court records and testimony show that beginning in April 2014, Gallego began servicing the Capital One accounts of an elderly Austin couple.  Gallego told one of her victims that if the spouse should die, another family member could take control of the money in their bank account—approximately $4.4 million. In September 2016, the victim took $400,000 and opened up an account at Wells Fargo Bank with Gallego’s assistance.  Over the next two weeks, Gallego spent $94,779.13 on personal and family expenditures including a $50,000 wire transfer to Bancolombia on September 28, 2016, and a $20,586.81 online credit card payment to Chase Bank to an account in the name of her mother.  Wells Fargo closed that account on suspicions of elder abuse.
Gallego and her victim subsequently opened another joint checking account, this time at J.P. Morgan Chase (Chase Bank).  Gallego told a Chase Bank employee that she was her victim’s caretaker and a stay-at-home mother, which was false.  Gallego then opened up a separate individual bank account at Chase Bank.  Between October 14, 2016 and April 20, 2017, Gallego’s victim withdrew $1.2 million from the joint Capital One account via cashier’s checks with the understanding that Gallego would deposit those funds into their joint account at Chase Bank for investment purposes.  Instead, Gallego deposited those checks into her own Chase Bank account and used the money for personal expenses, including purchasing a Range Rover Sport HSE, shopping, a Hawaiian vacation, making home improvements including a pool, making mortgage payments, paying off family member’s credit card balances, and purchasing a VW Passat for her parents.
“Stealing money by defrauding the elderly is reprehensible.  We will continue to smoke out wrongdoers in our community who take advantage of the most vulnerable citizens,” stated U.S. Attorney Bash.
“This is a clear cut case of an individual taking full advantage of vulnerable victims for financial gain,” stated FBI Special Agent in Charge Combs.  “We will continue our vigorous pursuit of those who commit such unscrupulous actions with little or no regard for their victims.”
“The FDIC OIG, along with its law enforcement partners, is dedicated to pursuing those who commit schemes to defraud the nation’s federally insured financial institutions and its customers,” stated FDIC OIG Special Agent in Charge Younger.
Agents with the FBI, including an FBI Task Force officer from the Texas Department of Public Safety, and the FDIC OIG investigated this case.  Assistant U.S. Attorneys Michael Galdo and Neeraj Gupta prosecuted this case on behalf of the Government.

Tupelo Loan Officer Sentenced for Bank Fraud
OXFORD, Miss. – A Tupelo bank officer and his co-defendant were sentenced today by U.S. District Judge Debra M. Brown in federal court in Greenville, Mississippi for bank fraud.  Both had previously pled guilty before Judge Brown to one count of Bank Fraud, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1344.  Judge Brown sentenced Max Miller, age 53, to serve 18 months imprisonment followed by two years of supervised release.  James Nichols, age, 52, was sentenced to time served followed by 5 years of supervised release.  Judge Brown ordered both Miller and Nichols to pay $374,261 in restitution to Renasant Bank.
Max Miller, without the knowledge of Renasant Bank, used his position as a loan officer at Renasant Bank to create loans in the name of specified borrowers when the loans were not actually intended for the named borrowers but were actually intended to benefit his co-defendant, James Nichols, who was not listed as the borrower on the loans.  In addition to the scheme with Nichols, Miller also generated loans for his own benefit.  As a result of this scheme, Renasant Bank suffered a financial loss of $374,261.
US Attorney Chad Lamar announced the sentences following Friday’s hearing and emphasized the importance of the case.  “The United States Attorney’s Office is committed to holding accountable any individuals who violate federal law by defrauding the very financial institutions that employ them.” Lamar stated. “The actions of these individuals represent a betrayal not only of the bank they defrauded, but the public trust, and we appreciate the diligent investigation by our partners that helped bring these individuals to justice.”
""The FDIC OIG remains focused in our efforts to investigate financial fraud schemes impacting FDIC-insured financial institutions throughout the country."" remarked Laurie Younger, Special Agent in Charge, FDIC-OIG, Dallas Field Office
“The Federal Housing Finance Agency Office of Inspector General (FHFA-OIG) is committed to investigating allegations of fraud committed by officers of financial institutions which are members of the 11 Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBanks) because their crimes strike at the heart of the FHLBank System,” said Edwin Bonano, Special Agent in Charge of the FHFA-OIG’s Southeast Region Office. “We are proud to have partnered with the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Mississippi in this case.”
This case was investigated by the FDIC Office of Inspector General and the Federal Housing Finance Agency Office of Inspector General and prosecuted by AUSA Clay Dabbs.

Treyton Thomas Sentenced to 262 Months' Imprisonment for Multi-Million Dollar Investment Fraud Scheme and Income Tax Evasion
RALEIGH – Robert J. Higdon, Jr., United States Attorney for the Eastern District of North Carolina, announces that today, United States District Judge James C. Dever III sentenced TREYTON LEE THOMAS, age 63, to 262 months’   imprisonment for wire fraud and 60 months’ imprisonment for income tax evasion, to run concurrently.  Judge Dever also ordered THOMAS to pay approximately $7.3 million in restitution to the victims of the investment and bank fraud schemes, the Internal Revenue Service and the United States Attorney’s Office and to forfeit an additional $7.3 million to the United States.
On November 22, 2016, THOMAS was charged in a 21-Count Indictment with wire fraud, bank fraud and money laundering.  This Indictment charged THOMAS, who represented himself as a successful Harvard educated investment advisor, with defrauding his father’s used car warranty company, NC&VA Warranty of Roxboro, N.C., several of its customers, his wife, and his father-in-law.  THOMAS claimed he was conservatively investing their money in U.S. Treasury Bills.  Instead, through an on-line brokerage firm, THOMAS used these funds to conduct risky trades in the commodities and futures market.  To conceal this fraud scheme, THOMAS provided these victims and various financial institutions with false information and fabricated bank and brokerage statements.  To obtain additional funds, the Indictment charged THOMAS with using the same false information and fabricated statements to defraud financial institutions out of approximately 1.9 million dollars in loan proceeds.   In addition to losing the victims’ money in risky trades, the Indictment charged THOMAS with spending more than 1.6 million dollars to pay personal expenses.
On March 15, 2018, THOMAS was charged in another Indictment with six counts of income tax evasion for the calendar years 2010 through 2015 and two counts of failing to disclose his interest in and authority over foreign bank accounts.  According to court records, THOMAS failed to file United States Income Tax Returns (Forms 1040) or pay taxes for two decades.  To conceal his income, THOMAS used offshore entities, in the Cayman Islands, the British Virgin Islands and Nevis, and employed individuals from offshore corporation management companies to act as his nominee in numerous business ventures.  These foreigners opened and managed bank accounts through which THOMAS moved the victims’ funds in and out of the United States.  Additionally, THOMAS created fake or “ghost” employees to make it appear that he operated a large, successful investment fund.   To conceal his own identity, THOMAS used aliases or variations of his given name.
The Court agreed with the Government that THOMAS had attempted to obstruct justice and was not entitled to a reduced sentence for acceptance of responsibility even though he pled guilty.  Several victims spoke at the sentencing hearing, describing the financial and emotional toll THOMAS’ crimes had caused.
Investigation of this case was conducted by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation-Office of the Inspector General, the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigations, and the United States Secret Service.  Assistant United States Attorneys Susan Menzer and John Harris represented the government in this case.

Former Bank Executive Found Guilty in $15 Million Construction Loan Fraud Scheme
A former Kansas bank executive was found guilty by a federal jury yesterday for his participation in a bank fraud scheme to obtain a $15 million construction loan for certain bank customers based upon false and fraudulent representations.  The loan was shared among 26 Kansas banks.
Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, Special Agent in Charge Justin R. Bundy of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General’s (FDIC-OIG) Kansas City Regional Office, Special Agent in Charge Timothy R. Langan of the FBI’s Kansas City Field Office and Special Agent in Charge Catherine Huber of the Federal Housing Finance Agency Office of Inspector General’s (FHFA-OIG) Central Region Office made the announcement.
Troy A. Gregory, 52, of Lawrence, Kansas, was found guilty of four counts of bank fraud and two counts of false statements, as charged in a November 2017 indictment.  The jury failed to reach a verdict as to one count of conspiracy.  Sentencing is scheduled for Jan. 28, 2020, before U.S. District Judge Carlos Murguia of the District of Kansas, who presided over the trial.
According to the evidence submitted at trial, Gregory was a bank executive and loan officer who had made millions of dollars in loans to a group of borrowers who were struggling to make payments on the loans.  Beginning in approximately late 2007, Gregory began the process of making a $15.2 million construction loan to build an apartment complex to that same group of borrowers.  Gregory’s bank shared this loan with 25 other Kansas banks.  Gregory made and caused others to make false statements to the banks about the strength of the borrowers, the debt status of the apartment property and the existence of approximately $1.7 million in certificates of deposit for collateral on the loan, all to get the loan approved.  Instead of using the loan funds promised for building the apartments, Gregory immediately diverted over $1 million of the loan to pay for part of the certificates of deposit pledged as collateral, pay off debt on the apartment property, and make payments on unrelated loans, the evidence showed.  Other Kansas banks that shared in this loan would not have participated in the loan without the false representations and promises. The banks ultimately wrote off millions of dollars on the $15.2 million construction loan, the evidence showed.
The FDIC-OIG, IRS-CI, FBI and FHFA-OIG are investigating this matter.  Trial Attorney Andrew R. Tyler and Senior Litigation Counsel David A. Bybee of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section are prosecuting the case.

New Orleans Business Owner Pleads Guilty to Conspiracy to Defraud First NBC Bank,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/new-orleans-business-owner-pleads-guilty-conspiracy-defraud,"July 30, 2019",2019,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

New Orleans Business Owner Pleads Guilty to Conspiracy to Defraud First NBC Bank
NEW ORLEANS – The United States Attorney’s Office announced that KENNETH CHARITY (“CHARITY”), age 54, a resident of New Orleans, Louisiana, pleaded guilty today to conspiring to defraud First NBC Bank, the New Orleans-based bank that failed in April 2017.
According to the Bill of Information, from in or around February 2007 through April 2017, CHARITY had a banking relationship with First NBC Bank, individually and through certain entities. During that time, Bank President A acted as the loan officer for CHARITY and the loan officer to certain of CHARITY’s entities (“the Entities”). By the time First NBC Bank failed, the balances on the loans issued to CHARITY and the entities totaled more than $18 million. CHARITY, Bank President A, and others knowingly conspired to defraud First NBC Bank. According to the Bill of Information, the purpose of the conspiracy was for CHARITY, Bank President A, and others to unjustly enrich themselves, disguise the true financial status of CHARITY and the Entities, conceal the accurate performance, and misrepresented the purpose of the loans made to KENNETH CHARITY and the Entities.
KENNETH CHARITY, Bank President A, and others provided First NBC Bank with materially false and fraudulent documents and financial statements, which, among other things, overstated the value of KENNETH CHARITY’s assets, understated his liabilities, and omitted material information. These false statements disguised his and the Entities’ true financial condition.
The Bill of Information also alleges that it was part of the conspiracy for Bank President A and others to disguise CHARITY and the Entities’ true financial condition by, among other things, issuing new loans to CHARITY and the Entities, which would pay older loans that CHARITY was unable to repay. The new loans would then appear to be current and performing, while the old loans appeared to have been paid. In reality, CHARITY had insufficient income and cash flow to support his debt at First NBC Bank. Bank President A was well-aware that CHARITY was unable to repay his loans, yet Bank President A continued to falsely represent in bank records that CHARITY and his Entities were profitable.
Additionally, the Bill of Information alleges CHARITY, Bank President A, and others, carried out the conspiracy by repeatedly lying in bank loan documents about the purpose of loans that Bank President A approved for CHARITY and the Entities. Specifically, Bank President A approved loans for CHARITY and his Entities that appeared to be for legitimate business purposes. In reality, CHARITY spent loan proceeds on personal expenses. Bank President A was aware that CHARITY did not spend the loan proceeds consistently with the purposes stated on the loan documents. For example, from in or around August 2014 through in or around December 2016, Bank President A caused three loans to be disbursed to one of CHARITY’s entities for the purpose, in part, of enclosing a patio at a beignet shop located at 620 Decatur Street. CHARITY never built the patio. The loan proceeds were used instead to pay CHARITY’s overdrafts, which included personal expenses, and to make loan payments.
CHARITY could face up to 30 years’ imprisonment, a fine of not more than $1 million, or twice the gross gain to him or the gross loss of any victims, 5 years of supervised release, and a special assessment of $100.
Judge Lance M. Africk set CHARITY’s sentencing hearing for October 23, 2019 at 2 pm.
This case is being investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation; the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of Inspector General; and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Office of Inspector General. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Sharan E. Lieberman, Matthew R. Payne, Nicholas D. Moses, and J. Ryan McLaren are in charge of the prosecution.

Vallejo Man Sentenced to 4 Years in Prison for Multimillion Dollar Mortgage and Foreclosure Rescue Fraud Scheme
SACRAMENTO, Calif. — U.S. District Judge Garland E. Burrell Jr. sentenced Zalathiel Aguila, 46, of Vallejo, to four years in prison for conspiracy to commit wire fraud affecting a financial institution and bank fraud, U.S. Attorney McGregor W. Scott announced.
According to court documents, between September 2004 and February 2008, Aguila and co-conspirators Sergio Roman Barrientos and Omar Anabo operated Capital Access LLC, in Vallejo, a company that preyed on homeowners nearing foreclosure. The defendants convinced homeowners to sign over the title to their homes to Capital Access and then spent any equity those homeowners still had, which was then used for operational expenses of the scheme and personal expenses of Aguila and his co-conspirators.
The defendants also used straw buyers to obtain home loans under false pretenses and defraud federally insured financial institutions out of millions of dollars. Vulnerable homeowners across California lost their homes and savings as a result of the scheme, and lenders lost an estimated $10.47 million from the fraud.
This case was the product of an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the United States Postal Inspection Service. Assistant U.S. Attorney Matthew M. Yelovich prosecuted the case.
Aguila remains out of custody pending his surrendering for service of his sentence on Oct. 25. Barrientos was sentenced on Nov. 2, 2018, to 14 years in prison for his role in the scheme, and Anabo (charged elsewhere) is scheduled to be sentenced on Aug. 16.

Minnesota Couple Pleads Guilty for Long-Running Fraud Scheme
Real Estate Company Pleads Guilty to Fraud Conspiracy
Detloff Marketing and Asset Management Inc. (Detloff Marketing), a real estate company based in Hopkins, Minnesota; its owner, Jeffery J. Detloff; and its accountant, Lori K. Detloff, pleaded guilty today in the U.S. District Court in St. Paul, Minnesota, for their participation in a long-running fraudulent bidding and kickback scheme in connection with foreclosed properties, the Department of Justice announced today.
According to court documents, from September 2007 and continuing until June 2015, Jeffery Detloff, of Minnetonka, Minnesota, conspired to defraud mortgage lenders and guarantors who had hired Detloff, a realtor, to oversee maintenance and repairs on foreclosed homes in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area.  Jeffery Detloff steered maintenance and repair contracts to contractors who would pay a kickback to Detloff Marketing.  Unbeknownst to his customers, Jeffery Detloff and Detloff Marketing included the kickbacks within bids and invoices sent to the lender or guarantor for reimbursement on maintenance and repairs.  Lori Detloff, also of Minnetonka, Minnesota, was an accountant responsible for ensuring the kickbacks were paid by contractors to Detloff Marketing.  In all, Detloff Marketing received over $291,505 in kickbacks.
“For years, the defendants orchestrated and executed a scheme that allowed them to reap illicit profits from homes in foreclosure,” said Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim of the Department of Justice’s Antitrust Division.  “These plea agreements demonstrate the Justice Department’s continued commitment, and that of our law enforcement partners, to protect victims, including Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, from those who subvert competition using false, fraudulent, and sham bids.”
“In this case, the Detloffs abused their power and position with self-serving behavior that essentially increased mortgage costs to customers of the victim lenders,” said Jill Sanborn, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI's Minneapolis Division.  “The FBI works hand in hand with federal prosecutors to root out this type of fraud and hopes this case has a chilling effect on others who may have designs on similar behavior when put in positions of trust by lenders.”
Detloff Marketing and Jeffery Detloff pleaded guilty to Count 1 of the Indictment, which charged a conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud affecting a financial institution.  Lori Detloff pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting the principal offense described in Count 4 of the indictment, mail fraud affecting a financial institution.  As part of their plea agreements, the Antitrust Division agreed to move to dismiss the remaining counts against Detloff Marketing, Jeffery Detloff, and Lori Detloff upon sentencing.
This is the second case involving fraud and kickbacks relating to maintenance and repair contracts for foreclosed properties in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area.  The conspiracy and fraud charges carry a maximum penalty of 30 years in prison and a fine of $1,000,000.  The maximum fine may be increased to twice the gain derived from the crime or twice the loss suffered by the victims of the crime, if either of those amounts is greater than the statutory maximum fine.
In addition to their guilty pleas, the defendants agreed to pay restitution in the amount of $291,505.  The terms of the plea agreements are subject to the approval of the Court.
The plea agreements announced today are the result of a federal investigation of housing repair contracts in the Minneapolis area.  The investigation is being conducted by the Antitrust Division’s Chicago Office and the FBI’s Minneapolis Division.  Anyone with information on customer allocation, bid rigging, price fixing, or other anticompetitive conduct related to the real estate industry in Minnesota should contact the Antitrust Division’s Chicago Office at 312-984-7200.

Delhi farmer pleads guilty to lying to various business and government entities to steal nearly $17 million
MONROE, La. – A Delhi, Louisiana, farmer pleaded guilty Monday to lying to more than seven financial institutions, insurance providers and government entities in an effort to obtain nearly $17 million illegally, U.S. Attorney David C. Joseph announced. Thomas Dickerson, 45, pleaded guilty before U.S. District Judge Terry Doughty for making false statements to the Commodity Credit Corporation.
According to the guilty plea, Dickerson was a Franklin Parish Louisiana farmer who, during the 2015 crop year, used at least 13 farming entities he was either a part of or was the sole owner of to certify farming acreage in Catahoula, Franklin, Tensas, Richland, Madison and Morehouse parishes in Louisiana, as well as Ashley, Chicot and Drew Counties in Arkansas.  He applied for crop production and grain storage loans from AG Resource Management, farm operating loans from various FDIC insured banking entities, credit from seed and chemical dealers such as Greenpoint AG LLC and Jimmy Sanders Seed, advances on contracts with Kennedy Rice Dryers, insurance policies and claims from Producers Agriculture Insurance Company and CGB Insurance Company, and several marketing assistance loans from the Commodity Credit Corporation.  Dickerson lied on many of these applications in order to obtain loans and other compensation by overstating or understating the amount of crops produced or claiming crops as collateral when he’d already sold the crops or didn’t possess them.  He stole $16,985,409.71 during the course of the scheme.
“This case should serve as a warning to those who engage in crooked financial schemes,” Joseph stated.  “The Department of Justice is committed to protecting taxpayer money set aside to help our farmers and prosecuting those who cheat financial institutions and insurance companies for personal gain.  The defendant’s conduct in this case not only caused significant financial loss to victims throughout northeast Louisiana, but also undermined the integrity of our agricultural finance system.  This type of behavior will not be tolerated in the Western District of Louisiana.”
Dickerson faces up to 10 years in prison, three years of supervised release, restitution and a $10,000 fine. S entencing is scheduled for November 6, 2019.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Office of Inspector General, investigated the case.  United States Attorney David C. Joseph and Assistant U.S. Attorney Tiffany E. Fields are prosecuting the case.

South Florida Resident Sentenced to 30 Years for $100 Million International Fraud Scheme that Led to the Collapse of One of Puerto Rico’s Largest Banks
A Key Biscayne, Florida, resident and the former CEO and Chairman of a now-bankrupt multinational pharmaceutical company was sentenced to 30 years in prison followed by five years of supervised release yesterday for his role his role in a $100 million scheme to defraud Westernbank of Puerto Rico (Westernbank). The losses triggered a series of events leading to Westernbank’s insolvency and ultimate collapse.
Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Ariana Fajardo Orshan of the Southern District of Florida, Inspector General Jay N. Lerner of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC-OIG), Special Agent in Charge Michael J. DePalma of IRS Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI) for Miami and Puerto Rico, Special Agent in Charge Iván J. Arvelo of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) in San Juan and Special Agent in Charge Douglas A. Leff of the FBI’s San Juan, Puerto Rico Field Office made the announcement.
Jack Kachkar, 56, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Donald L. Graham of the Southern District of Florida, who also presided over the trial in this case.  Judge Graham also ordered the defendant to pay $103,490,005 in restitution to the FDIC, as receiver for Westernbank.  Kachkar was convicted on Feb. 4, 2019, after a three-week trial, of eight counts of wire fraud affecting a financial institution.
According to evidence presented at trial, from 2005 to 2007, Kachkar served as chairman and CEO of Inyx Inc., a publicly traded multinational pharmaceutical manufacturing company.  Beginning in early 2005, Kachkar caused Westernbank to enter into a series of loan agreements in exchange for a security interest in the assets of Inyx and its subsidiaries.  Under the loan agreements, Westernbank agreed to advance money based on Inyx’s customer invoices from “actual and bona fide” sales to Inyx customers, the evidence showed.
The trial evidence showed that Kachkar orchestrated a scheme to defraud Westernbank by causing numerous Inyx employees to make tens of millions of dollars worth of fake customer invoices purportedly payable by customers in the United Kingdom, Sweden and elsewhere.  Kachkar caused these invoices to be presented to Westernbank as valid invoices.  Kachkar made false and fraudulent representations to Westernbank executives about purported and imminent repayments from lenders in the United Kingdom, Norway, Libya and elsewhere in order to lull Westernbank into continuing to lend money to Inyx, the evidence showed.  In fact, these lenders had not agreed to repay Westernbank’s loan.  Kachkar made false and fraudulent representations to Westernbank executives that he had additional collateral, including purported mines in Mexico and Canada worth hundreds of millions of dollars, to induce Westernbank to lend additional funds, the evidence showed.  In fact, this additional collateral was worth barely a fraction of that represented by Kachkar.
During the course of the scheme, Kachkar caused Westernbank to lend approximately $142 million, primarily based on false and fraudulent customer invoices.  The evidence showed that the defendant diverted tens of millions of dollars for his own personal benefit, including for the purchase of, among other things, a private jet, luxury homes in Key Biscayne and Brickell, Miami, luxury cars, luxury hotel stays, and extravagant jewelry and clothing expenditures.
In or around June 2007, Westernbank declared the loan in default and ultimately suffered losses exceeding $100 million on the Inyx loans.  According to trial evidence, these losses later triggered a series of events leading to Westernbank’s insolvency and ultimate collapse.  At the time of its collapse, Westernbank had approximately 1,500 employees and was one of the largest banks in Puerto Rico.
This case was investigated by the FDIC-OIG, IRS-CI, HSI and FBI.  The Department of Justice’s Office of International Affairs provided significant support in the investigation.  The case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael N. Berger of the Southern District of Florida and Trial Attorney Michael O’Neill of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section.  The Department acknowledges and appreciates the substantial assistance of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the U.K. Metropolitan Police.

Bank General Counsel Pleads Guilty To Conspiracy to Defraud First NBC Bank,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/bank-general-counsel-pleads-guilty-conspiracy-defraud-first-nbc,"July 2, 2019",2019,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Bank General Counsel Pleads Guilty To Conspiracy to Defraud First NBC Bank
NEW ORLEANS – The United States Attorney’s Office announced that GREGORY ST. ANGELO (“ST. ANGELO”), age 54, a resident of St. Tammany Parish, pled guilty Friday, June 28, 2019 to conspiring to defraud First NBC Bank, the New Orleans-based bank that failed in April of 2017.
According to court documents, from in or around 2006 through the fall of 2016, ST. ANGELO was the general counsel of First NBC Bank. During this time, he and several businesses owned or controlled by him (the “Entities”) were First NBC Bank borrowers. Bank President A was a founder of First NBC Bank and acted as its president and Chief Executive Officer from in or around May 2006, until in or around December 2016. From in or around 2006 through April 2017, Bank Officer B was employed by First NBC Bank as its Chief Credit Officer, and was responsible for, among other things, the overall quality of the bank’s lending function.
Beginning at a time unknown, but at least in or around 2006, through in and around April 2017, in the Eastern District of Louisiana and elsewhere, the defendant, ST. ANGELO, and others known and unknown, conspired to defraud First NBC Bank by means of false and fraudulent pretenses, representations, and promises, relating to a material fact.
The purpose of the conspiracy was for the defendant, ST. ANGELO, Bank President A, Bank Officer B, and others to enrich themselves unjustly by disguising the true financial status of ST. ANGELO, the Entities, and other borrowers, concealing the accurate performance of loans, and misrepresenting the nature of payments to ST. ANGELO and certain Entities.
ST. ANGELO, Bank President A, Bank Officer B, and others sought to accomplish the conspiracy by engaging in the below activities:
ST. ANGELO, Bank President A, Bank Officer B, and others provided First NBC Bank with materially false and fraudulent documents and personal financial statements, which, among other things, overstated the value of ST. ANGELO’s and the Entities’ assets, understated their liabilities, and omitted material information. The materially false and fraudulent personal financial statements, collateral summaries, and other documents concealed ST. ANGELO’s and the Entities’ true financial condition.
Bank President A, Bank Officer B, and others disguised ST. ANGELO’s and the Entities’ true financial condition by, among other things, issuing new loans to ST. ANGELO and certain Entities to pay older loans that ST. ANGELO was unable to repay and to cover his overdrafts. The new loans then appeared to be current, while the old loans and overdrafts appeared to have been paid. In reality, the new loans were designed to avert the downgrading or impairment of ST. ANGELO’s and several Entities’ loans and to avoid reporting them as nonperforming or losses to the bank.
Another means the conspirators used to disguise ST. ANGELO’s and the Entities’ true financial condition was to extend the maturity date of older loans on which ST. ANGELO was unable to make payments, which allowed First NBC Bank to avoid downgrading, impairing, or reporting the loans as nonperforming or losses to the bank.
Bank President A, Bank Officer B, and others funded fraudulent tax credit investments that First NBC Bank purportedly made in certain Entities owned by ST. ANGELO. In reality, the supposed investments simply funneled money from First NBC Bank’s general ledger to ST. ANGELO and certain Entities, so that ST. ANGELO could make his loan payments and cure overdrafts, and so the bank could avoid downgrading, impairing, or reporting the loans as nonperforming or losses to the bank.
On multiple occasions, Bank President A and ST. ANGELO executed false documents entitled “Agreements to Purchase Tax Credits” designed to make it appear that First NBC Bank was paying ST. ANGELO and certain Entities money in exchange for ownership interests in entities supposedly owned by ST. ANGELO. In reality, these agreements were a way for Bank President A, Bank Officer B, and ST. ANGELO to justify the diversion of bank funds to ST. ANGELO and certain Entities to cure overdrafts and avoid reporting requirements. On multiple occasions, Bank Officer B directed the disbursement of payments to ST. ANGELO and certain Entities from First NBC Bank’s general ledger, purportedly for tax credit investments, knowing that the tax credit investments were false.
Yet another means by which Bank President A, ST. ANGELO, Bank Officer B, and others concealed the true financial condition of ST. ANGELO’s and certain Entities’ loans was to lend funds to ST. ANGELO’s associates as nominees. Bank President A and ST. ANGELO caused the nominees to sign loan documents, making it appear that the nominee entity was taking out the loan solely for its own use. In fact, the loan proceeds often were paid to ST. ANGELO or certain Entities, not the nominees, and were, in part, used to pay ST. ANGELO’s and the Entities’ existing debts to First NBC Bank or to enrich ST. ANGELO and certain Entities.
ST. ANGELO, Bank President A, and Bank Officer B caused employees of First NBC Bank to transfer the nominee loan proceeds directly to ST. ANGELO’s or the Entities’ deposit accounts, when ST. ANGELO, Bank President A, and Bank Officer B knew the loans were not solely for the nominee, but benefitted ST. ANGELO, who was not named in the loan documents or listed as a guarantor.
By April 28, 2017, First NBC Bank had advanced approximately $46 million to ST. ANGELO and the Entities based on the false personal financial statements and practice of advancing new loan proceeds to cover overdrafts and make payments for prior loans. First NBC Bank had also paid ST. ANGELO an additional $9.6 million dollars in false tax credit investment money.
ST. ANGELO could face up to 30 years’ imprisonment, a fine of more than $1 million or twice the gross gain to him or the gross loss of any victims, five years of supervised release, and a special assessment of $100.
Judge Carl J. Barbier set ST. ANGELO’s sentencing date for October 3, 2019 at 9:30am.
This case is being investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation; the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of Inspector General; and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and Office of Inspector General.

District Man Sentenced to 10 Years in Prison For Multi-Million Dollar Fraud and Money Laundering Schemes
Defendant’s Scams Targeted Companies and Individuals
WASHINGTON - Michael A. Orji, 40, formerly of Washington, D.C., was sentenced today to 10 years in prison on federal charges stemming from his role in at least seven bank fraud schemes, involving at least 10 victims and more than $5.7 million in intended losses.
The announcement was made by U.S. Attorney Jessie K. Liu, John P. Selleck, Acting Assistant Director in Charge of the FBI’s Washington Field Office, and Jay N. Lerner, Inspector General for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).
Orji, a Nigerian national, pled guilty on Oct. 26, 2018, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, to one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. He was sentenced by the Honorable Chief Judge Beryl A. Howell. Orji also was ordered to pay a restitution judgment in the amount of $905,274.98 divided among five victims with uncompensated losses. As part of his plea agreement, Orji additionally agreed to forfeit $75,254 in previously seized funds and pay a forfeiture money judgment in the amount of $1,705,320.03. Following his prison term, he is required to surrender himself to ICE and cooperate with the deportation proceedings to Nigeria.
According to a statement of offense and related conduct acknowledged by Orji, he participated in an ongoing conspiracy from August 2015 through November 2017 to commit a variety of financial frauds, primarily involving stolen checks and business e-mail compromise (BEC) schemes. He then laundered the resulting proceeds through a network of fraudulent bank accounts, shell corporations, and co-conspirators in the District of Columbia and elsewhere. In a typical BEC scheme, a co-conspirator working online tricks a company or individual using “spoofed,” or fake, e-mails into transferring large sums of money into bank accounts controlled by those participating in the crime. Soon after the wire transfers are completed, the co-conspirators drain the bank accounts and launder the criminal proceeds.
In total, Orji participated in at least seven bank fraud schemes involving 10 victims and 15 fraudulent accounts opened and/or controlled by the defendant under false names. The schemes generated a total of $905, 274.98 in actual losses and $5,717,596.23 in intended losses.
He used false aliases and forged driver’s licenses in carrying out the crimes.
The victims of the defendant’s frauds included a public school system, a medical center, several small and medium-sized companies, an individual who happened to call the bank in order to take precautions before an international trip, an individual attempting to purchase a new home, and an individual saving for retirement. Meanwhile, according to the government’s evidence, Orji frequented casinos, which he also used to launder money, and lived in a luxury apartment under a borrowed name.
Orji was arrested on Nov. 20, 2017, and has been in custody ever since. On that day, federal agents executed a search warrant on Orji’s residence in the District of Columbia. During the search, , they found 14 fraudulent driver’s licenses corresponding to the defendant’s false aliases, 1 fraudulent Social Security card in the name of false alias, a printed-out copy of the Wikipedia article on “Bank Fraud,” a copy of a journal article on online banking fraud with handwritten markings, a book on creating false identities, and multiple burner phones.
The case was investigated by the FBI’s Washington Field Office and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation-Office of Inspector General. Assistance was provided by the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, U.S. Secret Service, the District of Columbia Office of the Inspector General, and the Metropolitan Police Department.
The case was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Christopher B. Brown, with assistance from Paralegal Specialist C. Rosalind Pressley.  Assistant U.S. Attorney Andrea Duvall, Computer Crime & Intellectual Property Section Trial Attorney W. Joss Nichols, former Assistant U.S. Attorney John Marston, and former Special Assistant U.S. Attorney Kyle Bateman also assisted in investigating and prosecuting the case.

Former Bank Vice President Who Aided the Obstruction of an FDIC Investigation Sentenced to Federal Prison
Court Also Ordered Defendant to Pay More than $1.2 Million in Restitution
A man who aided the obstruction of an FDIC examination was sentenced on June 13, 2019, to one year and one day in federal prison.
Martin Smith, age 39, from Center Point, Iowa, received the prison term after an August 27, 2018 guilty plea to aiding and abetting the obstruction of an FDIC investigation.
Smith worked as a bank vice president from 2009 to 2012.  Information at sentencing showed that, during a December 2011 FDIC examination, Smith made it appear as though a borrower’s delinquent loans had been refinanced several months prior, which kept regulators from scrutinizing those loans as part of the exam.  Information at sentencing also showed that Smith changed due dates and allowed unauthorized advances on other loans, ultimately causing the bank to incur more than $1 million in losses on loans that the bank never formally authorized and, in some circumstances, never even memorialized.
Smith was sentenced in Cedar Rapids by United States District Court Judge C.J. Williams.  Smith was sentenced to 12 months’ and one day imprisonment.  He was ordered to make $1,270,132.97 in restitution.  He must also serve a 3-year term of supervised release after the prison term.  There is no parole in the federal system.
Smith was released on the bond previously set and is to surrender to the Bureau of Prisons on a date yet to be set.
The case was prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Jacob Schunk and investigated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General and the United States Secret Service.

Indictment: Kansas Couple Stole Millions In Check Kiting Scheme
TOPEKA, KAN. - The owners of the Plainville Livestock Commission in Rooks County are charged with carrying out a check kiting scheme that cost banks millions of dollars, U.S. Attorney Stephen McAllister said today.
A grand jury in Topeka returned the indictment Wednesday.
Tyler Gillum, 47, and his wife, Camden Gillum, 50, both of Plainville, Kan., are charged with 31 counts of bank fraud, one count of making a false statement to the Small Business Administration in an application for a $1.5 million loan, and one count of making a false statement to Almena State Bank in an application for a $500,000 line of credit.
The indictment alleges the Gillums defrauded Almena State Bank in Almena, Kan., Landmark Bank in Manhattan, Kan., Colorado East Bank and Trust in Lamar, Colo., Astra Bank in Scandia, Kan., TBK Bank in Dallas, Guaranty State Bank in Beloit and The Bank in Oberlin, Kan.
The indictment alleges investigators examined unfunded checks and wire transfers totaling more $2 billion sent by Tyler Gillum as part of the scheme. That included 409 wire transfers and 7,584 checks. Tyler Gillum, formerly a loan officer for Montezuma State Bank, owned and operated with his wife Plainville Livestock Commission. In advertisements for the business, they said: “The sale barn facility was first established in 1950 and is situated in the heart of Cow-Calf Country. We pride ourselves in offering individualized attention to marketing your livestock.”
The indictment defines check kiting as a form of check fraud that takes advantage of the time between presentment of a check and the actual receipt of funds (“the float”) to make use of non-existent funds in a checking or other bank account. The purpose of check kiting is to falsely inflate the balance of a checking account in order to allow written checks to clear that otherwise would bounce.
Investigating agencies included the U.S. Department of Agriculture – Office of Inspector General, the FBI, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation – Officer of Inspector General, the Federal Housing Finance Agency – Office of Inspector General and the U.S. Small Business Administration – Office of Inspector General. Assistant U.S. Attorney Rich Hathaway is prosecuting.
I n all cases, defendants are presumed innocent until and unless proven guilty. The indictments merely contain allegations of criminal conduct.

Bank CEO Arrested For Taking Bribes In Connection With Loans Guaranteed By The Small Business Administration,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/bank-ceo-arrested-taking-bribes-connection-loans-guaranteed,"May 29, 2019",2019,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Bank CEO Arrested For Taking Bribes In Connection With Loans Guaranteed By The Small Business Administration
Geoffrey S. Berman, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, announced today the arrest of EDWARD SHIN, the CEO of a Pennsylvania-based bank (the “Bank”), for taking bribes in connection with the Bank’s issuance of loans that were guaranteed by the United States Small Business Administration (“SBA”).  SHIN was arrested pursuant to a criminal complaint charging him with taking bribes by siphoning off a portion of commissions on SBA-guaranteed loans and causing the Bank to issue SBA-guaranteed loans to companies in which SHIN had a secret interest.  The charges are the culmination of a joint investigation by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation – Office of Inspector General (“FDIC-OIG”), Homeland Security Investigations (“HSI”), the SBA Office of the Inspector General (“SBA-OIG”), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”), and the Office of the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (“SIGTARP”).  SHIN is expected for presentment this afternoon in Manhattan federal court before U.S. Magistrate Judge James L. Cott.
U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman said:  “Edward Shin, the CEO of a Pennsylvania bank, allegedly exploited his position as a bank officer to illegally issue Small Business Administration loans to entities in which he had a financial interest.  Furthermore, Shin allegedly took kickbacks on commissions for those loans from a third party who did no legitimate work in the loan process.  The Small Business Administration exists to provide funding to those pursuing the American dream through owning their own businesses.  Edward Shin is now charged with attempting to corrupt that process for his own personal gain.”
According to the allegations in the Criminal Complaint filed in Manhattan federal court today [1] :
The SBA helps Americans start, build, and grow businesses by guaranteeing certain loans made by banks to help those businesses succeed.  Between 2009 and 2012, EDWARD SHIN was the CEO of the Bank.  During that period, the Bank offered a range of financial products, including SBA-guaranteed loans to small businesses in the New York-New Jersey area, which the Bank could extend only on the condition that all aspects of those loans complied with SBA regulations and SBA’s standard operating procedures.  In particular, SBA regulations and procedures prohibited bank officers, including SHIN, from receiving any payments in connection with SBA-backed loans and prohibited banks from extending such loans to any institution in which a bank officer held an interest.
Notwithstanding these regulations, SHIN secretly solicited and received bribe payments in connection with SBA-guaranteed loans issued by the Bank and caused the Bank to extend SBA-guaranteed loans to companies in which SHIN had secret ownership interests.  Specifically, when the Bank issued a business loan involving a certain broker (the “Broker”), SHIN secretly arranged to receive a portion of the Broker’s fee.  On other occasions, when the Bank issued a business loan that did not involve the use of an actual broker, SHIN arranged to have the Broker inserted unnecessarily into the transaction solely to generate a broker fee that could be shared with SHIN; in fact, the Broker did no actual work to earn a commission on those transactions, but split the “broker’s fee” with SHIN as an illegal kickback.
SHIN also arranged for the Bank to issue SBA-guaranteed loans to businesses in which he secretly retained an ownership interest, in violation of SBA regulations and procedures.  For example, in or about December 2010, the Bank issued an SBA-guaranteed loan for approximately $950,000 to a business in New York, New York.  Although documents submitted to the Bank for purposes of securing the loan did not mention SHIN’s ownership interest, the business was secretly operated as a 50-50 partnership between SHIN and the Broker.  After the loan was issued in or about October 2014, this loan went into default status, ultimately resulting in a loss to the SBA of approximately $611,491.
*                      *                      *
SHIN, 56, of Ambler, Pennsylvania, is charged with one count of conspiracy to commit bank bribery, which carries a maximum potential sentence of five years in prison, and one count each of bank bribery, theft of funds by a bank officer, and conspiracy to commit wire fraud, each of which carries a maximum potential sentence of 30 years in prison.  The maximum potential sentences in this case are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendant will be determined by the judge.
Mr. Berman praised the outstanding investigative work of the FDIC-OIG, HSI, FBI, SBA-OIG, and SIGTARP.
This case is being handled by the Office’s Money Laundering and Transnational Criminal Enterprises Unit.  Assistant U.S. Attorneys Daniel M. Tracer and Tara M. La Morte are in charge of the prosecution.

Bank CEO Stephen M. Calk Charged With Corruptly Soliciting A Presidential Administration Position In Exchange For Approving $16 Million In Loans
Audrey Strauss, the Attorney for the United States, Acting Under Authority Conferred by 28 U.S.C. § 515, William F. Sweeney Jr., the Assistant Director-in-Charge of the New York Field Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”), and Patricia Tarasca, the Special Agent-in-Charge of the New York Region for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (“FDIC OIG”), announced today the unsealing of an indictment charging STEPHEN M. CALK with financial institution bribery for corruptly using his position as the head of a federally insured bank to issue millions of dollars in high-risk loans to a borrower in exchange for a personal benefit: assistance from the borrower in obtaining a senior position with an incoming presidential administration.  CALK is expected to be presented this afternoon before U.S. Magistrate Judge Debra Freeman.
Ms. Strauss said:  “As alleged, Stephen M. Calk abused the power entrusted to him as the top official of a federally insured bank by approving millions of dollars in high-risk loans in an effort to secure a personal benefit, namely an appointment as Secretary of the Army or another similarly high-level position in the incoming presidential administration.  Calk’s alleged attempt to obtain such an appointment was unsuccessful, and the loans he approved were ultimately downgraded by the bank’s primary regulator.  Thanks to the outstanding work of the FBI and FDIC OIG, Calk’s alleged corrupt scheme has now resulted in a federal criminal charge.”
FBI Assistant Director William F. Sweeney Jr. said:  “As alleged, Calk went to great lengths to avoid banking violations in an attempt to secure a senior position in a presidential administration. He curried favor with an influential borrower, exploited his position as CEO of a bank and its holding company, and exercised control over the bank and the borrower’s loans, intentionally turning his back on the many red flags posted along the way.  His attempt at petitioning for political favors was unsuccessful in more ways than one – he didn’t get the job he wanted, and he compromised the one he had.”
FDIC OIG Special Agent-in-Charge Patricia Tarasca said:  “Today’s indictment charges Stephen Calk with misusing his position as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of a bank for his own personal gain.  The FDIC Office of Inspector General remains committed to investigating cases where bank officials cause multimillion-dollar losses to a financial institution and undermine its integrity.  We will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to bring to justice those who commit such offenses.”
According to the allegations in the Indictment:-1]
CALK, the Bank, and the Borrower
STEPHEN M. CALK is the chairman and chief executive officer of the “Bank,” a federal savings association headquartered in Chicago, Illinois, with an office in New York, New York.  The Bank is owned in its entirety by the “Holding Company,” a Chicago-based bank holding company, and CALK is the chairman, chief executive officer, and owner of approximately 67% of the Holding Company.
The “Borrower” was, at all relevant times, a lobbyist and political consultant.  Beginning in or about March 2016, the Borrower held a senior role with a presidential campaign (the “Presidential Campaign”), and from June 2016 through August 2016, he served as chairman of the Presidential Campaign.  After the Borrower’s formal role with the Presidential Campaign concluded in or about August 2016, the Borrower continued to be informally involved in the campaign.  Beginning in or about November 2016, when the candidate for whom the Borrower had been working was elected President of the United States, the Borrower provided informal input to the presidential transition team (the “Presidential Transition Team”).
The Corrupt Scheme
Between in or about July 2016 and January 2017, CALK engaged in a corrupt scheme to exploit his position as the head of the Bank and the Holding Company in an effort to secure a valuable personal benefit for himself, namely, the Borrower’s assistance in obtaining for CALK a senior position in the presidential administration.  During this time period, the Borrower sought millions of dollars in loans from the Bank.  CALK understood that the Borrower urgently needed these loans in order to terminate or avoid foreclosure proceedings on multiple properties owned by the Borrower and the Borrower’s family.  Further, CALK believed that the Borrower could use his influence with the Presidential Transition Team to assist CALK in obtaining a senior administration position.
CALK thus sought to leverage his control over the Bank and the loans sought by the Borrower to his personal advantage.  Specifically, CALK offered to, and did, cause the Bank and Holding Company to extend $16 million in loans to the Borrower in exchange for the Borrower’s requested assistance in obtaining a high-level position in the presidential administration.  For example, and while the Borrower’s loans were pending approval, CALK provided the Borrower with a ranked list of the governmental positions he desired, which started with Secretary of the Treasury, and was followed by Deputy Secretary of the Treasury, Secretary of Commerce, and Secretary of Defense, as well as 19 ambassadorships similarly ranked and starting with the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Italy.
In approving these loans to the Borrower, CALK was aware of significant red flags regarding the Borrower’s ability to repay the loans, such as his history of defaulting on prior loans.  Moreover, given the size of the loans, the Borrower’s debt became the single largest lending relationship at the Bank.  In order to enable the Bank to issue these loans without violating the Bank’s legal limit on loans to a single borrower, CALK authorized a maneuver never before performed by the Bank, in which the Holding Company – which CALK also controlled – acquired a portion of the loans from the Bank.
During the same time period, the Borrower provided CALK with valuable personal benefits.  First, in or about the summer of 2016, during the Presidential Campaign – and just days after CALK and the rest of the Bank’s credit committee conditionally approved a proposed $9.5 million loan to the Borrower – the Borrower appointed CALK to a prestigious economic advisory committee affiliated with the campaign.  And second, in or about late November and early December 2016 – after the presidential candidate had been elected president, after the Borrower’s first loan from the Bank had been issued, and while a second set of loans worth more than $6 million sought by the Borrower was pending approval by the Bank – the Borrower used his influence with the Presidential Transition Team to assist Calk, recommending CALK for an administration position.  Due to the Borrower’s efforts, CALK was formally interviewed for the position of Under Secretary of the Army in or about early January 2017 at the Presidential Transition Team’s principal offices in New York, New York.  CALK was not ultimately hired.
As a result of its independent review of the Bank’s loans to the Borrower, in or around July 2017, the bank’s primary regulator, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”), downgraded the credit quality of those loans to “substandard,” concluding that the Bank’s classification of them as satisfactory had been inappropriate.  Moreover, to conceal the unlawful nature of his scheme, CALK made false and misleading statements to the OCC regarding the loans to the Borrower.  Among other things, CALK falsely stated to the OCC regulators that he had never desired a position in the presidential administration.
In or about October 2017, the Borrower was charged with federal crimes and the U.S. Government sought the forfeiture of the Borrower’s interests in properties securing the loans he had received from the Bank.  The Borrower subsequently ceased making loan payments to the Bank, and the Bank and the Holding Company foreclosed on the cash collateral securing the loans and have currently written off the remaining principal balance - totaling over $12 million - as a loss.
STEPHEM M. CALK, 54, is charged with one count of financial institution bribery, which carries a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison.
The statutory maximum penalty is prescribed by Congress and is provided here for informational purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendant would be determined by the judge.
Ms. Strauss praised the outstanding investigative work of the FBI and FDIC OIG.
This case is being handled by the Office’s Public Corruption Unit and Money Laundering and Transnational Criminal Enterprises Unit.  Assistant U.S. Attorneys Paul M. Monteleoni, Douglas S. Zolkind, and Benet J. Kearney are in charge of the prosecution.
The allegations contained in the Indictment are merely accusations, and the defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.
1-As the introductory phrase signifies, the entirety of the text of the Indictment, and the description of the Indictment set forth herein, constitute only allegations, and every fact described should be treated as an allegation.

Ex-Mirae Bank Executive Sentenced to More than 5 Years in Prison for Loan Fraud that Caused Large Losses to the Bank,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/ex-mirae-bank-executive-sentenced-more-5-years-prison-loan-fraud,"May 20, 2019",2019,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Ex-Mirae Bank Executive Sentenced to More than 5 Years in Prison for Loan Fraud that Caused Large Losses to the Bank
LOS ANGELES – The former chief marketing officer at the now-defunct Mirae Bank was sentenced today to 70 months in federal prison for his role in a scheme that caused the Koreatown-based lender to issue more than $15 million in fraudulent loans, and ultimately caused the bank to suffer severe losses.
Ataollah Aminpour, 60, of Beverly Hills, was sentenced today by United States District Judge Dale S. Fischer, who also ordered Aminpour to pay $7,519,084 in restitution. Judge Fischer then remanded Aminpour, who had been on bond, into federal custody to begin serving his sentence immediately.
Aminpour, who is also known as John and Johnny Aminpour, pleaded guilty in December 2017 to one felony count of making a false statement to a financial institution.
According to court documents, Aminpour held himself out as a successful businessman who could help people obtain financing for gas station and car wash businesses with little or no down payment. In some instances, Aminpour would identify a business for the borrower to purchase, and would negotiate the sales price. On the commercial loan applications that Aminpour would submit to the bank on behalf of the borrower, however, Aminpour would overstate the actual purchase price of the business, thereby causing the bank to issue inflated loan amounts that were not fully secured.
From 2005 to 2007, Aminpour, along with other participants, submitted fraudulent commercial loan applications to Mirae Bank, a federally insured financial institution. In his role as a senior bank executive, Aminpour submitted and knowingly caused others to submit false information not only about the true purchase price of the business but also about the assets of the borrowers and the finances of the businesses being purchased. Aminpour also allowed borrowers to circumvent the bank’s down payment requirements by arranging for money to be transferred into escrow accounts so it would falsely appear to Mirae Bank that the borrowers were making large down payments. As a result, borrowers were able to acquire businesses with little to no money down, with Aminpour earning commissions as a result and, in some instances, with Aminpour misappropriating the excess loan proceeds for himself.
For example, Aminpour made false statements to Mirae Bank in an application for a $4.2 million loan in connection with the purchase a car wash in Maywood. When he pleaded guilty, Aminpour admitted that, on the application, he falsely stated that the purchase price of the car wash was $6.65 million when the real purchase price was $3.25 million.
In his plea agreement, Aminpour further admitted that his scheme involved false statements in six loan applications submitted between November 2005 and February 2007 for loans totaling $16.7 million, and that losses on those loans exceeded $7.5 million.
In addition to the loans charged as part of the fraud in this case, Aminpour referred approximately $150 million in loans to Mirae Bank, and the losses on those loans played a significant role in the bank’s collapse in 2009, according to court documents.
After the bank’s failure, the FDIC took over Mirae Bank as its receiver. FDIC and Wilshire Bank, which acquired Mirae Bank’s assets from FDIC, together suffered more than $33 million in losses on the Aminpour-referred loans. Wilshire Bank was subsequently acquired by, and now does business as, Bank of Hope.
The case was investigated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s Office of Inspector General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (SIGTARP), and the Federal Housing Finance Agency’s Office of Inspector General.
This matter is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Kerry L. Quinn of the Major Frauds Section.

New Orleans Business Owner Charged With Conspiracy to Defraud First NBC Bank
NEW ORLEANS – The United States Attorney’s Office announced that KENNETH CHARITY (“CHARITY”), age 54, a resident of New Orleans, Louisiana, was charged Wednesday, May 15, 2019 with conspiracy to defraud First NBC Bank, the New Orleans-based bank that failed in April 2017.
According to the Bill of Information, from in or around February 2007 through April 2017, CHARITYhad a banking relationship with First NBC Bank, individually and through certain entities. During that time, Bank President A acted as the loan officer for CHARITY and the loan officer to certain of CHARITY’s entities (“the Entities”). By the time First NBC Bank failed, the balances on the loans issued to CHARITY and the entities totaled more than $18 million. CHARITY, Bank President A, and others knowingly conspired to defraud First NBC Bank. According to the Bill of Information, the purpose of the conspiracy was for CHARITY, Bank President A, and others to unjustly enrich themselves, disguise the true financial status of CHARITY and the Entities, conceal the accurate performance, and misrepresenting the purpose of the loans made to KENNETH CHARITY and the Entities.
KENNETH CHARITY, Bank President A, and others provided First NBC Bank with materially false and fraudulent documents and financial statements, which, among other things, overstated the value of KENNETH CHARITY’s assets, understated his liabilities, and omitted material information. These false statements disguised his and the Entities’ true financial condition.
The Bill of Information also alleges that it was part of the conspiracy for Bank President A and others to disguise CHARITY and the Entities’ true financial condition by, among other things, issuing new loans to CHARITY and the Entities, which would pay older loans that CHARITY was unable to repay. The new loans would then appear to be current and performing, while the old loans appeared to have been paid. In reality, CHARITY had insufficient income and cash flow to support his debt at First NBC Bank. Bank President A was well-aware that CHARITY was unable to repay his loans, yet Bank President A continued to falsely represent in bank records that CHARITY and his Entities were profitable.
Additionally, the Bill of Information alleges CHARITY, Bank President A, and others, carried out the conspiracy by repeatedly lying in bank loan documents about the purpose of loans that Bank President A approved for CHARITY and the Entities. Specifically, Bank President A approved loans for CHARITY and his Entities that appeared to be for legitimate business purposes. In reality, CHARITY spent loan proceeds on personal expenses. Bank President A was aware that CHARITY did not spend the loan proceeds consistently with the purposes stated on the loan documents. For example, from in or around August 2014 through in or around December 2016, Bank President A caused three loans to be disbursed to one of CHARITY’s entities for the purpose, in part, of enclosing a patio at a beignet shop located at 620 Decatur Street. CHARITY never built the patio. The loan proceeds were used instead to pay CHARITY’soverdrafts, which included personal expenses, and made loan payments.
First Assistant United States Attorney Michael Simpson stated that a Bill of Information is merely an accusation and that the guilt of the defendant must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.
This case is being investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation; the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of Inspector General; and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Office of Inspector General. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Sharan E. Lieberman, Matthew R. Payne, Nicholas D. Moses, and J. Ryan McLaren are in charge of the prosecution.

Smiths Grove Businessman Pleads Guilty To Bank Fraud
Kentuckyana Jones admits to over $1.4 million in bank fraud
LOUISVILLE, Ky. – Michael Todd Barrick, aka Kentuckyana Jones, age 56, of Smiths Grove, Kentucky, pleaded guilty to five counts of bank fraud on Monday in United States District Court in Louisville, announced United States Attorney Russell M. Coleman.  Barrick also stipulated to a loss of over $1.4 million.  Barrick’s codefendants, Roger Hagan, Lorri Hughes, and Garry Hammer, all pleaded guilty in April.
According to Barrick’s plea agreement and other documents filed in the case, in 2007 Barrick and his co-defendant, Roger Hagan, agreed that Hagan would purchase property at 302 Laurel Street in Smiths Grove from Barrick for $575,000, but Barrick would make all loan payments and keep all rental income.  Hagan did not have sufficient assets and income to qualify for the loan, but at Barrick’s direction Hagan submitted a fraudulent financial statement to American Bank & Trust (AB&T) that substantially overstated Hagan’s assets and income.  Based on these fraudulent representations, AB&T approved Hagan for the loan.  Barrick paid Hagan’s $118,977.50 loan down payment, and gave Hagan $21,422.50 as payment for participating in the transaction.  The loan went into default in November 2010.
In 2008, Hagan entered a similar agreement with Barrick to purchase 708 Kelly Road in Bowling Green for $300,000.  At Barrick’s direction, Hagan again submitted a fraudulent financial statement to PBI Bank.  Based on these fraudulent representations, PBI approved Hagan for the loan.  After the loan closed Barrick paid Hagan $6,534 for participating in the transaction, and the loan went into default in March 2010.
In 2011, Barrick recruited co-defendant Lorri Hughes to purchase a Wholesale Mattress Warehouse (WMW) from Barrick for $179,000.  The WMW was purportedly located at 1700 N. Dixie Highway in Louisville, but in reality a McDonalds restaurant operated at that address, and had been there for many years.  At Barrick’s direction, Hughes submitted a fraudulent financial statement to Monticello Bank that substantially overstated her income and assets.  Based on these fraudulent representations, Monticello Bank approved the loan, and after the loan closed Barrick paid Hughes $20,000 for participating in the transaction.  The loan went into default in February 2012.
In 2010, Barrick recruited T.P. to purchase Som’ Beach Tanning (SBT), a business located at 140 River Place Avenue in Bowling Green, from Barrick.  At Barrick’s direction, T.P. submitted a fraudulent financial statement to Monticello Bank that substantially overstated his assets.  The loan was supposed to be collateralized by SBT’s equipment, but Barrick had already used that equipment as collateral in a separate December 2009 loan from BB&T Bank, and that BB&T loan was not satisfied.  Based on these fraudulent representations, co-defendant Garry Hammer, a Monticello Bank loan officer, approved the loan, and after the loan closed Barrick paid T.P. $5,000 for participating in the transaction, but Barrick never surrendered control of the business.
In late 2010, Barrick recruited R.R. to purchase a Mattress City Wholesale (MCW) from Barrick for $179,880.  Under the terms of their agreement, R.R. would own the business on paper and would receive a small percentage of profits, but Barrick would pay the taxes, insurance, and all loan payments, and would receive the majority of profits.  The paperwork Barrick submitted reflected that the MCW was located at 2201 Gallatin Road in Madison, Tennessee.  In reality, a PetSmart was located at that address, and had been there for many years.  Based on these fraudulent representations, Monticello Bank, through co-defendant Garry Hammer, approved the loan.  After the loan closed, Barrick paid R.R. $30,000 for participating in the transaction, and used a significant portion of the remaining proceeds to pay off T.P.’s SBT loan.  The R.R. loan went into default in February 2012.
Barrick is scheduled to be sentenced by United States District Court Judge Joseph McKinley in Bowling Green on August 15, 2019, at 9:30 a.m., and faces a statutory maximum penalty of 150 years in prison.  Roger Hagan, Lorri Hughes and Garry Hammer are all scheduled to be sentenced in Bowling Green on July 9, 2019.
This case is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys David Weiser and Josh Judd and was investigated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the FBI.

New Jersey Man Pleads Guilty to Federal Charges for $3.5 Million Bank Fraud Scheme,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/new-jersey-man-pleads-guilty-federal-charges-35-million-bank,"April 25, 2019",2019,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

New Jersey Man Pleads Guilty to Federal Charges for $3.5 Million Bank Fraud Scheme
Baltimore, Maryland – Mehul Khatiwala, age 37, of Voorhees, New Jersey, pleaded guilty today to conspiracy to commit bank fraud and to three counts of bank fraud, in connection with a scheme to fraudulently obtain loans from Cecil Bank to purchase hotels and a multifamily residential property, resulting in losses of more than $3.5 million.
The guilty plea was announced by United States Attorney for the District of Maryland Robert K. Hur; Special Agent in Charge Robert Manchak of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), Office of Inspector General; Special Agent in Charge Patricia Tarasca of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC); Special Inspector General Christy Goldsmith Romero of the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (SIGTARP); and Inspector General Hannibal “Mike” Ware of the Small Business Administration - Office of Inspector General.
“Mehul Khatiwala and his co-conspirators submitted false statements and fraudulent documentation in order to obtain more than $15 million in loans from Cecil Bank, much of which was guaranteed by the SBA.” said U.S. Attorney Robert K. Hur.  “The defendants used deceit to steal millions of dollars from the victims, which ended up including not only the bank but the American taxpayers.  Federal law enforcement are committed to prosecuting and deterring this type of costly fraud.”
According to his plea agreement, from February 2011 through January 2014, Khatiwala and two co-conspirators executed a scheme to defraud Cecil Bank, the Small Business Administration (SBA), and other financial institutions by misrepresenting material facts in order to obtain financing for the purchase of two hotels and a multifamily residential property.  The defendant defaulted on the loans, causing losses to Cecil Bank and the SBA of more than $3.5 million.  According to the indictment and information presented at today’s plea hearing, on December 23, 2008, Cecil Bank’s holding company, Cecil Bankcorp, Inc., received an $11.5 million bailout from the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP).
Specifically, beginning in approximately April 2011, Khatiwala and Conspirator A made plans to apply for a $5 million loan at Cecil Bank to purchase the Memphis Airport Hotel in Memphis, Tennessee, as well as a $1.6 million loan to renovate that hotel.  In order to obtain a loan, Khatiwala concealed Conspirator A’s 80% ownership of the borrowing entity because Conspirator A had already reached his legal lending limit at Cecil Bank.  In May 2011, Cecil Bank’s Board of Directors approved the $5 million loan, with the condition that it be guaranteed by the SBA.  The SBA required Khatiwala, as the purported 100% owner of the borrowing entity, to show that he had equity in the borrowing entity, or cash on hand of approximately $1.8 million.  Conspirator B, who was an employee at another bank, falsely verified that Khatiwala had over $2 million on deposit at the co-conspirator’s bank.  Khatiwala admitted that he signed and submitted this statement, which he knew to be false.  The SBA approved its 75% guarantee of the $5 million loan funded by Cecil Bank.  The loan went into default in January 2015.
Khatiwala and others owned the Best Western Hotel in York, Pennsylvania.  In 2007, they refinanced a loan for this property in the amount of $6.635 million.  In early 2010, Khatiwala and his co-owners became delinquent on the loan and began discussions with the loan servicing company.  In August 2011, Khatiwala reached an agreement with the loan servicer to accept a discounted payoff of $3.625 million on the unpaid principal balance of approximately $6.6 million.  Khatiwala submitted fraudulent documentation and a fraudulent settlement statement to the loan servicer showing that the funds were being provided by a private lender.  In fact, Khatiwala had arranged for the sale of the hotel to related parties for the sum of $4.3 million.  As early as April 2011, prior to the time the defendant made the misrepresentations to the loan servicer to negotiate the payoff, he began implementing the second step of his short-sale fraud scheme by arranging the sale of the hotel to Person B and one of Khatiwala’s employees.  Khatiwala fraudulently obtained a $3.225 million loan from Cecil Bank, which was guaranteed by the SBA. During the loan application review and underwriting process performed by Cecil Bank and the SBA, Khatiwala submitted false documents as to the ownership of the selling and purchasing entities, as well as false financial statements for the purchasers.  Khatiwala knew that the funds paid at closing would come from Khatiwala’s own personal bank account and other businesses, not from the purchasers, as was falsely represented to the bank and the SBA, in order to obtain approval of the loan.  As a result of this short-sale fraud, the original holder of the note on the Best Western Hotel lost $675,000, which instead went to Khatiwala.
Finally, Khatiwala admitted that beginning in February 2011, he negotiated the purchase of a multifamily residential property in Perryville, Maryland.  In order to obtain the loan, he established a company to serve as the borrowing and purchasing entity, representing to Cecil Bank that Persons A and B, a husband and wife, were the 100% owners of the company, and Khatiwala was the manager.  In fact, Conspirator A owned 50% of the company and agreed to serve as guarantor on the loan.  The bank approved a $7,122,500 loan for the purchase of the property with Persons A and B as the 100% owners of the purchasing entity.  On about March 28, 2011, several days before settlement, Khatiwala e-mailed to Conspirator A an Amended and Restated Operating Agreement reflecting Conspirator A’s 50% interest in the property and his agreement to indemnify Persons A and B for any loss, cost, liability or expense arising in connection with any enforcement of Cecil Bank’s rights under the loan guarantee agreement.  Khatiwala, Conspirator A, and Persons A and B signed the Amended Agreement; however, that material fact and document were never disclosed to Cecil Bank before or after the settlement, thus concealing Conspirator A’s ownership interest in the property.  As early as February 2012, the loan payments of approximately $29,000 per month became delinquent and the loan went into default.  Cecil Bank ultimately sold the note to a private lender for $3.252 million in lieu of foreclosure, incurring a loss of $3,583.170.
Khatiwala faces a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison on each of the four counts.  U.S. District Judge Deborah K. Chasanow has scheduled sentencing for September 10, 2019, at 2:30 p.m.
United States Attorney Robert K. Hur commended the FHFA, the FDIC, SIGTARP, and the SBA-OIG, for their work in the investigation.  Mr. Hur thanked Assistant U.S. Attorneys Martin J. Clarke and Harry M. Gruber, who are prosecuting the case.

Bergen County, New Jersey, Real Estate Developer Admits Conspiracy To Deceive Mariner’s Bank And FDIC
NEWARK, N.J. – An Englewood, New Jersey-based real estate developer today admitted his role in a conspiracy to illegally obtain nominee loans from Mariner’s Bank, U.S. Attorney Craig Carpenito announced.
James Demetrakis, 79, pleaded guilty before U.S. District Judge Jose L. Linares in Newark federal court to an information charging him with one count of conspiracy to make false entries to deceive a financial institution and the FDIC.
According to documents filed in this case, a related case against Fred Daibes and Michael McManus, and statements made in court:
Demetrakis’ longtime business partner, Daibes, was the founder and, until April 2011, chairman of the board of directors, at Mariner’s Bank. The bank was subject to federal banking regulations that placed limits on the amount of money that the bank could lend to a single borrower. Between January 2008 and December 2013, Demetrakis conspired with Daibes and others to orchestrate a nominee loan scheme designed to circumvent the lending limits by ensuring that millions of dollars in loans flowed from Mariner’s Bank to the nominees to Daibes, while concealing from both Mariner’s Bank and the FDIC Daibes’ beneficial interests in those loans.
Demetrakis served as the nominee for a $1.8 million line of credit and recruited two of his relatives to serve as nominees for a $2.625 million loan. After receiving the proceeds of the loans, Demetrakis and the other nominees distributed these monies to Daibes. Daibes and the nominees, including Demetrakis, failed to disclose to Mariner’s Bank that Daibes arranged to make both the interest and principal payments on the loans.
The nominee loans became delinquent on certain occasions when Daibes failed to give the nominees, including Demetrakis, the funds to make the monthly payments. After the FDIC began an investigation into one of the loans, Daibes, McManus, and others created and submitted to the FDIC a false, backdated sales contract to make it appear as though Demetrakis had obtained the $1.8 million loan from Mariner’s Bank in order to pay Daibes for his interest in a real estate venture.
Daibes and McManus were indicted Oct. 30, 2018, on conspiracy and bank fraud charges, which remain pending. The charges and allegations against them are merely accusations, and they are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.
The conspiracy charge to which Demetrakis pleaded guilty carries a statutory maximum of five years in prison and a maximum fine of $250,000. Sentencing is scheduled for July 23, 2019.
U.S. Attorney Carpenito credited special agents from the U.S. Attorney’s Office, under the direction of Supervisory Special Agent Thomas Mahoney; special agents of the FDIC, Office of Inspector General, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Patricia Tarasca in New York; and special agents of the FBI, under the direction of Special Agent in Charge Gregory W. Ehrie in Newark, with the investigation leading to today’s guilty plea.
The government is represented by Assistant U.S. Attorney Rahul Agarwal, Deputy Chief of the Criminal Division, and Assistant U.S. Attorney Sean Farrell of the U.S. Attorney’s Office’s Special Prosecutions Division.

Charity Executives, Arkansas State Senator Indicted for Embezzlement and Public Corruption Scheme
SPRINGFIELD, Mo. – Two former executives of a Springfield, Mo.-based charity and an Arkansas state senator have been indicted by a federal grand jury for their roles in a multi-million-dollar public corruption scheme that involved embezzlement, bribes and illegal campaign contributions for elected public officials in Missouri and Arkansas, announced U.S. Attorney Tim Garrison of the Western District of Missouri  and Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division.
Bontiea Bernedette Goss, 63, her husband, Tommy Ray Goss, also known as “Tom,” 63, residents of Springfield, Mo., and Boulder, Colo., and Jeremy Young Hutchinson, 45, of Little Rock, Ark., were charged on March 29, 2019, in a 32-count indictment by a federal grand jury in Springfield, Mo., which was unsealed today.
The indictment alleges that the Gosses, who were high-level executives at Preferred Family Healthcare, Inc. (formerly known as Alternative Opportunities, Inc.), and Hutchinson, who is an attorney and served as a state senator in the Arkansas Senate from 2011 to 2018, along with others, participated in a conspiracy from 2005 to November 2017 to embezzle and misapply the funds of a charitable organization that received federal funds, to pay bribes and kickbacks to elected officials (including Hutchinson), and to deprive the citizens of Arkansas of their right to the honest services of those elected officials. According to the indictment, in exchange for the bribes and kickbacks offered by the Gosses and other co-conspirators, Hutchinson and other elected officials allegedly provided favorable legislative and official action for the charity, including directing funds from the state’s General Improvement Fund (GIF).
The indictment also alleges that the Gosses and others defrauded the charity, and the governmental entities that funded the charity, by embezzling and misapplying charity funds for their personal benefit, including, but not limited to:
•    causing the charity to pay for chartered air flights for the Gosses to commute between their home in Colorado and their work at the charity’s office in Springfield;•    providing millions of dollars in interest-free loans to their for-profit companies;•    charging the charity inflated prices to lease vehicles from their for-profit companies;•    renting charity-owned commercial real estate to one of their for-profit companies at below-market rates or, in some instances, for free; and•    using charity funds to pay for personal services for themselves, including child and pet care, housekeeping and cleaning their personal residences, picking up and delivering groceries, and shoveling snow, among other personal services paid for by the charity.
The indictment also contains a forfeiture allegation, which would require the Gosses and Hutchinson to forfeit to the government any property obtained from the proceeds of the alleged offenses.
The charity was known as Alternative Opportunities, Inc. from its founding in 1991 until its 2015 merger with Preferred Family Healthcare. The charity, which is cooperating with federal investigators, provided a variety of services to individuals in Missouri, Arkansas, Kansas, Oklahoma and Illinois, including mental and behavioral health treatment and counseling, substance abuse treatment and counseling, employment assistance, aid to individuals with developmental disabilities and medical services.
The charges contained in this indictment are simply accusations, and not evidence of guilt. Evidence supporting the charges must be presented to a federal trial jury, whose duty is to determine guilt or innocence.
This case is the culmination of a two-and-a-half-year investigation, and is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Steven M. Mohlhenrich of the Western District of Missouri; Trial Attorney Marco A. Palmieri with the Public Integrity Section of the Department of Justice’s Criminal Division; Special Assistant U.S. Attorney Ben Wulff of the Western District of Arkansas; and Special Assistant U.S. Attorney Stephanie Mazzanti of the Eastern District of Arkansas. It was investigated by IRS-Criminal Investigation, the FBI, and the Offices of the Inspectors General from the Departments of Justice, Labor, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). This is a combined investigation with the Western District of Arkansas, the Eastern District of Arkansas, and the Public Integrity Section of the Department of Justice.

Husband Of Former Employee Of New Jersey Bank Sentenced To 27 Months In Prison For Stealing Client Information And Funds
Geoffrey S. Berman, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, announced that two defendants have been sentenced to prison by U.S. District Judge Gregory H. Woods in connection with a scheme to steal client information and funds from a bank.  SECONEY BROWN and ANTOINETTE MITCHELL-BROWN, who are married, previously pled guilty to participating in a conspiracy to commit bank fraud.
U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman said:  “Antoinette Mitchell-Brown stole client information from a bank at which she was employed and, with the help of her husband, Seconey Brown, used that information in an attempt to steal hundreds of thousands of dollars from the bank customers.  Now, they have been sentenced to prison.”
According to the allegations in the Indictment filed in connection with this case, other filings in Manhattan federal court, and statements made at the sentencing hearings in this case:
From September 2016 until December 2016, BROWN and MITCHELL-BROWN engaged in a scheme to fraudulently obtain funds from more than 25 accounts at Bank-1, at which MITCHELL-BROWN was then employed.  In furtherance of the scheme, MITCHELL-BROWN stole victims’ bank account information from her employer and used that information to, among other things, write checks for thousands of dollars from victims’ accounts and initiate wire transfers from victims’ accounts to bank accounts controlled by members of the scheme.  BROWN, among other things, paid members of the scheme or otherwise induced other individuals (some of whom provided unwitting assistance) to cash or deposit the fraudulent checks from MITCHELL-BROWN, and to provide the proceeds to BROWN, or, at BROWN’s direction, other individuals.  In total, the defendants’ scheme fraudulently obtained almost $100,000 and attempted to obtain at least an additional $660,000.
*                *                *
In addition to the prison term, BROWN, 26, of East Orange, New Jersey, was sentenced to 2 years of supervised release, and was ordered to pay $93,123.14 in restitution.

Suburban Bank Fraud Schemers Sentenced to Prison and Ordered to Pay $14.3 Million in Restitution,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/suburban-bank-fraud-schemers-sentenced-prison-and-ordered-pay,"April 5, 2019",2019,"

Suburban Bank Fraud Schemers Sentenced to Prison and Ordered to Pay $14.3 Million in Restitution
CHICAGO — A federal judge in Chicago has sentenced several defendants in a bank fraud scheme to prison terms and ordered them to pay more than $14.3 million in restitution.
CHARNPAL GHUMAN, 39, of Palatine, and AGA KHAN, 39, of Bloomingdale, were business partners who “flipped” gas stations by purchasing them and re-selling to buyers whom Ghuman and Khan knew were not qualified to obtain bank financing.  The pair conspired with a loan officer inside American Enterprise Bank to submit false application documents to obtain loans from the bank guaranteed by the U.S. Small Business Administration.  An accountant participated in the scheme by furnishing AEB with false tax returns to help get more than half of the loan applicants qualified for financing.  From 2006 to 2009, Ghuman and Khan obtained more than $40 million in loan proceeds as a result of the scheme.
Ghuman and Khan pleaded guilty to bank fraud charges, as did the loan officer, AKASH BRAHMBHATT, 44, of Spring, Texas, and the accountant, SHITAL MEHTA, 53, of Elk Grove Village.
U.S. District Judge John J. Tharp, Jr., on Thursday ordered restitution to AEB of $14,343,899.  Judge Tharp had previously sentenced all four defendants to prison terms.
The sentences and restitution order were announced by John R. Lausch, Jr., United States Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois; Jeffrey S. Sallet, Special Agent-in-Charge of the Chicago office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation; and Gabriel L. Grchan, Special Agent-in-Charge of the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation Division in Chicago.  The SBA and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. assisted in the investigation.
According to evidence in the case, Ghuman and Khan set up various corporate entities that purchased multiple gas stations in Illinois and other areas of the Midwest for immediate resale at a higher price.  Ghuman and Khan arranged for the financing on behalf of the buyers through AEB loans, which were guaranteed by the SBA if certain requirements were met, including that the borrowers provide a percentage of equity.  Ghuman and Khan worked with Brahmbhatt to falsify the loan applications, which included false statements regarding the buyers’ income, employment and experience, as well as false tax returns submitted by Mehta.  Ghuman and Khan also falsified equity payments required by the buyers.
“Ghuman and Khan walked away with millions of dollars in loan proceeds, while the borrowers defaulted, leaving the bank’s loss in the millions of dollars,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Sheri H. Mecklenburg argued in the government’s sentencing memorandum.  “This was not a one-time lapse in judgment.  Defendants’ fraud was repeated and ongoing, over the course of years.”
Judge Tharp ordered prison terms and restitution for each of the defendants:
Ghuman: Five years and six months in prison; restitution of $11,843,899, of which $2 million is owed personally and the remainder owed jointly with Khan.  Ghuman also received a concurrent sentence of three years in prison and was ordered to pay $1,952,653 to the IRS after also pleading guilty to filing a false tax return.
Khan: Three years in prison; restitution of $10,843,899, of which $1 million is owed personally and the remainder owed jointly with Ghuman.
Brahmbhatt: Three years in prison; restitution of $10,843,899, of which $1 million is owed personally and the remainder owed jointly with Ghuman.
Mehta: One year and one day in prison; restitution of $500,000, owed personally.

Bank General Counsel Charged With Conspiracy to Defraud First NBC Bank,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/bank-general-counsel-charged-conspiracy-defraud-first-nbc-bank,"March 22, 2019",2019,"

Bank General Counsel Charged With Conspiracy to Defraud First NBC Bank
NEW ORLEANS – The United States Attorney’s Office announced that GREGORY ST. ANGELO (“ST ANGELO”), age 54, a resident of St. Tammany Parish, was charged today with conspiracy to defraud First NBC Bank, the New Orleans-based bank that failed in April 2017.
According to the Bill of Information, from in or around 2006 through the fall of 2016, ST. ANGELO was the general counsel of First NBC Bank. During this time, he and several businesses owned or controlled by him (the “Entities”) were First NBC Bank borrowers. Bank President A was a founder of First NBC Bank and acted as its president and Chief Executive Officer from in or around May 2006, until in or around December 2016. From in or around 2006 through April 2017, Bank Officer B was employed by First NBC Bank as its Chief Credit Officer, and was responsible for, among other things, the overall quality of the bank’s lending function.
Beginning at a time unknown, but at least in or around 2006, through in and around April 2017, in the Eastern District of Louisiana and elsewhere, the defendant, ST. ANGELO , and others known and unknown conspired to defraud First NBC Bank by means of false and fraudulent pretenses, representations, and promises, relating to a material fact.
The purpose of the conspiracy was for the defendant, ST. ANGELO , Bank President A, Bank Officer B, and others to enrich themselves unjustly by disguising the true financial status of ST. ANGELO , the Entities, and other borrowers, concealing the accurate performance of loans, and misrepresenting the nature of payments to ST. ANGELO and certain Entities.
ST. ANGELO , Bank President A, Bank Officer B, and others sought to accomplish the conspiracy by engaging in the below activities:
ST. ANGELO , Bank President A, Bank Officer B, and others provided First NBC Bank with materially false and fraudulent documents and personal financial statements, which, among other things, overstated the value of ST. ANGELO ’s and the Entities’ assets, understated their liabilities, and omitted material information. The materially false and fraudulent personal financial statements, collateral summaries, and other documents concealed ST. ANGELO ’s and the Entities’ true financial condition.
Bank President A, Bank Officer B, and others disguised ST. ANGELO ’s and the Entities’ true financial condition by, among other things, issuing new loans to ST. ANGELO and certain Entities to pay older loans that ST. ANGELO was unable to repay and to cover his overdrafts. The new loans then appeared to be current, while the old loans and overdrafts appeared to have been paid. In reality, the new loans were designed to avert the downgrading or impairment of ST. ANGELO ’s and several Entities’ loans and to avoid reporting them as nonperforming or losses to the bank.
Another means the conspirators used to disguise ST. ANGELO ’s and the Entities’ true financial condition was to extend the maturity date of older loans on which ST. ANGELO was unable to make payments, which allowed First NBC Bank to avoid downgrading, impairing, or reporting the loans as nonperforming or losses to the bank.
Bank President A, Bank Officer B, and others funded fraudulent tax credit investments that First NBC Bank purportedly made in certain Entities owned by ST. ANGELO . In reality, the supposed investments simply funneled money from First NBC Bank’s general ledger to ST. ANGELO and certain Entities, so that ST. ANGELO could make his loan payments and cure overdrafts, and so the bank could avoid downgrading, impairing, or reporting the loans as nonperforming or losses to the bank.
On multiple occasions, Bank President A and ST. ANGELO executed false documents entitled “Agreements to Purchase Tax Credits” designed to make it appear that First NBC Bank was paying ST. ANGELO money in exchange for ownership interests in entities supposedly owned by ST. ANGELO . In reality, these agreements were a way for Bank President A, Bank Officer B, and ST. ANGELO to justify the diversion of bank funds to ST. ANGELO and certain Entities to cure overdrafts and avoid reporting requirements. On multiple occasions, Bank Officer B directed the disbursement of payments to ST. ANGELO and certain Entities from First NBC Bank’s general ledger, purportedly for tax credit investments, knowing that the tax credit investments were false.
Yet another means by which Bank President A, ST. ANGELO , Bank Officer B, and others concealed the true financial condition of ST. ANGELO ’s loans was to lend funds to ST. ANGELO ’s associates as nominees. Bank President A and ST. ANGELO caused the nominees to sign loan documents, making it appear that the nominee entity was taking out the loan solely for its own use. In fact, the loan proceeds often were paid to ST. ANGELO or the Entities, not the nominees, and were, in part, used to pay ST. ANGELO ’s and the Entities’ existing debts to First NBC Bank or to enrich ST. ANGELO .
ST. ANGELO , Bank President A, and Bank Officer B caused employees of First NBC Bank to transfer the nominee loan proceeds directly to ST. ANGELO ’s or the Entities’ deposit accounts, when ST. ANGELO , Bank President A, and Bank Officer B knew the loans were not solely for the nominee, but benefitted ST. ANGELO , who was not named in the loan documents or listed as a guarantor.
By April 28, 2017, First NBC Bank had advanced approximately $46 million to ST. ANGELO and the Entities based on the false personal financial statements, and practice of advancing loans to cover overdrafts and make loan payments. First NBC Bank had also paid ST. ANGELO an additional $9.6 million dollars in false tax credit investment money.
If found guilty, ST. ANGELO could face up to 30 years’ imprisonment, a fine of more than $1 million or twice the gross gain to him or the gross loss of any victims, five years of supervised release, and a special assessment of $100.
First Assistant United States Attorney Michael Simpson stated that a Bill of Information is merely an accusation and that the guilt of the defendant must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.
This case is being investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation; the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of Inspector General; and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Office of Inspector General. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Sharan E. Lieberman, Matthew R. Payne, Nicholas D. Moses, and J. Ryan McLaren are in charge of the prosecution.

Former Henry County Bank Executive Sentenced to Prison for Bank Fraud
Jackson, TN – A former bank executive has been sentenced to twelve months and one day in federal prison for bank fraud. U.S. Attorney D. Michael Dunavant announced the sentence today.
According to information presented in court, from May 16, 2005 through October 7, 2015, Robert Daniel Newcomb, Jr., was employed in Paris, Tennessee, as a vice president/branch manager at the FDIC-insured bank known as FirstBank, Bartlett, Tennessee. James Curtis Hobbs was a long-time bank customer of Newcomb’s. Hobbs was in the business of buying, refurbishing and selling tractors through ""Southern Associates, Inc."" Newcomb was conducting a similar business on his own in addition to his banking duties.
In 2012, Hobbs began selling tractors on behalf of Newcomb. Hobbs would recondition and sell the tractors, withhold his expenses and commissions from the sales and give Newcomb payment for the tractors.
In 2014, Hobbs purchased and sold a tractor on behalf of Newcomb. Before Hobbs could give Newcomb his $7,400 profit from the sale, Hobbs’ wife spent the money. Newcomb then fraudulently renewed and increased Hobbs’ FirstBank loan by $7,400 in the name ""Southern Associates, Inc."" Newcomb used the funds to pay off the loan on the tractor, which was then defaulted at a loss to FirstBank in the amount of $118,390.45.
On March 12, 2019, Chief United States District Court Judge S. Thomas Anderson sentenced Newcomb to twelve months and one day imprisonment. He was also ordered to serve two years supervised release and to pay restitution of $110,990.45.
U.S. Attorney D. Michael Dunavant said, ""The financial fraud committed by this defendant is disturbing. The abuse of his position of trust and authority as a bank vice president for his own personal gain had a significant negative impact on the shareholders, employees and customers of FirstBank. The U.S. Attorney’s Office places a high priority on protecting the security and integrity of transactions, deposits and assets of financial institutions, and this case demonstrates that commitment.""
""The FDIC Office of Inspector General is pleased to join the U.S. Attorney’s Office in bringing Mr. Newcomb to justice. We are especially concerned when trusted insiders abuse their positions to harm the financial institutions that employ them. We will continue our efforts to investigate such abuses in FDIC-insured financial institutions throughout the country,"" said Laurie L. Younger, Special Agent-in-Charge, FDIC - Office of the Inspector General, Dallas Region.
This case was investigated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation – Office of the Inspector General.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Matt Wilson prosecuted this case on the government’s behalf.

Former Bank Tellers Sentenced To Prison, Ordered To Pay Back $1.6 Million To The Peoples Bank In Eatonton
MACON – Two former bank tellers were sentenced today to prison and ordered to pay more than $1.6 million dollars to the institution they defrauded, announced Charles “Charlie” Peeler, the U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Georgia. Vicky Martin, 60, of Buckhead (Morgan County), and Brandy Mize, 42, of Eatonton, pled guilty in December to one count of Conspiracy to Defraud a Financial Institution. The Honorable Tillman E. “Tripp” Self sentenced Ms. Martin to 21 months imprisonment and Ms. Mize to 41 months imprisonment, five years supervised release and were ordered to pay restitution jointly and severally to The Peoples Bank in Eatonton, Georgia the entire amount stolen, $1,663,205.25. There is no parole in the federal prison system.
According to the plea agreement, Ms. Mize was the Head Teller and Ms. Martin was employed as the Assistant Head Teller at The People’s Bank. The defendants used their positions of trust starting sometime during 2012 or 2013 to embezzle and misapply bank money by transferring bank funds into their personal bank accounts or into the accounts of family members and associates. The defendants took cash from their teller drawers and, in Ms. Mize’s case, directly from the vault. The defendants also issued cashier’s checks for their benefit, all without valid checks or cash being deposited to the bank to support these transactions. The bank began their internal investigation in March 2016, following reports from colleagues regarding suspicious activity on the bank’s general ledger. The defendants were suspended on March 14, 2016. In all, $1,663,205.25 was stolen from The Peoples Bank.
“Scheming to make money by lying and defrauding others will land you in prison,” said Charles “Charlie” Peeler, the U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Georgia. “It’s a top priority of the U.S. Attorney’s Office to protect law abiding citizens and businesses from fraud. The money these defendants stole should have been used to benefit the bank and its employees, shareholders and account holders, not to enrich Ms. Mize and Ms. Martin.  With the assistance of our law enforcement partners, we will continue to uncover these conspiracies and prosecute people who abuse their positions of trust.”
“Greed got the best of these two bank employees and this sentencing should make it clear that it wasn’t worth it,” said Chris Hacker, Special Agent in Charge of FBI Atlanta. “People in positions of trust must realize if they violate that trust the FBI and federal prosecutors will use every resource possible to make sure they are held accountable.”
""Today's sentence demonstrates the importance of holding people accountable for their crimes, especially those in positions of trust that financial institutions and customers rely on daily to ensure the safety and soundness of banks,"" said FDIC OIG Special Agent in Charge Kyle A. Myles. ""We thank our law enforcement partners for their cooperation in bringing this case to justice.”
The case was investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Atlanta and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC OIG), Atlanta. Assistant United States Attorney Paul McCommon is prosecuting the case for the Government.

Bradley Chiropractor, Former Office Manager Guilty of Fraud, Tax Charges
URBANA, Ill. – A chiropractor who previously owned and operated the Bradley Chiropractic Clinic, located in Bradley, Ill., pleaded guilty today to wire fraud and failure to file tax returns. Joseph Mayotte, 72, of Kankakee, Ill., appeared in Urbana before Chief U.S. District Judge James E. Shadid. Mayotte’s trial had been scheduled to begin today with jury selection. Sentencing is scheduled on June 7, 2019. The clinic’s former office manager, Constance Leadingham, aka Connie, had previously pleaded guilty to bank fraud and filing false income tax returns and is scheduled to be sentenced on March 1, 2019.
Mayotte admitted that from January 2007 to October 2015, he executed a scheme to defraud Blue Cross / Blue Shield Insurance by submitting false billing claims. The false claims were typically made on behalf of patients for whom the clinic had not provided any services or were made in excess of the actual services provided. As a result, Blue Cross / Blue Shield paid the clinic more than $250,000 to which it was not entitled. Mayotte then used the money for his own benefit. In addition, Mayotte admitted that he failed to file federal income tax returns for tax years 2011 through 2014.
Leadingham, of Watseka, entered pleas of guilty on Nov. 28, 2017, to bank fraud and filing false income tax returns for tax years 2011, 2012, and 2013. Leadingham admitted that as the clinic’s office manager, she participated in the scheme by submitting fraudulent billing claims to the company. Leadingham then wrote checks payable to herself from the clinic’s checking account in addition to her salary. As a result, Leadingham obtained more than $380,000 to which she was not entitled. Further, Leadingham admitted that she did not disclose the additional income that she had fraudulently obtained from the clinic for her tax filings in 2011, 2012, and 2013.
The charges are the result of investigation by the FDIC Office of Inspector General; Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigations, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Eugene L. Miller and Timothy A. Bass represented the government in the case prosecutions.
The maximum statutory penalty for wire fraud is 20 years in prison; for bank fraud the penalty is up to 30 years in prison. The maximum statutory penalty is prescribed by Congress and is provided here for informational purposes; sentences are determined by the court based on the advisory Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.

South Florida Resident Convicted of $100 Million International Fraud Scheme that Led to Collapse of One of Puerto Rico’s Largest Banks,https://www.fdicoig.gov/news/investigations-press-releases/south-florida-resident-convicted-100-million-international-fraud,"February 5, 2019",2019,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

South Florida Resident Convicted of $100 Million International Fraud Scheme that Led to Collapse of One of Puerto Rico’s Largest Banks
A Key Biscayne, Florida resident was found guilty yesterday by a federal jury for his role in a $100 million scheme to defraud Westernbank of Puerto Rico (Westernbank); the losses triggered a series of events leading to Westernbank’s insolvency and ultimate collapse.  The defendant was also convicted of a $3 million scheme to defraud Mellon United National Bank of Miami (Mellon Bank).
Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Ariana Fajardo Orshan of the Southern District of Florida, Inspector General Jay N. Lerner of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Office of Inspector General (FDIC-OIG), Special Agent in Charge Michael De Palma of IRS Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI) for Miami and Puerto Rico, Special Agent in Charge Iván J. Arvelo of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) in San Juan and Special Agent in Charge Douglas A. Leff of the FBI’s San Juan, Puerto Rico Field Office made the announcement.
Jack Kachkar, 55, was convicted of eight counts of wire fraud affecting a financial institution after a three-week trial before U.S. District Judge Donald L. Graham of the Southern District of Florida.  Kachkar is scheduled to be sentenced by Judge Graham on April 30, 2019.
“Jack Kachkar engineered a massive fraud scheme that led directly to the failure of a major Puerto Rican bank with more than 1,500 employees,” said Assistant Attorney General Benczkowski.  “I want to commend the prosecutors and our law enforcement partners for their tireless work investigating this complex case and holding the defendant to account for these crimes.”
“Jack Kachkar’s fraud caused substantial harm to the 1,500 employees of Westernbank and the people of Puerto Rico,” said U.S. Attorney Fajardo Orshan. “The U.S. Attorney’s Office remains committed to the prosecution of those individuals and corporations that use Miami and other South Florida communities as their base to operate multinational fraud schemes.”
“Today’s verdict holds the defendant accountable for orchestrating fraudulent schemes that resulted in more than $100 million in losses to insured institutions and the FDIC as receiver,” said Inspector General Lerner.  “The FDIC Office of Inspector General remains committed to investigate cases of deception and swindles that undermine the integrity of financial institutions, and we will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to bring to justice those who commit such offenses.”
“IRS Criminal Investigation will always pursue investigations like this where Mr. Kachkar, for his own personal benefit, orchestrated such a large scheme at the expense of one of Puerto Rico’s largest banks and its 1,500 employees,” said IRS-CI Special Agent in Charge Palma.  “This investigation shows that the appearance of success can be a mask for a tangled financial web of lies, and we are proud to be part of the prosecution team that is bringing Mr. Kachkar to justice.”
“HSI San Juan will continue working with our local, state and federal partners to investigate and prosecute these types of cases as well as those involving violations to the more than 400 federal statutes that we investigate, “ said HSI Special Agent in Charge Arvelo.  “This man was responsible for one of the largest fraud schemes ever recorded in the banking business in Puerto Rico and he will pay the consequences.”
“This defendant’s greed was powerful enough to destroy a bank, taking with it the jobs of approximately 1,500 hard working citizens of Puerto Rico,” said FBI Special Agent in Charge Leff.  “The FBI thanks the US Attorney’s Office for sending an equally strong message that most fraud schemes will eventually lead to a prison cell.”
According to evidence presented at trial, from 2005 to 2007, Kachkar served as chairman and CEO of Inyx Inc., a publicly traded multinational pharmaceutical manufacturing company.  Beginning in early 2005, Kachkar caused Westernbank to enter into a series of loan agreements in exchange for a security interest in the assets of Inyx and its subsidiaries.  Under the loan agreements, Westernbank agreed to advance money based on Inyx’s customer invoices from “actual and bona fide” sales to Inyx customers, the evidence showed.
The trial evidence showed that Kachkar orchestrated a scheme to defraud Westernbank by causing numerous Inyx employees to make tens of millions of dollars worth of fake customer invoices purportedly payable by customers in the United Kingdom, Sweden and elsewhere.  Kachkar caused these invoices to be presented to Westernbank as valid invoices.   Kachkar made false and fraudulent representations to Westernbank executives about purported and imminent repayments from lenders in the United Kingdom, Norway, Libya and elsewhere in order to lull Westernbank into continuing to lend money to Inyx, the evidence showed.  In fact, these lenders had not agreed to repay Westernbank’s loan.  Kachkar made false and fraudulent representations to Westernbank executives that he had additional collateral, including purported mines in Mexico and Canada worth hundreds of millions of dollars, to induce Westernbank to lend additional funds, the evidence showed.  In fact, this additional collateral was worth barely a fraction of that represented by Kachkar.
During the course of the scheme, Kachkar caused Westernbank to lend approximately $142 million, primarily based on false and fraudulent customer invoices.  The evidence showed that the defendant diverted tens of millions of dollars for his own personal benefit, including for the purchase of, among other things, a private jet, luxury homes in Key Biscayne and Brickell, Miami, luxury cars, luxury hotel stays, and extravagant jewelry and clothing expenditures.
In or around June 2007, Westernbank declared the loan in default and ultimately suffered losses exceeding $100 million on the Inyx loans.  According to trial evidence, these losses later triggered a series of events leading to Westernbank’s insolvency and ultimate collapse.  At the time of its collapse, Westernbank had approximately 1,500 employees and was one of the largest banks in Puerto Rico.
In addition, the evidence showed, Kachkar knowingly deposited a $3 million check at Mellon Bank from the purported sale of his private jet.  At the time of its deposit, based on the evidence presented, Kachkar knew that the check was worthless.  In fact, the defendant agreed to sell his plane to a different buyer.   After receiving a provisional credit for the check from Mellon Bank, the defendant wired out all of the provisional credit, including a $1 million wire to Kachkar’s personal account in Canada.  Upon Mellon Bank’s request to reverse this $1 million wire, Kachkar refused to do so, resulting in at least a $1 million loss to Mellon Bank, the evidence showed.
This matter was investigated by the FDIC-OIG, IRS-CI, HSI and FBI.  The case is being prosecuted by Trial Attorney Michael O’Neill of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael N. Berger of the Southern District of Florida.",2025-11-24T23:14:32.437759
